Ma et al., Adv. Fund. Mater. 15, 1665 (2005); G. Li et al., Nat. Mater. 4, 864 (2005); M. Reyes-Reyes et al., Org. Lett. 7, 5749 (2005); J. Y. Kim et al., Adv. Mater. (Weinheim, Ger.) 18, 572 (2005); J. Peet et al., Nat. Mater. 6, 497 (2007)]. Poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecyllthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (pBTTT) has caused recent excitement in the organic electronics community because of its high reported hole mobility (0.6cm2V−1s−1) that was measured in field effect transistors and its ability to form large crystals. In this letter, we investigate the potential of pBTTT as light absorber and hole transporter in a bulk heterojunction solar cell. We find that the highest efficiency of 2.3% is achieved by using a 1:4 blend of pBTTT and[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester. The hole mobility as measured by space charge limited current modeling was found to be 3.8×10−4cm2V−1s..."

2,10.1021/ja710079w,2008,Processing additives for improved efficiency from bulk heterojunction solar cells.,"Two criteria for processing additives introduced to control the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) materials for use in solar cells have been identified: (i) selective (differential) solubility of the fullerene component and (ii) higher boiling point than the host solvent. Using these criteria, we have investigated the class of 1,8-di(R)octanes with various functional groups (R) as processing additives for BHJ solar cells. Control of the BHJ morphology by selective solubility of the fullerene component is demonstrated using these high boiling point processing additives. The best results are obtained with R = Iodine (I). Using 1,8-diiodooctane as the processing additive, the efficiency of the BHJ solar cells was improved from 3.4% (for the reference device) to 5.1%."

5,10.1021/JP8043016,2008,Effect of Polymer Nanoparticle Formation on the Efficiency of Polythiophene Based “Bulk-Heterojunction” Solar Cells,"Polythiophenes are being intensively studied for use in polymer/fullerene bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic (PV) devices because they absorb light throughout the entire visible spectrum and show high hole mobility, which are the two most important parameters for a successful donor in these devices. A large body of anecdotal information exists about what morphological features lead to a high efficiency bulk-heterojunction PV device, but few design parameters for improved polymers exist. We compare two polythiophene isomers, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(3,3′′′-didodecylquaterthiophene) (PQT-12) to determine which parameters make these two polymers more and less suitable for use in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. We find that although they have nearly identical absorption spectra and hole mobilities, the PV devices made using P3HT are far superior to those made using PQT-12 because the PQT-12 forms crystalline nanoparticles in solution that do not form electrical connections in the thin films.

Inverted polymer solar cells with the ZnO-C60 cathode display markedly improved power conversion efficiency compared to those with a pristine ZnO cathode, especially when the active layer includes the low-bandgap polymer PTB7-Th."
7,10.1002/adma.200903528,2010,For the Bright Future—Bulk Heterojunction Polymer Solar Cells with Power Conversion Efficiency of 7.4%,"Sun is the largest carbon-neutral energy source that has not been fully utilized. Although there are solar cell devices based on inorganic semiconductor to efficiently harvest solar energy, the cost of these conventional devices is too high to be economically viable. This is the major motivation for the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials and devices, which are envisioned to exhibit advantages such as low cost, flexibility, and abundant availability. [1] The past success in organic light-emitting diodes provides scientists with confidence that organic photovoltaic devices will be a vital alternate to the inorganic counterpart. At the heart of the OPV technology advantage is the easiness of the fabrication, which holds the promise of very low-cost manufacturing process. A simple, yet successful technique is the solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell composed of electron-donating semiconducting polymers and electron-withdrawing fullerides as active layers. [2] The composite active layer can be prepared as a large area in a single step by using techniques such as spin-coating, inkjet-printing, spraycoating, gravure-coating, roller-casting etc. [3] In the last fifteen years, a significant progress has been made on the improvement of the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer BHJ solar cells, and the achieved efficiencies have evolved from less than 1% in the poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) system in 1995, [2] to 4‐5% in the poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT) system in 2005, [4] to around 6%, as reported recently. [5] However, the efficiency of polymer solar cells is still significantly lower than their inorganic counterparts, such as silicon, CdTe and CIGS, which prevents practical applications in large scale."
8,10.1039/C4EE01529K,2014,Semi-crystalline photovoltaic polymers with efficiency exceeding 9% in a ∼300 nm thick conventional single-cell device,"We report a series of semi-crystalline, low band gap (LBG) polymers and demonstrate the fabrication of highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) in a thick single-cell architecture. The devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 7% without any post-treatment (annealing, solvent additive, etc.) and outstanding long-term thermal stability for 200 h at 130 °C. These excellent characteristics are closely related to the molecular structures where intra- and/or intermolecular noncovalent hydrogen bonds and dipole–dipole interactions assure strong interchain interactions without losing solution processability. The semi-crystalline polymers form a well-distributed nano-fibrillar networked morphology with PC70BM with balanced hole and electron mobilities (a h/e mobility ratio of 1–2) and tight interchain packing (a π–π stacking distance of 3.57–3.59 A) in the blend films. Furthermore, the device optimization with a processing additive and methanol treatment improves efficiencies up to 9.39% in a ∼300 nm thick conventional single-cell device structure. The thick active layer in the PPDT2FBT:PC70BM device attenuates incident light almost completely without damage in the fill factor (0.71–0.73), showing a high short-circuit current density of 15.7–16.3 mA cm−2. Notably, PPDT2FBT showed negligible changes in the carrier mobility even at ∼1 μm film thickness."
9,10.1039/B512373A,2006,"Poly(2,7-carbazole) and perylene tetracarboxydiimide: a promising donor/acceptor pair for polymer solar cells","A highly soluble polycarbazole (PCz) has been synthesized, and used as a donor material with perylene tetracarboxydiimide (PDI) as an acceptor and light harvesting material in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. This donor/acceptor (D/A) pair shows a broad absorption fit within the solar spectrum, and balanced potential levels for charge separation at the D/A interface. The best photovoltaic device exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16% at 490 nm and a power efficiency of 0.6% under illumination with solar light. The morphology of PCz/PDI films studied by SEM showed the formation of a favorable micro-phase separation, which is important in obtaining high efficiency. Incorporation of poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT) instead of PCz as donor produced a much lower Voc and thus a lower efficiency in solar cells."
10,10.1002/adfm.200600171,2006,"Synthesis of 2,7‐Carbazolenevinylene‐Based Copolymers and Characterization of Their Photovoltaic Properties","New electroactive and photoactive conjugated copolymers consisting of alternating 2,7‐carbazole and oligothiophene moieties linked by vinylene groups have been developed. Different oligothiophene units have been introduced to study the relationship between the polymer structure and the electronic properties. The resulting copolymers are characterized by UV‐vis spectroscopy, size‐exclusion chromatography, and thermal and electrochemical analyses. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells from different copolymers and a soluble fullerene derivative, [6,6]‐phenyl‐C61 butyric acid methyl ester, have been fabricated, and promising preliminary results are obtained. For instance, non‐optimized devices using poly(N‐(4‐octyloxyphenyl)‐2,7‐carbazolenevinylene‐alt‐3″,4″‐dihexyl‐2,2′;5′,2″;5″,2″′;5″′,2″″‐quinquethiophenevinylene 1″,1″‐dioxide) as an absorbing and hole‐carrier semiconductor exhibit power conversion efficiency up to 0.8 % under air mass (AM) 1.5 illumination.

11,10.1021/JA0771989,2008,"Toward a rational design of poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives for solar cells.","On the basis of theoretical models and calculations, several alternating polymeric structures have been investigated to develop optimized poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives for solar cell applications. Selected low band gap alternating copolymers have been obtained via a Suzuki coupling reaction. A good correlation between DFT theoretical calculations performed on model compounds and the experimental HOMO, LUMO, and band gap energies of the corresponding polymers has been obtained. This study reveals that the alternating copolymer HOMO energy level is mainly fixed by the carbazole moiety, whereas the LUMO energy level is mainly related to the nature of the electron-withdrawing comonomer. However, solar cell performances are not solely driven by the energy levels of the materials. Clearly, the molecular weight and the overall organization of the polymers are other important key parameters to consider when developing new polymers for solar cells. Preliminary measurements have revealed hole mobilities of about 1 x 10(-3) cm2 x V(-1) x s(-1) and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 3.6%. Further improvements are anticipated through a rational design of new symmetric low band gap poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives."

Fluorination of the DTQx units and the conjugated side groups of the BDT unit shows synergistic effect on molecular energy level modulation of the polymers, and as a result, the polymer PBQ-4 exhibits the deepest HOMO and LUMO levels in these four polymers. The characterizations of the photovoltaic properties of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on these four polymers reveal that the fluorination has little influence on short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) but is very helpful to enhance open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the devices. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the fluorination, the device based on PBQ-4 shows a high VOC of 0.90 V, which is 0.26 V higher than the polymer without fluorine and ca. 0.10 V higher than the other two polymers with less fluorine.

Although these two polymers have similar absorption bands and molecular energy levels, PBDTDTBT exhibits much better photovoltaic performance in polymer solar cell (PSC) devices with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.4%. To understand the differences between PBDTDTBT and PBDTBT, we have investigated the correlations of the molecular structure, morphology, dynamics and efficiency of these two polymers. A theoretical investigation using density functional theory (DFT) and time‐dependent DFT (TDDFT) has been employed to investigate the electron density and electron delocalization extent of the unimers. TEM data showed that PBDTDTBT phase separates from PC71BM, while PBDTBT suffers from having a proper morphology on different processing conditions. Grazing incidence wide angle X‐ray diffraction (GIWAXD) was used to probe the crystal structure of the polymers in thin film. A polymorph crystal structure was observed for PBDTBT. Grazing incidence small angle X‐ray scattering (GISAXS) was used to probe the size scale of phase separation, with an optimized 25 nm feature size observed for PBDTDTBT/PC71BM blends, which agrees well with TEM results. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was used to probe the dynamics of the fundamental processes in organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials, such as charge separation and recombination. The enhanced absorption coefficient, good charge separation, optimal phase separation and higher charge mobility all contribute to the high PCE of the PBDTDTBT/PC71BM devices."
37,10.1021/JP312450P,2013,Enhanced Photovoltaic Performance of Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)- Based Polymers with Extended π Conjugation,"To extend the π conjugation along backbone units is an effective way to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers. In this work, to investigate the influence of the extended conjugation on photovoltaic properties of the polymer, we employed a two-step molecular optimization process, and a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated polymers, PBDPP-1, PBDPP-2, and PBDPP-3, was prepared and applied in polymer solar cells. After this two-step optimization of molecular structure, the compatibility between the polymer and PC71BM becomes much better; as a result, bicontinuous phase separation with appropriate domain size can be formed in the blend of PBDPP-3/PC71BM. Therefore, the PBDPP-3/PC71BM-based device shows a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.25 mA/cm 2 , which is more than two times of that of the PBDPP-1/PC71BM- based device. In addition, the blend films processed by DIO/CB showed smoother surfaces as well as smaller domain size compared with the blend films processed by pure CB. The results in this work indicate that when conjugation of the DPP- polymer's backbone is extended in two dimensions the morphology of the active layers in photovoltaic device can be optimized effectively, and hence the overall efficiency can be improved from 2.83 to 6.18%."

The effect of different π-bridges and of the processing conditions on optical, electrical, morphological and photovoltaic properties of the polymer:fullerene blend films were investigated. The polymer containing the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge (PBDTFQ-TT) showed a red-shifted absorption and an enhanced charge carrier mobility, as compared to its analogue with the thiophene π-bridge (PBDTFQ-T), due to its narrower optical gap (by ∼0.1 eV) and stronger inter-chain interactions, favored by the structural planarity and increased linearity of the polymer backbone, as also supported by DFT calculations. The blend of PBDTFQ-TT and PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), compared to the PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM one processed under the same conditions (by blade-coating technique), showed greatly enhanced photovoltaic performance, with more than doubled power conversion efficiency (PCE up to 5.60% for the best device) due to the increased short-circuit current density and fill factor. However, similar PCEs were also achieved for PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM-based devices by optimizing the processing conditions through the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive. Through morphological and electrical analysis of the films, produced with and without additive, it was observed that the addition of DIO greatly enhances the self-organization, and consequently the charge mobility, of the thiophene π-bridge-based polymer, while it was detrimental for the nanoscale morphology and photovoltaic performances of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge-based polymer in the corresponding blend."

The physical properties of these polymers were finely tuned to optimize their photovoltaic effect. The substitution of alkoxy side chains to the less electron-donating alkyl chains or introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine into the polymer backbone reduced the HOMO energy levels of polymers. The structural modifications optimized polymers' spectral coverage of absorption and their hole mobility, as well as miscibility with fulleride, and enhanced polymer solar cell performances. The open circuit voltage, V(oc), for polymer solar cells was increased by adjusting polymer energy levels. It was found that films with finely distributed polymer/fulleride interpenetrating network exhibited improved solar cell conversion efficiency. Efficiency over 6% has been achieved in simple solar cells based on fluorinated PTB4/PC(61)BM films prepared from mixed solvents. The results proved that polymer solar cells have a bright future."
41,10.1039/C5PY00071H,2015,"Optimization of side chains in alkylthiothiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-based photovoltaic polymers","Alkyl side chains play critical roles in the molecular design of conjugated polymers for applications in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). Recently, the introduction of alkylthio substituents onto poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) (PBDTTT)-based conjugated polymers has been proved to be an effective method to improve the photovoltaic properties of the polymers. In this contribution, three alkylthiothiophene-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT-TS) based polymers, named PBDT-TS1, PBDT-TS2 and PBDT-TS3, were synthesized and applied as donor materials in PSCs. In these three polymers, octyl, 2-ethylhexyl and 3,7-dimethyloctyl are used on their BDT units, respectively. The polymers were characterized in parallel by absorption spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS), and also their photovoltaic properties in PSCs were studied and compared. The results reveal that the alkyls have little influence on absorption spectra and molecular energy levels of the polymers. The GI-WAXS results show that PBDT-TS1 has stronger and tighter π–π stacking than the other two polymers, implying that linear alkyls may reduce steric hindrance than branched alkyl chains in an aggregation state. As a consequence of the strong π–π inter-chain packing of PBDT-TS1, an increased short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) as well as a power conversion efficiency of over 9.5% are achieved in single-cell BHJ devices, which are obviously higher than those for devices based on the other two polymers. Overall, the results of this work suggest that alkyl side groups play an important role in affecting the π–π stacking of the conjugated polymers, i.e., the linear octyl has weaker steric hindrance for the inter-chain π–π stack than the branched 2-ethylhexyl and 3,7-dimethyloctyl, and for the highly efficient polymer based on the 2-alkylthiothiophene-substituted BDT, PBDT-TS1 has the optimal structure."

After adjusting device parameters, these TPD-based polymers used with PC(61)BM provided photovoltaic responses ranging from 4.0% to 6.8%, depending on the size and shape of the alkyl solubilizing groups. Further, we have correlated the effect of the alkyl groups on the structural order and orientation of the polymer backbone using grazing incidence X-ray scattering analysis, and we have demonstrated how fine-tuning of these parameters can improve the power conversion efficiency."

44,10.1021/ja108601g,2011,Synthesis of fluorinated polythienothiophene-co-benzodithiophenes and effect of fluorination on the photovoltaic properties.,"Herein, we describe the synthesis of fluorinated polythienothiophene-co-benzodithiophenes (PTBFs) and the characterization of their physical properties, especially their performance in solar cells. Fluorination of the polymer backbone lowered both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and simultaneously widened the energy bandgap of the polymer (0.1-0.2 eV). Incorporation of fluorine into the various positions of the polymer backbone significantly affected the solar cells' power conversion efficiency from 2.3% to 7.2%. Detailed studies revealed that the polymer containing mono-fluorinated thienothiophene gave the best solar cell performance. Perfluorination of the polymer backbone led to poor compatibility with PC(71)BM molecules, thus poor solar energy conversion efficiency. This is possibly due to the enhanced self-organization properties of the polymer chains and the fluorophobicity effect. Furthermore, it was found that perfluorination of the polymer backbone resulted in poor photochemical stability against singlet oxygen attack. Theoretical studies indicated that the internal polarization caused enhancement of the negative charge density on thienothiophene rings, which rendered them vulnerable to [2+4] cycloaddition reaction with singlet oxygen."

Higher power conversion efficiencies of 5.00% for PBDT-T-FBSe and 4.65% for PIDT-T-FBSe were achieved in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/bis-C60/Ag under the illumination of AM1.5G at 100 mA cm−2. These results demonstrate the importance of FBSe as an electron-deficient unit in the design of donor–acceptor photovoltaic polymers."

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type polymer solar cells now play a leading role in realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The development of new polymer materials to further improve the efficiencies of BHJ-type PSCs will accelerate their commercial application. At present, P3HT-PCBM-based PSCs (P3HT= poly(3-hexylthiophene), PCBM=methanofullerene (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) have exhibited high efficiencies of 4–5%. However, the narrow absorption spectrum of P3HT in 300–650 nm is one of the main hindrances to the further improvement of the efficiencies of P3HT-based devices. To overcome this problem, some low-band-gap polymer materials as donors have been synthesized successfully and applied to photovoltaic devices. Large short-circuit current density (Jsc) and higher efficiencies have been demonstrated using this strategy. In spite of the high Jsc achievable with low-band-gap polymers, the device performance suffers owing to the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.5–0.7 V. According to published models and experimental results, theVoc of a PSC is closely related to the offset between energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. Thus, to enhance the opencircuit voltage of these devices, some building blocks with lower-lying HOMOs should be introduced in donor molecules to lower their HOMO levels. Polyfluorene and its derivatives are a well-known class of wide-band-gap organic semiconducting materials. Many donor polymers containing fluorene on the main chain were reported to show lower HOMO levels and correspondingly exhibited higher open-circuit voltages. However, the wider band gaps of these polymers resulted in lower values of Jsc and consequently lower efficiencies. To enhance the efficiency, there is a need for a low-band-gap polymers that can have a high Voc. Few polymers with high open-circuit voltages (above 0.8 V) and consequently high PCEs (above 5%) have been reported to date, except for two kinds of polymers, poly[(2,7silafluorene)-alt-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PSiFDBT) and poly[N-9’’-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt5,5-(4’,7’-di-2-thienyl-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT), both of which contain a fluorene unit in the polymer main chain. Considering the similarity in the molecular structures of PSiFDBTand PCDTBTwith analogous fluorene units in both of their main chains, it is necessary to explore new molecular structures with favorable characteristics for higher opencircuit voltages and conversion efficiencies.

UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers show broad and strong absorption bands from 300–750 nm both in CHCl3 solutions and films. The resulting copolymers exhibit relatively deep HOMO energy levels (−5.56 and −5.46 eV) and surprisingly high hole mobilities (2.2 × 10−1 and 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) for PBDTPO-DTBO and PBDTPO-DTBT, respectively.

The side chains of the BDT units altered the solubility, conformations, and electronic properties of the synthesized conjugated polymers, allowing tuning of their photovoltaic properties when blended with fullerenes. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the presence of these side chain groups on the BDT donor units affected the torsion angles between the side chain groups and the conjugated main chains but resulted in only slightly different energy levels for the highest occupied molecular orbitals for these polymers, consistent with results obtained experimentally using cyclic voltammetry.

61,10.1021/ja309289u,2013,Fluorine substituents reduce charge recombination and drive structure and morphology development in polymer solar cells.,"Three structurally identical polymers, except for the number of fluorine substitutions (0, 1, or 2) on the repeat unit (BnDT-DTBT), are investigated in detail, to further understand the impact of these fluorine atoms on open circuit voltage (V(oc)), short circuit current (J(sc)), and fill factor (FF) of related solar cells. While the enhanced V(oc) can be ascribed to a lower HOMO level of the polymer by adding more fluorine substituents, the improvement in J(sc) and FF are likely due to suppressed charge recombination. While the reduced bimolecular recombination with raising fluorine concentration is confirmed by variable light intensity studies, a plausibly suppressed geminate recombination is implied by the significantly increased change of dipole moment between the ground and excited states (Δμ(ge)) for these polymers as the number of fluorine substituents increases. Moreover, the 2F polymer (PBnDT-DTffBT) exhibits significantly more scattering in the in-plane lamellar stacking and out-of-plane π-π stacking directions, observed with GIWAXS. This indicates that the addition of fluorine leads to a more face-on polymer crystallite orientation with respect to the substrate, which could contribute to the suppressed charge recombination. R-SoXS also reveals that PBnDT-DTffBT has larger and purer polymer/fullerene domains. The higher domain purity is correlated with an observed decrease in PCBM miscibility in polymer, which drops from 21% (PBnDT-DTBT) to 12% (PBnDT-DTffBT). The disclosed ""fluorine"" impact not only explains the efficiency increase from 4% of PBnDT-DTBT (0F) to 7% with PBnDT-DTffBT (2F) but also suggests fluorine substitution should be generally considered in the future design of new polymers."

The PCE of 8.30% for P3 is the highest value for the reported traditional single-junction polymer solar cells via a simple fabrication architecture without any additives or post-treatments. In addition, it is noteworthy that P3 also allows making high efficient polymer solar cells with high PCEs of 7.27 and 6.56% under the same condition for ~200 and ~300 nm thickness active layers, respectively.

Through the use of quantitative morphological measurements, it is demonstrated that devices based on benzodithiophene and fluorinated benzotriazole moieties constitute an exception to this design rule and exhibit a range of morphologies that yield similar high performance. In particular, the fill factor (FF) remains above 65% even with factor of two changes in domain size and factor of two changes in relative domain purity. Devices with active layer thicknesses of 250 nm are employed, which are capable of increasing optical absorption to produce high photocurrent. The general insensitivity to both morphology and thickness is likely related to the measured low equilibrium miscibility of fullerene in the polymer of 3‐4%. The materials and processes investigated therefore provide insights into functional material design that yield increased processing latitude and may be more amenable to roll‐to‐roll processing."

The polymer solar cell fabricated from the blend of the polymer as donor and PC71BM as acceptor exhibited a moderate power conversion efficiency of 2.81% with a high Voc of 0.94 V without annealing and any additives. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the highest Voc values for PSCs based on benzodithiophene derivatives.

The introduction of fluorine substituents remarkably influenced the molecular architecture, optical, electrochemical, and morphological properties of the polymers, as well as the optoelectronic performance of the devices made from these materials. The introduction of fluorine substituents on the benzothiadiazole unit not only down-shifted the HOMO energy level of the organic semiconductor but also enhanced the intra- and intermolecular interactions of the resulting conjugated polymer. As a result, the open-circuit voltage and mobility of corresponding devices based on the fluorinated polymer were enhanced markedly.

PBDTT–DTTBT and PBDTT–DTBT films show broad absorption in the visible range with an absorption edge at over 751 nm, and possess relatively low-lying HOMO levels at −5.11 eV and 5.15 eV. A high hole mobility of 1.97 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was recorded for PBDTT–DTTBT, that is two orders of magnitude higher than PBDTT–DTBT (1.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is ascribed to the application of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as π-bridge units.

PBDT–TBT has a zigzagged chain conformation (Z-type), while PBDT–TTBT has a linear chain conformation (L-type). The results show that the polymer chain conformation significantly affects the optoelectronic properties of the polymers. With the conformation change from Z-type to L-type, the J-aggregation of the polymer was enhanced greatly, i.e. PBDT–TTBT shows a much more prominent absorption shoulder peak at the long wavelength direction compared to PBDT–TBT. In the X-ray diffraction analysis, it was found that the L-type polymer shows much stronger crystallinity than the Z-type polymer. Benefiting from the enhanced inter-chain π–π stacking effect, the blend of PBDT–TTBT/PC71BM showed higher hole mobility compared to the blend of PBDT–TBT/PC71BM. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the polymer solar cells based on PBDT–TTBT/PC71BM and PBDT–TTBT/PC71BM are 6.3% and 4.9%, respectively.

The effect of the heteroatom substitution on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties and charge carrier mobilities of these polymers is discussed. The results indicate that by increasing the size of the chalcogen atom (S < Se < Te), polymer band gaps are narrowed mainly due to LUMO energy level stabilization. In addition, the larger heteroatomic size also increases intermolecular heteroatom-heteroatom interactions facilitating the formation of polymer aggregates leading to enhanced field-effect mobilities of 1.6 cm(2)/(V s). Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the chalcogenophene polymer series blended with fullerene derivatives show good photovoltaic properties, with power conversion efficiencies ranging from 7.1-8.8%.

However, these substituents impact structural order and charge transport properties in thin-film devices. As a result, a trade-off must be found between material solubility and insulating alkyl content. It was recently shown that the substitution of furan for thiophene in the backbone of the polymer PDPP2FT significantly improves polymer solubility, allowing for the use of shorter branched side chains while maintaining high device efficiency. In this report, we use PDPP2FT to demonstrate that linear alkyl side chains can be used to promote thin-film nanostructural order. In particular, linear side chains are shown to shorten π-π stacking distances between backbones and increase the correlation lengths of both π-π stacking and lamellar spacing, leading to a substantial increase in the efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells."

The morphology of the DT-DPP:[70]PCBM blends is characterized by a semicrystalline fibrillar microstructure with fibril widths between 4.5 and 30 nm as evidenced from transmission electron microscopy. A clear correlation is found between the widths of the fibrils and the EQE for photon to electron conversion. The highest EQEs (60%) and power conversion efficiencies (7.1%) are obtained for polymers with fibril widths less than 12 nm. For blends with fibrils wider than 12 nm, the EQE is low because exciton diffusion becomes limiting for charge generation. Interestingly, the correlation found here matches with previous data on related DPP-based polymers. This suggests that for this class of materials the relation between fiber width and EQE is universal. The fiber width is largely correlated with the solubility of the polymers, with less soluble DPP-based polymers giving narrower fibrils."
81,10.1039/C4TA04118F,2014,Comparing random and regular diketopyrrolopyrrole–bithiophene–thienopyrrolodione terpolymers for organic photovoltaics,"Isomeric random and regular alternating π-conjugated terpolymers comprising diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), thienopyrrolodione (TPD), and bithiophene (2T) were synthesized to study the effect of the sequential distribution of monomeric units on the semiconducting properties. The optical and electrochemical properties and the performance in photovoltaic cells of the random and regular terpolymers are found to be significantly different. DPP2T-rich sections in the random terpolymer cause higher HOMO and deeper LUMO energy levels and a smaller optical band gap compared to the regular terpolymer. The randomization of DPP and TPD units along the chain has a negative effect on the photovoltaic performance, resulting in power conversion efficiencies of merely 1.0% for the random terpolymer while a more favorable efficiency of 5.3% is obtained for the regular terpolymer when combined with a fullerene acceptor."

The electron deficiency of the BTI units leads to polymers with a low-lying HOMOs (∼-5.6 eV). Inverted solar cells are fabricated to investigate the OPV performance of the BTI-based polymers and achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 5.5%, with substantial V(oc)s above 0.9 V which are among the highest V(oc)s reported to date for polymer/PCBM solar cells. The results indicate that the BTI is a promising building block for constructing polymer donors for OPV applications."
83,10.1039/C5TA05885F,2015,Molecular engineering of benzothienoisoindigo copolymers allowing highly preferential face-on orientations,"Orientation of conjugated polymers is increasingly important in organic photovoltaics (OPV) to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The optimized orientation of conjugated backbones for photo-generated charge carriers in OPV devices is in contrast to organic semiconductor devices, demanding new strategies to control and realize face-on orientation of conjugated systems onto substrates. Here we report new conjugated polymers composed of electron-accepting benzothienoisoindigo (BTIDG), an asymmetric unit of isoindigo and thienoisoindigo. BTIDG was coupled with weakly electron-donating thiazolothiazole or benzobisthiazole, concurrently leading to moderate optical band gaps (1.41–1.52 eV) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (−5.35 to −5.50 eV). The alkylthiophene spacer between BTIDG and the donor unit provided a marked control over the orientation of polymers, among which the degree of face-on orientation as high as 95% was revealed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. The maximum PCE was improved up to 4.2% using the system with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). We present a useful basis on the structure (orientation)–property (OPV output) relationship to lay down new guidelines for the design of efficient solar cell materials."

An analog of isoindigo, thus so-called thienoisoindigo, was coupled to benzodithiophene, cyclopentadithiophene, and fluorene, affording a low bandgap and an appropriate LUMO level (−3.8 eV) for n-type methanofullerene (PCBM). A laser and Xe-flash-time-resolved microwave conductivity was extensively applied for guiding the processing conditions (p/n blend ratio, solvent, and thermal annealing), giving clearly defined optimized parameters. OPV performances are discussed in-depth in conjunction with atomic force microscope, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, modulation of light intensity, field-effect transistor, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. We found that excessively shortened singlet exciton lifetime of polymer (<1 ps) competes with the photocurrent generation, which may arise from its near-infrared absorbing nature.

85,10.1021/acsami.6b16502,2017,Morphology Control in Films of Isoindigo Polymers by Side-Chain and Molecular Weight Effects.,"The performance of devices relying on organic electronic materials, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFET) and organic photovoltaics (OPV), is strongly correlated to the morphology of the conjugated material in thin films. For instance, several factors such as polymer solubility, weak intermolecular forces between polymers and fullerene derivatives, and film drying time impact phase separation in the active layer of a bulk heterojunction OPV device. In an effort to probe the influence of polymer assembly on morphology of polymer thin films and phase separation with fullerene derivatives, five terthiophene-alt-isoindigo copolymers were synthesized with alkyl side-chains of varying lengths and branching on the terthiophene unit. These P[T3(R)-iI] polymers were designed to have similar optoelectronic properties but different solubilities in o-dichlorobenzene and were predicted to have different tendencies for crystallization. All polymers with linear alkyl chains exhibit similar thin film morphologies as investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The main differences in electronic and morphological properties arise when P[T3(R)-iI] is substituted with branched 2-ethylhexyl (2EH) side-chains. The bulky 2EH substituents lead to a blue-shifted absorption, a lower ionization potential, and reduced ordering in polymer thin films. The five P[T3-iI] derivatives span hole mobilities from 1.5 × 10-3 to 2.8 × 10-2 cm2 V-1 s-1 in OFET devices. In OPV devices, the 2EH-substituted polymers yield open-circuit voltages of 0.88 V in BHJ devices yet low short-circuit currents of 0.8 mA cm-2, which is explained by the large phase separation observed by AFM in blends of P[T3(2EH)-iI] with PC71BM. In these P[T3(R)-iI] systems, the propensity for the polymers to self-assemble prior to aggregation of PC71BM molecules was key to achieving fine phase separation and increased short-circuit currents, eventually resulting in power conversion efficiencies of 5% in devices processed using a single solvent."

The low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the polymers contribute to reducing injection barriers for both electrons and holes, resulting in ambipolar operation of FET devices. The charge mobilities were strongly affected by the molecular orientation of the copolymers, and the highest electron mobility of 0.26 cm2/(V s) was observed for the copolymer with thienothiophene unit with edge-on orientation. On the other hand, OSCs with PTB7 as the electron donor polymer and the copolymers as the acceptor showed a broad photoresponse extending to the near-IR region, and the highest power conversion efficiency of over 3.5% was obtained for the copolymer with dithienothiophene unit th..."
87,10.1039/C4EE00446A,2014,Improvement of open-circuit voltage and photovoltaic properties of 2D-conjugated polymers by alkylthio substitution,"Low bandgap and two-dimensional (2D)-conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene with conjugated thiophene side chains (BDTT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene with electron-withdrawing substituents (TT) are attractive high efficiency polymer donor materials in polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we introduced an alkylthio substituent on the thiophene side chain in the polymer and synthesized a new low bandgap 2D-conjugated polymer PBDTT-S-TT. The alkylthio substituent increased the hole mobility of the polymer to 4.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and down-shifted the HOMO energy level of the polymer by 0.11 eV with absorption of the polymer film red-shifted slightly. The PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as an acceptor without solvent additive treatment demonstrated a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.84 V, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.42%, under the illumination of AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2. For comparison, the Voc and PCE of the devices based on the corresponding parent polymer PBDTT-TT with the device optimization of 3% DIO additive treatment are 0.77 V and 7.38%, respectively. The enhanced Voc value of 0.84 V for the PSC based on PBDTT-S-TT should be benefited from the down-shifted HOMO energy level of the polymer. The results indicate that the alkylthio substitution is an effective way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the 2D-conjugated polymer donor materials in PSCs."

To improve photovoltaic performance of PSCs, tremendous efforts have been devoted to designing, synthesizing and optimizing photovoltaic polymers with superior photovoltaic properties, such as suitable molecular energy levels, broad absorption band, high hole mobility, and so on. Since the first introduction of 2-alkylthienyl as the conjugated side groups in the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units, the alkylthienyl substituted BDT (BDT-T) units have been widely used to construct novel photovoltaic polymers and thereby the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been boosted to several new heights in the field of PSCs. For instance, Chen et al. lately reported a photovoltaic polymer (named as PTB7-Th, see Scheme 1a) with superior photovoltaic properties by incorporating the 2-(2ethylhexyl)-thienyl group into the BDT unit of the well-known photovoltaic polymer, PTB7."

With NTz's highly π-extended structure and strong electron affinity, the NTz-based polymer (PNTz4T) affords a smaller bandgap and a deeper HOMO level than the BTz-based polymer (PBTz4T). PNTz4T exhibits not only high field-effect mobilities of ~0.56 cm(2)/(V s) but also high photovoltaic properties with power conversion efficiencies of ~6.3%, both of which are significantly high compared to those for PBTz4T. This is most likely due to the more suitable electronic properties and, importantly, the more highly ordered structure of PNTz4T in the thin film than that of PBTz4T, which might originate in the different symmetry between the cores. NTz, with centrosymmetry, can lead to a more linear backbone in the present polymer system than BTz with axisymmetry, which might be favorable for better molecular ordering. These results demonstrate great promise for using NTz as a bulding unit for high-performance semiconducting polymers for both transistors and solar cells."

A striking feature of the present polymers is the very close π-π stacking of 3.5 Å, most likely as a result of the large π system and the D-A system in the polymer backbone. PNDT3NTz-DT, in particular, is found to be one of the few examples of versatile polymers that exhibit both the field-effect mobility of ∼0.5 cm2/(V s) and the PCE of ∼5%.

In this study, new semiconducting polymers based on naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c']bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTz), PNTz4TF2 and PNTz4TF4, having 3,3'-difluoro-2,2'-bithiophene and 3,3',4,4'-tetrafluoro-2,2'-bithiophene, respectively, are designed and synthesized. These polymers possess a deeper HOMO energy level than their counterpart, PNTz4T, which results in higher open-circuit voltages in solar cells. This concequently reduces the photon energy loss that is one of the most important issues surrounding PSCs. The PNTz4TF4 cell exhibits up to 6.5% power conversion efficiency (PCE), whereas the PNTz4TF2 cell demonstrates outstanding device performance with as high as 10.5% PCE, which is quite high for PSCs. We further discuss the performances of the PSCs based on these polymers by correlating the charge generation and recombination dynamics with the polymer structure and ordering structure. We believe that the results provide new insights into the design of semiconducting polymers and that there is still much room for improvement of PSC efficiency."

The distannylated α‐aNDT and β‐aNDT monomers are copolymerized with the Br‐DTNT monomer by the Stille coupling to furnish two isomeric copolymers, PαNDTDTNT and PβNDTDTNT, respectively. The geometric shape and coplanarity of the isomeric α‐aNDT and β‐aNDT segments in the polymers play a decisive role in determining their macroscopic device performance. Theoretical calculations show that PαNDTDTNT possesses more linear polymeric backbone and higher coplanarity than PβNDTDTNT. The less curved conjugated main chain facilitates stronger intermolecular π–π interactions, resulting in more redshifted absorption spectra of PαNDTDTNT in both solution and thin film compared to the PβNDTDTNT counterpart. 2D wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction analysis reveals that PαNDTDTNT has more ordered π‐stacking and lamellar stacking than PβNDTDTNT as a result of the lesser curvature of the PαNDTDTNT backbone. Consistently, PαNDTDTNT exhibits a greater field effect transistor hole mobility of 0.214 cm2 V−1 s−1 than PβNDTDTNT with a mobility of 0.038 cm2 V−1 s−1.

One drawback of this class of polymers is their relatively low ionization potential, which leads to rather low open‐circuit voltages. Polyterthiophenes belong to a material class that has recently captured a large amount of interest for polymer electronic applications because of its excellent transport properties. Because of the slightly lower ionization potential, this material class appears more attractive for photovoltaic applications than polythiophenes. In this work, the photovoltaic performance of bulk heterojunction solar cells from polyterthiophene/fullerene composites is discussed and compared to the polymer/fullerene blend morphology."
108,10.1021/am502795y,2014,Effects of cyano-substituents on the molecular packing structures of conjugated polymers for bulk-heterojunction solar cells.,"The molecular packing structures of two conjugated polymers based on alkoxy naphthalene, one with cyano-substituents and one without, have been investigated to determine the effects of electron-withdrawing cyano-groups on the performance of bulk-heterojunction solar cells. The substituted cyano-groups facilitate the self-assembly of the polymer chains, and the cyano-substituted polymer:PC71BM blend exhibits enhanced exciton dissociation to PC71BM. Moreover, the electron-withdrawing cyano-groups lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the conjugated polymer, which leads to a higher open circuit voltage (V(OC)) and a lower energy loss during electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. A bulk-heterojunction device fabricated with the cyano-substituted polymer:PC71BM blend has a higher V(OC) (0.89 V), a higher fill factor (FF) (51.4%), and a lower short circuit current (J(SC)) (7.4 mA/cm(2)) than that of the noncyano-substituted polymer:PC71BM blend under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm(-2). Thus, the cyano-substitution of conjugated polymers may be an effective strategy for optimizing the domain size and crystallinity of the polymer:PC71BM blend, and for increasing V(OC) by tuning the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymer."

We systematically controlled the energy levels of donor polymers by introducing cyano (CN) and alkoxy (OR) groups into the 4,4′-didodecyl-2,2′-bithiophene (BT) unit in a step-by-step fashion, thereby varying the inductive and resonance effects. The three monomer units (BT, BTC, and BTCox) were polymerized with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as a counter unit to afford three polymers (PBDT-BT, PBDT-BTC, and PBDT-BTCox).

113,10.1021/MA101523A,2010,"A Thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione-Based Donor-Acceptor Polymer Exhibiting High Crystallinity for Photovoltaic Applications","Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures that consist of polymeric donors and fullerene-based acceptors are attracting considerable attention because of their fascinating potential for low-cost, large-area production through solution processing. Because donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated polymers possess high light-harvesting aptitude, easily tunable optical/electronic properties, and ambipolar charge transporting features, they have been applied extensively to BHJ photovoltaics in the past few years. Specifically, the D-A design concept is the most effective strategy toward harvesting more photons by lowering optical bandgaps while retaining suitable electronic energy levels. In recent years, several efficient D-A polymers have displayed promising potentialities for photovoltaic applications. For instance, electron-deficient units derived from 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (BO), 3,6-diaryl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP), and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate moieties, when conjugated with various electron-donating units, such as fluorene, carbazole, dithienosilole, and benzodithiophene, have demonstrated distinguished PCEs of up to 7% after systematic optimization. The electron-deficient thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) moiety exhibits a symmetric, rigidly fused, coplanar structure and strong electron-withdrawing properties, which make it a potential system for increasing intramolecular/intermolecular interactions, reducing optical bandgaps, and/or lowering highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels when incorporated into polymeric backbones. Very recently, low-bandgap D-A polymers, comprising TPD and benzodithiophene moieties, were prepared that featured relatively low-lying HOMO energy levels (-5.43 to -5.57 eV), high open-circuit voltages (Voc, up to 0.89 V), and prominent PCEs (4-6%). When designing new efficient D-A polymers, it is important to select suitable electron donors as well as acceptors by taking into consideration their spectral absorption ranges and electronic energy levels. Furthermore, the development of new D-A polymers exhibiting crystalline characteristics can lead to significantly enhanced charge transporting mobilities in the active layers of the devices. Several p-type conjugated polymers containing the symmetric bi(dodecyl)thiophene unit exhibit crystalline characteristics and high hole mobilities when used in organic field effect transisitors. Considering not only the electronic energy level but also the hole mobility, we prepared a newD-Apolymer, PBTTPD,wherein the electronwithdrawing TPD unit was conjugated with the symmetrical electron-donating bi(dodecyl)thiophene unit to provide crystalline characteristics and a low-lying HOMO energy level, resulting from the combination of the rigidly fused TPD moiety and the symmetrical bi(dodecyl)thiopheneunits.Becauseof these desirable features, we expected PBTTPD to exhibit good hole mobility and high values of Voc when used in photovoltaic applications. We prepared PBTTPD (Scheme 1) through Stille polymerization of themonomers 1,3-dibromo-5-ethylhexylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6dione (M1) and 4,40-didocecyl-5,50-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,20-bithiophene (M2) using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium/tri(o-tolyl)phosphine [Pd2dba3/P(o-tolyl)3] as the catalyst. The branched 2-ethylhexyl chain of theTPDmoietywas present to promote the solubility of the polymer. The number-average molecular weight of PBTTPD was 9.7 kg mol, with a polydispersity of 1.4, as determined through gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using chloroform as the eluent. This polymer was readily soluble in hot chlorinated solvents, namely chloroform, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene. PBTTPD exhibited good thermal stability, with its decomposition temperature (Td) greater than 400 C, as measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Supporting Information, Figure S1). We investigated the thermal behavior of this polymer using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which revealed two distinct peaks;a melting point at 297 C and a crystallization point at 268 C;but no glass transition (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The presence of the pronounced crystallization peak indicated that PBTTPD had a strong inclination to crystallize, which we further confirmed from its film’s grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction pattern (Figure 1a). In Figure 1a, the (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks for PBTTPD are at 3.4 , 6.8 , and 10.2 , respectively, indicating a highly ordered structure along with a d-spacing of 26 A that is ascribable to the interchain distance separated by the alkyl side chains; the broad feature at 24.6 , corresponding to a short distance of 3.6 A, is assigned to the facialπ-π stacking between polymeric backbones; such high crystallinity suggested that PBTTPD would exhibit good carrier mobility when applied in PSCs. Figure 1b presents absorption spectra of PBTTPD in dilute chloroform solution and in the solid state. In solution, the polymer exhibited an absorption signal at 468 nm, which we assign to internal charge transfer between the TPD acceptor and the bithiophene donor. The absorption maximum of the solid state polymer appeared at 572 nm;a significant red shift of 104 nm relative to that in solution, indicating that considerably strong intermolecular interactions existed in the solid film. Additionally, a vibronic shoulder at 628 nm implies an ordered arrangement of PBTTPD in the solid film, with strong π-π stacking between the polymeric backbones, a feature that also appears in regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene). The optical bandgap of PBTTPD, estimated from the onset of absorption in the solid film, was 1.82 eV; this value is less than that of P3HT (1.91 eV) because of the presence of the electron-accepting TPD moiety in the polymer main chain; accordingly, we expected that PBTTPD would harvest more photons relative to P3HT. Figure S3 presents the redox behavior of the polymer (see Supporting Information). On the basis of the onset potentials, we Scheme 1. Synthetic Route and Structure of PBTTPD"

In this study, three wide band gap polymers, P1, P2, and P3, were synthesized by Stille coupling of the electron-acceptor unit of phthalimide (PhI) and the electron-donor unit of 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy), 4,8-bis(n-dodecyloxy) and 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) benzodithiophene (BDT), respectively, and then were physicochemically characterized. Optical tests found that all these three polymers displayed a film absorption peak around 500 nm and their optical band gap is in the range of 2.07–2.13 eV. Electrochemical tests indicated that the three polymers possess deeply layered HOMO energy levels (−5.36 eV to −5.57 eV). P1 is poorly soluble, however P2 and P3 were both applied in PSCs with PC71BM as the electron-acceptor material. The photovoltaic tests indicated that both the polymers exhibited a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V (P2) and 0.89 V (P3) because of their deeper HOMOs than P3HT. Polymer P2 with 4,8-bis(n-dodecyloxy) BDT as the electron-donor unit exhibited poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.50%, while P3, containing 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) BDT and PhI, exhibited a promising PCE of 3.70%. This significant increase of the PCE is mainly from the nearly 2-fold increase of the short-circuit current density, Jsc (7.01 mA cm−2vs. 3.43 mA cm−2) and also from an improvement in both the fill factor, FF (58.6% vs. 54.7%), and Voc (0.89 V vs. 0.80 V). We attribute the promoted photovoltaic performance of P3 with respect to P2 to its broader absorption, deeper HOMO level, weaker molecular aggregation, better miscibility with PC71BM, optimized film morphology, and finally, better hole mobility compared to P2, all of which originated from the structure differences between alkoxyl and alkylthienyl BDT. The PCE for P3 is, to the best of our knowledge, among the top 2 efficiencies for the wide band gap polymers (the highest one is 5.04% reported very recently in Polym. Chem., 2013, 4, 57) and the highest efficiency reported to date for PhI-based polymers. Our results enriched the tool-box for wide band gap polymers with enhanced efficiencies higher than 3.5%. Accordingly, the wide band gap polymer, P3, should be a potential candidate for applications in tandem solar cells."

The number-average molecular weight was moderate to high (20–103 kDa) for four of the new copolymers and low (<10 kDa) for the rest. The optical band gap (1.7–2.2 eV) and the ionization potential (4.9–5.7 eV) of the copolymers could be tuned by varying the strength of the electron-donating comonomers. X-ray diffraction analysis of the neat TT polymer thin films showed that they exhibit a lamellar crystalline morphology with a (100) d-spacing of 1.449–1.881 nm. The polymers had field-effect hole mobilities of 2 × 10–3–3 × 10–2 cm2/(V s).

This polymer uses alkyl‐substituted thiophene as a bridge. The PBDTT‐LTPD includes two TPD units in one repeating unit, which can enhance acceptor density in the polymer backbone and lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level. By contrast, variable alkyl substitutions in the thiophene‐bridges ensure the subtle regulation of polymer properties. The solar cells based on PBDTT‐LTPD display an open‐circuit voltage (Voc) that exceeds 1 V, and a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.59% is obtained. This PCE value is the highest for conventional single‐junction bulk heterojunction solar cells with Voc values of up to 1 V. Given that PBDTT‐LTPD exhibits a low HOMO energy level and a band gap equivalent to that of poly(3‐hexylthiophene), PBDTT‐LTPD/phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester may be a promising candidate for the front cell in tandem polymer solar cells."

In PBDTTPD, side chains of varying size and branching affect polymer self-assembly, nanostructural order, and impact material performance. However, the role of the polymer side-chain pattern in the intimate mixing between polymer donors and PCBM acceptors, and on the development of the BHJ morphology is in general less understood. In this contribution, we show that ring substituents such as furan (F), thiophene (T) and selenophene (S)—incorporated into the side chains of PBDTTPD polymers—can induce significant and, of importance, very different morphological effects in BHJs with PCBM.

The resulting copolymers show large band gaps, deep HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Improved V(oc), J(sc), and FF were obtained at the same time to increase overall efficiencies of their single and tandem polymer solar cells. The enhanced V(oc) can be ascribed to a low-lying HOMO energy level by incorporating dialkylthiol and fluorine substituents on the polymer backbone. The improvement in J(sc) and FF are likely due to high carrier mobility, suppressed charge recombination, and fine nanostructure morphology. A 7.74% PCE was achieved from the regular single device based on PBDTFBZS:PC71BM blend film with 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive. In combination with low band gap diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based copolymer, tandem devices based on PBDTFBZS exhibited high PCE up to 9.40%.

The blend of PTFBDT-BZO:PC71BM showed a lower PCE of 5.67% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 9.24 mA/cm(2), and an FF of 0.64. One reason for the lower PCE is probably due to that PTFBDT-BZO has a smaller LUMO offset with PC71BM, which cannot provide enough driving force for charge separation. And another reason is probably due to that PTFBDT-BZO has a lower hole mobility in comparison with PTFBDT-BZS."

An innovative transformation from an aryl ketone group to an aryl ester group was applied to construct the ladder-type molecular skeleton, and the overall synthetic yield toward the donor unit has been significantly improved by choosing aryl side chains instead of aliphatic ones to avoid competing dehydration reactions.

The polymers with longer alkyl chains are sufficiently soluble to be compatible with the processes required to manufacture solar cells. In conventional solar cell devices, polymers with all branched alkyl chains tend to form a higher proportion of a well-ordered face-on crystallite in the π-stack direction than those with both linear and branched alkyl chains, which significantly improves the fill factor (FF), resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). In terms of optimizing the alkyl chain lengths, the installation of longer alkyl side chains on the polymer backbone leads to low molecular weight polymer, which may promote a large phase separation. As a result, the polymers 12OD and BOBO, bearing shorter alkyl groups, performed better, and a BOBO polymer-based solar cell (PSC) ..."

159,10.1021/ja500935d,2014,Tailored donor-acceptor polymers with an A-D1-A-D2 structure: controlling intermolecular interactions to enable enhanced polymer photovoltaic devices.,"Extensive efforts have been made to develop novel conjugated polymers that give improved performance in organic photovoltaic devices. The use of polymers based on alternating electron-donating and electron-accepting units not only allows the frontier molecular orbitals to be tuned to maximize the open-circuit voltage of the devices but also controls the optical band gap to increase the number of photons absorbed and thus modifies the other critical device parameter-the short circuit current. In fact, varying the nonchromophoric components of a polymer is often secondary to the efforts to adjust the intermolecular aggregates and improve the charge-carrier mobility. Here, we introduce an approach to polymer synthesis that facilitates simultaneous control over both the structural and electronic properties of the polymers. Through the use of a tailored multicomponent acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) intermediate, polymers with the unique structure A-D1-A-D2 can be prepared. This approach enables variations in the donor fragment substituents such that control over both the polymer regiochemistry and solubility is possible. This control results in improved intermolecular π-stacking interactions and therefore enhanced charge-carrier mobility. Solar cells using the A-D1-A-D2 structural polymer show short-circuit current densities that are twice that of the simple, random analogue while still maintaining an identical open-circuit voltage. The key finding of this work is that polymers with an A-D1-A-D2 structure offer significant performance benefits over both regioregular and random A-D polymers. The chemical synthesis approach that enables the preparation of A-D1-A-D2 polymers therefore represents a promising new route to materials for high-efficiency organic photovoltaic devices."
160,10.1002/anie.201103313,2011,Replacing alkoxy groups with alkylthienyl groups: a feasible approach to improve the properties of photovoltaic polymers.,"Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention because of their potential application in flexible, light-weight, and low-cost large-area devices through roll-to-roll printing. The bulk heterojunction PSCs showed advanced features in realizing high efficiencies and solution-processible devices. The active layer in this kind of device consists of an interpenetrating network formed by an electron-donor material blended with an electron-acceptor material. 3] Typically, conjugated polymers are used as electron donors and fullerene derivatives are used as the electron acceptors in the PSCs. Recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 6–7% have been realized by using new conjugated polymer donors or new fullerene-derived acceptors. Short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factors (FF) are key parameters for a PSC device, because the PCE of the device is proportional to the values of the three parameters. To broaden the response wavelength range of a PSC device by using conjugated side chains or narrowband-gap conjugated polymers is an effective way to realize high Jsc values. Conjugated polymers with lower HOMO levels are helpful in realizing high Voc and PCE values, as the Voc value of PSCs is directly proportional to the offset between the HOMO level of electron donor and the LUMO level of electron acceptor. PSiFDTBT, PFDTBT, and PCDTBT are three excellent examples for this concept. Consequently, by using conjugated polymers with lower HOMO levels and also narrow band gaps, high PCEs were realized in different families of conjugated polymers. Conjugated polymers based on benzo[1,2-b :4,5-b’]dithiophene (BDT) units have attracted interest as electron donors in the PSC field in recent years, since the report of Hou and Yang et al. on the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of a series of copolymers based on BDT. Many copolymers of BDT with different conjugated units, such as thieno[3,4b]thiophene (TT), 4,7-dithiophene-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), and bithiazole, etc. were synthesized, and the copolymers showed promising photovoltaic properties. In these BDT-based polymers, the alternative copolymers of BDT and TT, namely PBDTTTs, are an important family of photovoltaic materials. For additional improvements in the photovoltaic performance of the PBDTTTs, structural modifications brought about by using different substituents on BDT, or the copolymerized moieties is of great importance. For example, Liang et al. introduced a fluorine atom into the TT unit of the PBDTTTs, and the HOMO level of the resulting polymer was successfully lowered by approximately 0.12 eV, and thus a higher Voc value was achieved, resulting in a great improvement of PCE. Hou et al. optimized PBDTTTs further by replacing the alkoxycarbonyl group on the TT unit with the alkylcarbonyl groups. The structural modification can also be carried out on the BDT units. In this work, we designed an 5-alkylthiophene-2-yl-substituted BDT monomer and synthesized two new PBDTTT-based polymers having either the thienylsubstituted BDT with alkoxycarbonyl-substituted thieno[3,4b]thiophene (TT-E) or the alkylcarbonyl-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT-C); that is PBDTTT-E-Tand PBDTTTC-T, respectively (Scheme 1). To fully investigate the effect of the thienyl-substituted BDTon the photovoltaic properties of the polymers, two corresponding PBDTTT polymers based on the alkoxy-substituted BDT (BDT-O), PBDTTT-E and PBDTTT-C (Scheme 1), were also prepared. The synthetic route of the thienyl-substituted BDT monomer (BDT-T) is shown in Scheme 1. The branched alkyl group 2-ethylhexyl was employed as the side chain on the thiophene to guarantee high solubility of the target polymers. The TT-E and TT-C monomers are commercially available. The polymers were prepared through a Stille coupling reaction between the bis(trimethyltin) BDT monomers (BDT-T and BDT-O) and the bromides (TT-E and TTC) as shown in Scheme 1. All the polymers are soluble in chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers. We found that the two-dimentional (2D) conjugated polymers based on alkylthienyl-substituted BDTs are much more stable than their analogues, the alkoxy-substituted BDTs. The TGA plots of these four polymers are shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that the decomposition temperatures [*] Dr. L. Huo, S. Zhang, F. Xu, Prof. J.

To investigate the influence of side chains on photovoltaic properties, two conjugated polymers with benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (BDT) and 4,7-dithiophen-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) units, Z3 and Z4, were designed and synthesized. These two polymers have identical conjugated main chains and very similar side chains. In polymer Z3, hexyl groups are linked to the thiophene units directly, and in polymer Z4, hexyloxy groups are linked to the thiophene units. Since the hexyloxy group exhibits a smaller steric hindrance and a stronger electron donating effect than the hexyl group, properties of Z3 and Z4 are very different. The hole mobility of the Z3:PCBM blend film is 1.84 × 10−7 cm2/(V s), which is 2 orders lower than that of the Z4:PCBM blend, and photovoltaic results demonstrate that the fill factor (FF) of the Z3-based device is 0.37, while that of the Z4-based polymer solar cell (PSC) device reached 0.61.

PBB3 showed a broad absorbance in the near-IR region with a substantially red-shifted (by more than 100 nm) λ(max) at 790 nm as compared to the PTB series of polymers, which have been previously reported. The PBB3 polymer also showed both a favorable energy level match with PCBM (with a LUMO energy level of -3.29 eV) and a favorable film domain morphology as evidenced by TEM images. Despite these seemingly optimal parameters, a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic device fabricated from a blend of PBB3 and PC(71)BM showed an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 2.04% under AM 1.5G/100 mW cm(-2). The transient absorption spectra of PBB3 showed the absence of cationic and pseudo charge transfer states that were observed previously in the PTB series polymers, which were also composed of alternating thienothiophene (TT) and BDT units. We compared the spectral features and electronic density distribution of PBB3 with those of PTB2, PTB7, and PTBF2. While PTB2 and PTB7 have substantial charge transfer characteristics and also relatively large local internal dipoles through BDT to TT moieties, PTBF2 and PBB3 have minimized internal dipole moments due to the presence of two adjacent TT units (or two opposing fluorine atoms in PTBF2) with opposite orientations or internal dipoles. PBB3 showed a long-lived excitonic state and the slowest electron transfer dynamics of the series of polymers, as well as the fastest recombination rate of the charge-separated (CS) species, indicating that electrons and holes are more tightly bound in these species. Consequently, substantially lower degrees of charge separation were observed in both PBB3 and PTBF2. These results show that not only the energetics but also the internal dipole moment along the polymer chain may be critical in maintaining the pseudocharge transfer characteristics of these systems, which were shown to be partially responsible for the high PCE device made from the PTB series of low band gap copolymers."

This new TID unit is identical to the well‐known thieno[3,4‐c]pyrrole‐4,6‐dione (TPD) unit except that one carbonyl has been replaced by a sulfonyl group. Semi‐empirical calculations on the local dipole moment change between ground and excited states (Δμge) in the repeating units of the new polymer indicate that the replacement of the carbonyl by a sulfonyl group leads to larger Δμge values. The resulting polymers exhibit a diminished power‐conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with PC71BM as an acceptor, which extends the correlation between PCE and Δμge of single repeating units in p‐type polymers to a new regime. Detailed studies show that the strongly electron‐withdrawing sulfonyl group is detrimental to charge separation in alternating copolymers containing a TID unit."

Through experiment and DFT calculations, good correlation is identified between the withdrawing strength of the acceptor group, the HOMO and LUMO levels, and the degree of orbital localization, which allows reliable design principles for CPs. Increasing the acceptor strength results in an enhanced charge transfer upon combination with a donor monomer and a more pronounced decrease of the LUMO level. Moreover, while HOMO states remain delocalized along the polymer chain, LUMO states are strongly localized at specific bonds within the acceptor group. The degree of LUMO localization increases with increasing polymer length, which results in a further drop of the LUMO level and converges to its final value when the number of repeat units reaches the characteristic conjugation length. Based on these insights we designed PBT8PT, which exhibits 6.78% power conversion efficiency after device optimization via the additive assisted annealing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our predictive design approach."

215,10.1039/C3TC32087A,2014,Influence of fluorine substituents on the film dielectric constant and open-circuit voltage in organic photovoltaics,"Conjugated polymers with fluorine substituents on their backbone have exhibited improved performance over their un-fluorinated analogues by lowering the polymer HOMO level, thereby increasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC). To further investigate how fluorine substituents improve device performance, three polymers with the same donor and acceptor co-monomers, but differing by the number of fluorine atoms on the acceptor unit, were synthesized. Although the HOMO levels of the mono-(P1F) and di-fluorinated (P2F) polymers are essentially the same, an increase in VOC was still observed in the OPV device incorporating P2F. This implies that correlating the VOC to the donor polymer HOMO level is inadequate to fully explain the improvement in VOC. By calculating the charge transfer exciton binding energy from the measured film dielectric constant, it was found that the increase in VOC in going from P1F to P2F matches the decrease in charge transfer exciton binding energy."

All the four copolymers have an identical conjugated backbone comprising benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor unit and quinoxaline (Qx) acceptor unit, but with varying conjugated side chains, p-alkoxyphenyl or 2-alkylthienyl, attached to the donor and acceptor units, respectively. As evidenced by UV/Vis absorption spectra, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry, density functional theory (DFT), grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and photovoltaic measurements, the difference in conjugated side chain modulation led to totally different physicochemical properties. Among the four copolymers, PBDT-DFQX-TT exhibits the broadest absorption spectrum, the most close-packed structure as well as a finest fibril structure when blended with PC71BM. After systematic device optimization, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices based on the blends of PBDT-DFQX-PP, PBDT-DFQX-TP, PBDT-DFQX-PT and PBDT-DFQX-TT with PC71BM achieved 3.96%, 6.08%, 6.54% and 7.68%, respectively. By systematic varying the side chains of the copolymers from all phenyl groups to all thienyl ones, PCEs was increased by 250% from 3.96% to 7.68%. To date, PBDT-DFQX-TT is one of a few Qx-based PSCs that exhibits PCE exceeding 7.5%, and the results suggest that simultaneously modulating the conjugated side chains on both donor and acceptor units of copolymers could be an effective strategy for constructing high performance photovoltaic copolymers."

218,10.1039/C5TA05096K,2015,Side chain modification: an effective approach to modulate the energy level of benzodithiophene based polymers for high-performance solar cells,"Over the past few years, it has been proven that deepening the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of conjugated polymers is one of the most successful strategies to develop novel materials for high performance bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. Here we report an effective approach of side chain modification in a donor moiety to modulate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based two-dimensional conjugated polymers and hence obtain improved power conversion efficiency. Through the introduction of 2,3-dioctylthienyl groups instead of conventional 2-ethylhexylthienyl groups as side chains in the 4,8-positions of the BDT moiety, four mono-fluorinated quinoxaline based alternating polymers: poly{4,8-di(2-ethylhexylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(3′′-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTQ-EH), poly{4,8-di(2-ethylhexythiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(5′′-octylthiophen-2′′-yl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTTQ-EH), poly{4,8-di(2,3-dioctylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis-(3′′-octyloxyphenyl)-quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTQ-DO) and poly{4,8-di(2,3-dioctylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(5′′-octylthiophen-2′′-yl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTTQ-DO) were synthesized, in which the former two EH-based polymers contain the 2-ethylhexylthienyl side chain and the latter two DO-based polymers contain the 2,3-dioctylthienyl side chain. The results clearly indicated that the variation in the side chain of the BDT unit from the 2-ethylhexylthienyl group to the 2,3-dioctylthienyl group can cause a deep HOMO level and slightly enlarged bandgap of the polymer. Consequently, polymer solar cells from PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO showed high Vocs of 0.88 V and 0.85 V, while those of 0.78 V and 0.72 V were observed in PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH based devices, respectively. Both polymers deliver high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 6.8%, with an outstanding efficiency of 7.61% and an excellent fill factor (FF) of 75.9% for PBDTTFTQ-DO after tetrahydrofuran solvent vapour annealing for 30 s (while a PCE of 7.29% for PBDTTFTQ-EH). Similar results were investigated in PBDTTFTTQ-EH (a PCE of 6.82%) and PBDTTFTTQ-DO (a PCE of 7.25% with high FF of 75.7%) based solar cells. This finding should provide valuable guidelines for the design and synthesis of novel polymer donor materials for highly efficient polymer solar cells via fine tuning of the molecular energy levels and absorption spectra through a modulation of the side chain onto the donor moiety."

Side chain substitution on the PQD unit leads to good solubility which enables very high molecular weight copolymers to be attained. The fusion of two strong electron-withdrawing groups (Qx and dicarboxylic imide) makes the PQD unit a stronger electron-deficient moiety than if the unit had just one electron-withdrawing group, thus enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer between electron-rich and deficient units of the copolymer. Four PQD-based polymers were synthesized which feature deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels and bathochromic absorption spectra when compared to PBDT-Qx and PBDT-TPD analogues. The copolymers incorporated with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT) units show that the 1D and 2D structural variations of the side groups on the BDT unit are correlated with the device performance. As a result, the corresponding solar cells (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer: PC71BM/LiF/Al) based on the four copolymers feature very high open-circuit voltages (V-oc) of around 1.0 V. The copolymer PBDT-PQD1 attains the best power conversion efficiency of 4.9%, owing to its relatively high absorption intensity and suitable film morphology. The structure-property correlation demonstrates that the new PQD unit is a promising electron-deficient building block for efficient photovoltaic materials with high V-oc."

The impact of side-chain variations on the photothermal stability of solar cells containing poly(benzodithiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole) polymers are investigated in the absence of oxygen. Four different side-chains of benzodithiophene (BDT) are synthesized and copolymerized with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) by Stille polymerization.

PEDOT
PSS as transport layers (ITO/ZnO/active layer/


PEDOT
PSS/Ag). Device degradation is correlated to the morphological behavior of the polymer:blend upon AM1.5 illumination (UV-visible light, 50 °C) and have been investigated by AFM, XRD, and UV-Vis. Once exposed to the light and to the temperature the BHJ stability is governed by two processes (i) PCBM crystallization and (ii) PCBM dimerization. Dimerization results in a rapid initial performance decrease followed by a more gradual decrease caused by a slower thermally activated crystallization. Depending on the blend morphology, dictated by the polymer's alkyl chain, the two processes occur to different extents thereby modulating the BHJ stability. Thus, of the polymer side-chains explored, linear alkyl side-chains stabilized the bulk heterojunction most effectively followed by no side-chain, alkoxy and branched side-chains. Lowering the concentration of fullerene in the active layer also reduces the rate of degradation across the polymers tested. This is a result of both the rate of crystallization and dimerization of fullerene being dependent on its concentration and the nature of the polymer side-chains. This approach appears to be a general strategy to increase the polymer:PCBM stability."

For this, we designed two donor (D)–acceptor (A) polymers, represented as PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, containing alkoxy-BPA(H) and alkoxy-BPA(F) [BPA = biphenylethynyl] on the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit as novel CSCs, respectively. The introduction of these CSCs generated bis-tolane as an integrated part of the BDT unit, which allowed us to address the difference in the polymerization, photophysical, and photovoltaic properties of PBDTBPA(H)-DPP and PBDTBPA(F)-DPP, as a function of the structural variation of CSCs, which has never been investigated in organic solar cells (OSCs). In contrast to the weak electron-donating nature of BPA(H), BPA(F) exhibited a strong electron-donating ability due to the interaction of the lone pair electrons of the fluorine atom with the triple bond via resonance, which decreased the rigidity of the triple bond, whereas in PBDTBPA(H)-DPP the rigidity of the triple bond was retained with no such interaction. The striking differences in the rigidity and different electron-withdrawing tendencies of the CSCs were well correlated with Mw and with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the polymers. As a result, the inverted OSCs based on PBDTBPA(H)-DPP achieved an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.58%, which was 38% higher than that of PBDTBPA(F)-DPP-based inverted OSCs. More significantly, the inverted OSC devices were highly stable, retaining 80% of their original PCE after 60-day storage in air, even without encapsulation. To the best of our knowledge, this 5.58% is the highest PCE reported to date for the arylethynyl-substituted BDT donor-based OSCs.

The monomer was copolymerized with bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDT) and N-9′-heptadecanylcarbazole (CB) donors to obtain donor–acceptor alternating copolymers poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-3,6-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-bis[4-(4′-cyanobiphenyloxy)dodecyl]-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PBDTDPPcbp) and poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-bis[4-(4′-cyano-biphenyloxy)dodecyl]-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3, 4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPPcpb) with reduced band gap, respectively. The LC properties of the copolymers, the effects of main chain variation on molecular packing, optical properties, and energy levels were analyzed. Incorporating the mesogen cyanobiphenyl units not only help polymer donors to pack well through mesogen self-organization but also push the fullerene acceptor to form optimized phase separation. The bulk heterojunction photovoltaicdevicesshow enhanced performance of 1.3% for PBDTDPPcbp and 1.2% for PCBTDPPcbp after thermal annealing.

226,10.1021/jacs.5b08556,2015,Terthiophene-based D-A polymer with an asymmetric arrangement of alkyl chains that enables efficient polymer solar cells.,"We report a series of difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) and oligothiophene-based polymers with the oligothiophene unit being quaterthiophene (T4), terthiophene (T3), and bithiophene (T2). We demonstrate that a polymer based on ffBT and T3 with an asymmetric arrangement of alkyl chains enables the fabrication of 10.7% efficiency thick-film polymer solar cells (PSCs) without using any processing additives. By decreasing the number of thiophene rings per repeating unit and thus increasing the effective density of the ffBT unit in the polymer backbone, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the T3 polymers are significantly deeper than those of the T4 polymers, and the absorption onset of the T3 polymers is also slightly red-shifted. For the three T3 polymers obtained, the positions and size of the alkyl chains play a critical role in achieving the best PSC performances. The T3 polymer with a commonly known arrangement of alkyl chains (alkyl chains sitting on the first and third thiophenes in a mirror symmetric manner) yields poor morphology and PSC efficiencies. Surprisingly, a T3 polymer with an asymmetric arrangement of alkyl chains (which is later described as having an ""asymmetric bi-repeating unit"") enables the best-performing PSCs. Morphological studies show that the optimized ffBT-T3 polymer forms a polymer:fullerene morphology that differs significantly from that obtained with T4-based polymers. The morphological changes include a reduced domain size and a reduced extent of polymer crystallinity. The change from T4 to T3 comonomer units and the novel arrangement of alkyl chains in our study provide an important tool to tune the energy levels and morphological properties of donor polymers, which has an overall beneficial effect and leads to enhanced PSC performance."

This often results in a trade-off between solubility and self-organizing behavior; however, each material has specific optimal chains. Here we report on the effect of alkyl side chains on the film morphologies, crystallinities, and optoelectronic properties of new benzobisthiazole-naphthobisthiadiazole (PBBT-NTz) polymers. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of linear-branched and all-branched polymers range from 2.5% to 6.6%; the variations in these PCEs are investigated by atomic force microscopy, two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD), and transient photoconductivity techniques. The best-performing linear-branched polymer, bearing dodecyl and decyltetradecyl chains (C12-DT), exhibits nanometer-scale fibers along with the highest crystallinity, comprising predominant edge-on and partial face-on orientations. This morphology leads to the highest photoconductivity and the longest carrier lifetime. These results highlight the importance of long alkyl chains for inducing intermolecular stacking, which is in contrast to observations made for analogous previously reported polymers."

The synthetic modification of an isoindigo related building block based on rational design has been carried out in this study. An expanded isoindigo unit (IBTI) with 5,5′-divinyl-2,2′-bithiophene as a conjugated bridge has been successfully incorporated into a donor–acceptor conjugated polymer, PBDT–IBTI. The new polymer showed broad absorption and a large extinction coefficient in the visible region. The optical bandgap, HOMO and LUMO levels of this new polymer are 1.71 eV, −5.24 eV and −3.72 eV, respectively. The polymer solar cells based on PBDT–IBTI and (6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) blends achieved a PCE of 6.41%.

Results have demonstrated that the use of bithiophene as a spacer unit improves the geometry of the polymer chain, making it planar, and hence, potentially enhanced π- π stacking occurs. Due to favorable interaction of the polymer chains, enhanced absorption coefficient, and optimal morphology, PBDT-BTI, which possesses bithiophene as a spacer, revealed high current and fill factor leading to a power conversion efficiency of 7.3% in devices, making this polymer the best performing isoindigo-based material in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Also, PBDT-BTI could still maintain efficiency of over 6% with the active layer thickness of 270 nm, making it a potential candidate for a material in printed PSCs. These results demonstrate that the use of thiophene spacers in D-A polymers could be an important design strategy to produce high-performance PSCs."

We discover that the optical absorption, frontier orbitals, backbone coplanarity, molecular orientation, solubility, film morphology, charge carrier mobility, and solar cell performance are critically influenced by the heteroarenes in the acceptor subunits.

The effects of syn- and anti-repeating units on optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of polymers were investigated. The anti-PBDFID displayed lower optical bandgap and higher HOMO energy level than syn-PBDFID. The syn-PBDFID had better solubility than anti-PBDFID. The energy levels of two new polymers were compared with some related benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes (BDTs) based polymers. The results suggested that the utilization of less conjugated repeating units such as syn-BDF and the elimination of electron donating groups on the central phenyl ring of BDF can effectively lower the HOMO energy level of polymer. The low HOMO energy level of syn-PBDFID enabled high open circuit voltages in PSC devices."

The alkyl chains on the diketopyrrolopyrrole monomers were varied to engineer the solubility and morphology of the materials. Thiophene and furan moieties were used to flank the DPP group and the impact of these heterocycles on the polymers' properties evaluated. All of the polymers have similar optoelectronic properties with optical band-gaps of 1.3–1.4 eV, LUMO levels of −3.7 to −3.8 eV and HOMO levels of −5.5 to −5.6 eV. The furan-containing polymers have better solubility than the all-thiophene polymers, as significantly higher molecular weight materials of the former were readily dissolved. When the polymers were used as donor materials along with PC71BM as the electron-acceptor in bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells, power conversion efficiencies of up to 2.9% were obtained, with the furan-containing polymers giving the best results."
237,10.1039/C3PY00074E,2013,Benzodifuran-alt-thienothiophene based low band gap copolymers: substituent effects on their molecular energy levels and photovoltaic properties,"A series of low band gap photovoltaic copolymers containing benzodifuran-alt-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (BDF-alt-TT) were designed and synthesized. Functional groups with different electron-withdrawing abilities such as carbonyl, ester, fluorine, sulfuryl and cyano were introduced to the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit to finely tune the molecular energy levels of these copolymers. All these copolymers are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) to evaluate the effects of these electron-deficient functional groups. According to their electrochemical behaviours, the electron-deficient abilities of these functional groups can be arranged in the order carbonyl < fluorine + ester < fluorine + carbonyl < sulfuryl < cyano + ester. It was found the sulfuryl group and cyano substituted copolymers show blue-shift in absorption spectra compared to the other three copolymers, indicating that sulfuryl and cyano groups may cause stronger steric hindrance to the conjugated backbones. The photovoltaic properties of these copolymers were also investigated by making polymer solar cell (PSC) devices. Interestingly, although the copolymers have different molecular structures, the optimal D/A (polymer/PC71BM, wt/wt) ratios of all of the devices are 1 : 1.5. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was used to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices. The champion efficiency of 5.23% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.63 V was achieved from PBDFTT-CF/PC71BM based devices. The device based on the cyano-substituted copolymer, PBDFTT-ECN, shows a rather high Voc of 0.87 V, but the short current density (Jsc) is significant lower than the device based on PBDFTT-CF, and its seems that the offset between the LUMO levels of PBDFTT-ECN and PC71BM is too small to achieve efficient charge separation. In conclusion, the molecular energy level of the copolymers with the alternating aromatic–quinoid (A–Q) structure, BDF-alt-TT, can be tuned effectively by introducing electron-deficient groups. Furthermore, according to the photovoltaic results of PBDFTT-S and PBDFTT-CNF, a LUMO level of −3.70 eV may reach the threshold of getting efficient charge separation of the polymer/PC71BM blend."

These two polymers have the same backbones and different side groups. Although these two polymers show similar optical band gaps (ca. 1.5 eV), the polymer with alkylthienyl side groups, PBDFTT-CF-T, exhibits stronger absorption in long wavelength direction than the polymer with alkoxyl side groups, PBDFTT-CF-O. Meanwhile, PBDFTT-CF-T exhibits a HOMO level of −5.21 eV, which is 0.23 eV lower than that of PBDFTT-CF-O due to weaker electron-donating ability of alkylthienyl side groups than that of aloxyl side groups. The hole mobility of the blend of PBDFTT-CF-T/PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) is 0.128 cm2 V–1 s–1, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the blend of PBDFTT-CF-O/PC71BM.

In particular, we show that the BDF-based derivatives can achieve up to ca. 7.4% PCE in thin-fi lm devices with mixed polymer orientations, and with no evidence for π–π stacking interactions within the BHJ. The solid-state NMR (SSNMR) analyses of the neat PBDFTPD polymer points to distinct backbone correlations compared to its PBDTTPD counterpart. Following our general protocol for the synthesis of PBDTTPD polymers, [ 3c ] we fi rst considered preparing the BDFbased polymer analogs using standard Schlenk line techniques (see details in SI). Recent studies have used similar protocols for the polymerization of several BDF derivatives. [ 6 ] However, our attempts to prepare the n -octyl(C8)-substituted TPD-based polymer analog – PBDFTPD(2EH/C8) – quickly led to the precipitation of residues of low solubility in the polymerization solvent (chlorobenzene, CB), whereas, following the same experimental conditions, PBDTTPD(2EH/C8) can be polymerized in high yields and molecular weights (MWs). [ 3a , 3c ] In order to better control polymer growth and MW, while minimizing reaction times, we turned to a microwave-assisted approach (see SI). Here, PBDFTPD(2EH/C8) was polymerized at 150 °C for 1 h (150 W), and, being found soluble, the resulting polymer was purifi ed using established methods. [ 3a , 3c ] A batch of PBDTTPD(2EH/C8) of comparable MW (see SI, Table S1) was polymerized following the same conditions to serve as a model polymer in this study; the thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses of the polymers are shown in the SI (Figure S2). Comparing the spectral absorption of the two polymers (Figure 1 b), the early absorption onset of PBDFTPD(2EH/C8) is consistent with the larger ionization potential (IP) of the polymer measured by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA): 5.41 eV vs. 5.29 eV for its counterpart PBDTTPD(2EH/C8) (Figure 1 c). In turn, PBDFTPD(2EH/C8) is a higher-bandgap material: 1.97 eV vs. 1.85 eV for the model polymer. Thin-fi lm BHJ solar cells with the standard confi guration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDXTPD:PC 71 BM/Ca/Al were fabricated and tested under AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm – 2 ). The cells with optimized PBDXTPD:PC 71 BM blend ratios (1:1.5, wt/wt) were cast from chlorobenzene (CB); similar device fabrication and optimization procedures were used for all of the PBDXTPD derivatives (see SI). As shown in Table 1 , “as-cast” solar cells fabricated from PBDFTPD(2EH/C8) achieved PCEs of ca. 7% (max.: 7.4%), combining a high fi ll-factor (FF) of 68%, and a large V OC of 0.97V. In comparison, devices cast from the model polymer PBDTTPD(2EH/C8) achieved slightly lower PCEs (Avg.: 6.6%; max.: 7.0%), mainly due to slightly lower V OC (0.94V) and FF With recently reported power conversion effi ciencies (PCE) >9% in tandem and triple-junction solar cells, [ 1 ] π-conjugated polymer donors with tunable bandgaps are proving especially promising in bulk-heterojunctions (BHJ) with phenyl-C61/71butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) acceptors. [ 2 ] Among these, benzo[1,2b :4,5b' ]dithiophene–thieno[3,4c ]pyrrole-4,6-dione polymers (PBDTTPD, Figure 1 a) have been shown to yield some of the highest open-circuit voltages ( V OC , ca. 0.9 V) and fi ll-factors (FF, ca. 70%) in conventional BHJ devices (singlecell). [ 3 ] In PBDTTPD, side-chains of various size and branching impact polymer self-assembly, spanning molecular packing distances, [ 3a ] degree of nanostructural order [ 3a ] and backbone orientation in thin-fi lms. [ 3c ] In recent work correlating these structural variations with solar cell effi ciency, various PBDTTPD derivatives were found to achieve PCEs ranging from 4% to ca. 8.5%. [ 3a , 3c ] These fi gures of merit make PBDTTPD an outstanding candidate for use in the high-bandgap cell of multiplejunction solar cells. While setting the HOMO of the polymer and governing the V OC of the BHJ with PCBM, various donor motifs (e.g. furan vs . thiophene) can also be used to control polymer solubility in processing solvents. [ 4 ] In parallel, polymer systems made from analogous donor motifs may show distinct self-assembling properties in thin-fi lms. [ 5 ] In PBDTTPD polymers, the BDT donors set a low-lying HOMO of ca. 5.3 eV, which contributes toward the high V OC values >0.9 V obtained in BHJ solar cells with PCBM.

PDPPDTT, which incorporated a dithienothiophene (DTT), showed a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.11% compared to 3.31% for the BDT-based polymer (PDPPBDT). PDPPDTBDT, which incorporated a dithienobenzodithiophene (DTBDT), also exhibited superior performance, with a PCE of 4.75% although this value was lower than that obtained for PDPPDTT. The presence of the DTT unit in the polymer backbone lowered the energy bandgap of the polymer and induced an optimal morphology in the polymer:PC71BM blend film, resulting in higher charge carrier generation. Furthermore, the effectively delocalized frontier orbitals of PDPPDTT enhanced intermolecular interactions between the polymer chains by favoring effective π–π stacking, which facilitated charge carrier transport. By contrast, PDPPDTBDT unexpectedly showed a low-crystallinity thi..."

We describe the synthesis of DTBT monomers with either 0, 1, or 2 cyano groups on the BT unit and their corresponding copolymers with the electron rich donor dithienogermole (DTG). The presence of the cyano group is found to have a strong influence on the optoelectronic properties of the resulting donor–acceptor polymers, with the optical band gap red-shifting by approximately 0.15 eV per cyano substituent. We find that the polymer electron affinity is significantly increased by ∼0.25 eV upon addition of each cyano group, while the ionization potential is less strongly affected, increasing by less than 0.1 eV per cyano substituent. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices power conversion efficiencies (PCE) are almost doubled from around 3.5% for the unsubstituted BT polymer to over 6.5% for the monocyano substituted BT polymer.

These materials were designed for use in organic photovoltaic (OPV) and organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices. While the DPP conjugated unit was held constant for each of the materials, the alternating unit of the copolymer was varied from thiophene (TTT), to phenyl (TPT), to 3,4-difluorothiophene (TTfT), to 2,5-difluorophenyl (TPfT) creating a series of DPP materials that can be used to study structure–property-performance relationships. Molecular weights (Mw) of 17–110 kg/mol were achieved by DArP and the resulting polymers displayed excellent optical and electrical properties, comparable to previous reports of similar materials synthesized by Stille or Suzuki polycondensation.

This article introduces results obtained on copolymers of isoindigo with thiophene and alkylated terthiophenes to highlight fundamental characteristics in isoindigo-based polymers and the resulting organic field-effect transistors and photovoltaic devices.

We report the synthesis of three highly photostable polymers (PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF2) and their suitability for use in high-performance OPV cells. Under 1 sunlight of illumination in air for 10 h, these polymer films demonstrated remarkably high photostability compared to that of PTB7, a representative polymer in the OPV field. While the PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF2 polymer films maintained 97, 90, and 96% photostability, respectively, a PTB7 film exhibited only 38% photostability under the same conditions. We ascribed the high photostability of the polymers to both the intrinsically photostable chemical moieties and the dense packing of alkyl side chains and planar backbone polymer chains, which prevents oxygen diffusion into the PDTBDT-BZ films.

Although both polymers have shown similar optical band gaps and frontier energy levels, regardless of the introduction of vinylene bridge, the introduction of a π-extended vinylene group in the polymer backbone substantially enhances the charge transport characteristics of the resulting polymer due to its strong tendency to self-assemble and thus to enhance the crystallinity. An analysis on charge recombination in the active layer of a solar cell device indicates that the outstanding charge transport (μ = 1.90 cm(2)·V(-1)·s(-1)) of PTVTPD with a vinylene group effectively suppresses the bimolecular recombination, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 7.16%, which is 20% higher than that (5.98%) of the counterpart polymer without a vinylene group (PBTTPD). More importantly, PTVTPD-based devices do not show a large variation of photovoltaic performance with the active layer thickness; that is, the PCE remains at 6% as the active layer thickness increases up to 450 nm, demonstrating that the PTVTPD-based solar cell is very compatible with industrial processing."

This approach can simultaneously lead to deepening the HOMO and LUMO of the polymers with moderate energy offset against fullerene derivatives in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics. As a proof‐of‐concept, BBTz‐based random copolymers conjugated with typical electron acceptors: thienopyrroledione (TPD) and benzothiadiazole (BT) based on density functional theory calculations are synthesized. Laser‐flash and Xe‐flash time‐resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) evaluations of polymer:[6,6]‐phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends are conducted to screen the feasibility of the copolymers, leading to optimization of processing conditions for photovoltaic device application. According to the TMRC results, alternating BBTz‐BT copolymers are designed, exhibiting extended photoabsorption up to ca. 750 nm, deep HOMO (–5.5 to –5.7 eV), good miscibility with PCBM, and inherent crystalline nature. Moreover, the maximized PCE of 3.8%, the top‐class among BBTz‐based polymers reported so far, is realized in an inverted cell using TiOx and MoOx as the buffer layers. This study opens up opportunities to create low‐bandgap polymers with deep HOMO, and shows how the device‐less TRMC evaluation is of help for decision‐making on judicious molecular design."

In this paper we detail the synthesis and characterization of two new low-band-gap polythiophenes, poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5′,5′′-diyl] (PCPDTTBTT) and poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,3-dioctylquinoxaline-5,8-diyl] (PCPDTQ), for use in these applications. The PCPDTQ polymer did not produce efficient solar cells. A high power efficiency of 2.1% under one sun was found for a PCPDTTBTT/fullerene mixture. The high efficiency was achieved by alteration of the morphology using a solvent additive. Analysis of atomic force microscopy phase images shows that material phases with distinct mixing ratios are formed and altered with the addition of the solvent additive."

We report a new series of bithiopheneimide-based donor-acceptor copolymers for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs. The bithiopheneimide electron-deficiency compresses polymer bandgaps and lowers the HOMOs--essential to maximize power conversion efficiency (PCE). While the dithiophene bridge progression R(2)Si→R(2)Ge minimally impacts bandgaps, it substantially alters the HOMO energies. Furthermore, imide N-substituent variation has negligible impact on polymer opto-electrical properties, but greatly affects solubility and microstructure. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) indicates that branched N-alkyl substituents increased polymer π-π spacings vs linear N-alkyl substituents, and the dithienosilole-based PBTISi series exhibits more ordered packing than the dithienogermole-based PBTIGe analogues. Further insights into structure-property-device performance correlations are provided by a thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)-dithienosilole copolymer PTPDSi. DFT computation and optical spectroscopy show that the TPD-based polymers achieve greater subunit-subunit coplanarity via intramolecular (thienyl)S···O(carbonyl) interactions, and GIWAXS indicates that PBTISi-C8 has lower lamellar ordering, but closer π-π spacing than does the TPD-based analogue. Inverted BHJ solar cells using bithiopheneimide-based polymer as donor and PC(71)BM as acceptor exhibit promising device performance with PCEs up to 6.41% and V(oc) > 0.80 V. In analogous cells, the TPD analogue exhibits 0.08 V higher V(oc) with an enhanced PCE of 6.83%, mainly attributable to the lower-lying HOMO induced by the higher imide group density. These results demonstrate the potential of BTI-based polymers for high-performance solar cells, and provide generalizable insights into structure-property relationships in TPD, BTI, and related polymer semiconductors."

The new indacenodiselenophene-based polymer (PIDSe-DFBT) possessed improved absorption over its sulfur analogue in films, as well as substantially higher charge mobilities (0.15 and 0.064 cm2/(V s) hole and electron mobility, respectively, compared to 0.002 and 0.008 cm2/(V s) for PIDT-DFBT). The enhanced material properties led to an improved power conversion efficiency of 6.8% in photovoltaic cells, a 13% improvement over PIDT-DFBT-based devices.

To the best of our knowledge, this attractive molecule has never been incorporated into a polymer and thus its application in polymer solar cells has never been explored. For the first time, we report the detailed synthesis of the tetra-alkylated DIDT molecule leading to its dibromo- and diboronic ester derivatives, which are the key monomers for preparation of DIDT-based polymers. Two donor-acceptor alternating polymers, poly(diindenothiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) PDIDTBT and poly(diindenothiophene-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) PDIDTDTBT, were synthesized by using Suzuki polymerization. Copolymer PTDIDTTBT was also prepared by using Stille polymerization. Although PTDIDTTBT is prepared through a manner of random polymerization, we found that the different reactivities of the dibromo-monomers lead to the resulting polymer having a block copolymer arrangement. With the higher structural regularity, PTDIDTTBT, symbolized as (thiophene-alt-DIDT)(0.5)-block-(thiophene-alt-BT)(0.5), shows the higher degree of crystallization, stronger π-π stacking, and broader absorption spectrum in the solid state, as compared to its alternating PDIDTDTBT analogue. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC(71)BM/Ca/Al configuration were fabricated and characterized. PDIDTDTBT/PC(71)BM and PTDIDTTBT/PC(71)BM systems exhibited promising power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 1.65 % and 2.00 %, respectively. Owing to the complementary absorption spectra, as well as the compatible structures of PDIDTDTBT and PTDIDTTBT, the PCE of the device based on the ternary blend PDIDTDTBT/PTDIDTTBT/PC(71)BM was further improved to 2.40 %."

304,10.1002/aenm.201100193,2011,Synthesis and Characterization of a Copolymer Based on Thiazolothiazole and Dithienosilole for Polymer Solar Cells,"Scheme 1 . Molecular structures of PDTSBTz and PDTSTTz . In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, light weight, and the capability to fabricate fl exible large-area devices. [ 1–5 ] The key issue in studies of PSCs is the power conversion effi ciency (PCE) of the devices. The factors that determine the PCE of the PSCs are the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), short-circuit current ( J SC ), and fi ll factor (FF). V OC is limited by the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. [ 6 ] The J SC is closely related to the absorption capacity and charge-carrier mobility of the photovoltaic materials, and the FF is infl uenced by the charge-carrier mobility of the photoactive layer. Higher charge-carrier mobility results in larger J SC and higher FF values. [ 7 ] The photoactive layer of PSCs is commonly composed of a blend of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor such as [6,6]-phenyl-C 60 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 60 BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C 70 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70 BM). Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and PC 60 BM are the most representative donor and acceptor materials, and the PCE values of PSCs based on P3HT/PCBM can reach over 4%. [ 8 ] Nevertheless, the relatively large bandgap and higher-lying HOMO energy level ( − 4.76 eV) [ 9 ] of P3HT signifi cantly limits the J SC and V OC values ( V OC is limited to ca. 0.6 V) of PSCs based on P3HT/ PCBM. In order to improve the visible absorption and decrease the HOMO energy level of conjugated polymers, design and synthesis of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers has been proven to be the most successful strategy. [ 10–17 ] With this strategy, the PCE of the PSCs using new D–A copolymers as donor materials has recently reached up to 6–7%. [ 16 , 17 ]"

309,10.1039/B818885H,2009,Novel NIR-absorbing conjugated polymers for efficient polymer solar cells: effect of alkyl chain length on device performance,"Three low bandgap conjugated polymers, i.e., PDTPBT-C8, PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5, which consist of alternating N-alkyl dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units and carry 1-octylnonyl, 1-hexylheptyl and 1-pentylhexyl as side chains, respectively, were synthesized. These polymers show strong absorption in the wavelength range of 600–900 nm with enhanced absorption coefficient as the length of alkyl chain decreases. The film morphology of the polymers and 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]-C-61 (PCBM) blends is also dependent on the alkyl chain length. As the length decreases, the film becomes more uniform and the domian size decreases from 400–900 nm for PDTPBT-C8 to ∼50 nm for PDTPBT-C5. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated based on the blend of the polymers and PCBM with a weight ratio of 1:3. The device performance is dramatically improved as the length of the side chain decreases, due to enhanced film absorption coefficient and improved film morphology. With the polymer PDTPBT-C5, which carries the shortest alkyl chain, power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 2.80% has been achieved. This result indicates that optimizing the structure of the solublizing alkyl chain is also crucial for the design and synthesis of high performance PSC polymeric materials."

The homopolymer of BDT (HMPBDT) and alternating copolymer of BDT with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (PBDT-BT) were therefore synthesized and fully characterized. Both the homopolymer (HMPBDT) and the copolymer (PBDT-BT) were experimentally confirmed to have low HOMO energy levels (-5.70 eV for HMPBDT and -5.34 eV for PBDT-BT). Introducing the acceptor moiety (2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) successfully lowered the optical band gap of the copolymer from 2.31 eV (HMPBDT) to 1.78 eV (PBDT-BT). Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated from blends of these structurally related polymers with PBCM to investigate the photovoltaic performances. The optimized device of HMPBDT:PCBM (1:3, 180 nm) exhibited an improved open circuit voltage (V(oc)) of 0.76 V, a short circuit current (J(sc)) of 0.34 mA/cm(2), and a fill factor (FF) of 0.40, offering an overall efficiency of 0.10%. The observed large phase separation of the thin film by AFM and the large band gap were accountable for the small current. The optimized device of PBDT-BT:PCBM (1:3, 55 nm) demonstrated a better efficiency of 0.6%, with V(oc) = 0.72 V, J(sc) = 2.06 mA/cm(2), and FF = 0.42. The much improved current was attributed to the lower bandgap and better film morphology. However, the low hole mobility limited the thickness of the PBDT-BT:PCBM film, making inaccessible the thicker film which would utilize more light and enhance the current. Further improvements are expected if the mobility and film morphology can be improved by the new materials design, together with low band gap and low HOMO energy level."

These features have been exploited in the recent examples of benzo[2,1‐b:3,4‐b']dithiophene (BDT)‐based polymers for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaics (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2009, 1, 1613). Taking one step further, a simple oxidative photocyclization is used here to convert the BDT with two pendent thiophene units into an enlarged planar polycyclic aromatic ring—quadrathienonaphthalene (QTN). The reduced steric hindrance and more planar structure promotes the intermolecular interaction of QTN‐based polymers, leading to increased hole mobility in related polymers. As‐synthesized homopolymer (HMPQTN) and donor–acceptor polymer (PQTN‐BT) maintain a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, ascribable to the polycyclic aromatic (QTN) moiety, which leads to a good open‐circuit voltage in BHJ devices of these polymers blended with PCBM ([6,6]‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester; HMPQTN: 0.76 V, PQTN‐BT: 0.72 V). The donor–acceptor polymer (PQTN‐BT) has a smaller optical bandgap (1.6 eV) than that of HMPQTN (2.0 eV), which explains its current (5.69 mA cm−2) being slightly higher than that of HMPQTN (5.02 mA cm−2).

The higher efficiency is attributed to better absorption, higher hole mobility, and the reduced phase separation scale in P3:PC 71 BM blend. The aggregate domain size in P3:PC 71 BM blend is 50 nm, much smaller than that in P2:PC 71 BM blend (200 nm).

Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) results revealed the high solid-state order of P(FBT-alt-Se2Th2) and its edge-on orientation on the substrate. It delivered a high hole mobility (μh) of 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1 in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).

328,10.1021/ja207429s,2011,"3,4-Disubstituted polyalkylthiophenes for high-performance thin-film transistors and photovoltaics.","We demonstrate that poly(3,4-dialkylterthiophenes) (P34ATs) have comparable transistor mobilities (0.17 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) and greater environmental stability (less degradation of on/off ratio) than regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs). Unlike poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), P34ATs do not show a strong and distinct π-π stacking in X-ray diffraction. This suggests that a strong π-π stacking is not always necessary for high charge-carrier mobility and that other potential polymer packing motifs in addition to the edge-on structure (π-π stacking direction parallel to the substrate) can lead to a high carrier mobility. The high charge-carrier mobilities of the hexyl and octyl-substituted P34AT produce power conversion efficiencies of 4.2% in polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices. An enhanced open-circuit voltage (0.716-0.771 eV) in P34AT solar cells relative to P3HT due to increased ionization potentials was observed."

Low bandgap polymers (bandgap = 1.4-1.5 eV) were prepared using BDTT, BDTP, FDPP, and DPP units via Stille-coupling polymerization. These structural modifications lead to polymers with different optical, electrochemical, and electronic properties.

Quantum chemistry calculations based on density functional theory indicated that different substitutions have significant impacts on the planarity and rigidity of the polymer backbones. Interestingly, the alkyloxy chains of PDBPTBT-4 tend to stay in the same plane with the benzothiadiazole unit, but the others appear to be out of plane.

The most promising changes were noticed in optical, electrochemical, and morphological properties upon varying the degree of fluorine atoms on the side chain.

Incorporation of a small amount of 2,5-difluorobenzene unit into the backbone of donor polymers can significantly increase their planarity and crystallinity as well as decrease their solubility. The improved molecular conformation can markedly affect the morphology of polymer:PC71BM blend films. After incorporation of 5 mol % 2,5-difluorobenzene unit into the backbone of donor polymers, the domain size of blend films became smaller and the hole mobility increased.

349,10.1021/acsami.7b04214,2017,The Effect of Fluorine Substitution on the Molecular Interactions and Performance in Polymer Solar Cells.,"Fluorine (F) substitution on conjugated polymers in polymer solar cells (PSCs) has a diverse effect on molecular properties and device performance. We present a series of three D-A type conjugated polymers (PBT, PFBT, and PDFBT) based on dithienothiophene and benzothiadiazole units with different numbers of F atoms to explain the influence of F substitution by comparing the molecular interactions of the polymers and the recombination kinetics in PSCs. The preaggregation behavior of PFBT and PDFBT in o-DCB at the UV-vis absorption spectra proves that both polymers have strong intermolecular interactions. Besides, more closely packed structures and change into face-on orientation of fluorinated polymers are observed in polymer:PC71BM blends by GIXD which is beneficial for charge transport and, ultimately, for current density in PSCs (4.3, 13.0, and 14.5 mA cm-2 for PBT, PFBT, and PDFBT, respectively). Also, the introduction of F atoms on conjugated backbones affects the recombination kinetics by suppressing bimolecular recombination, thereby improving the fill factor (0.41, 0.68, and 0.69 for PBT, PFBT, and PDFBT, respectively). Consequently, the PCE of PSCs reached 7.3% without any additional treatment (annealing, solvent additive, etc.) in the polymer containing difluorinated BT (PDFBT) that is much higher than nonfluorinated BT (PBT ∼ 1%) and monofluorinated BT (PFBT ∼ 6%)."

The incorporation of the third component, 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole, makes the side chains discretely distributed in the polymer backbones, which can enhance the π-π stacking of polymers in film, markedly increase the hole mobility of active layers, and improve the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices. Influence of the third component on the morphology of active layer was also studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments. P1-1/PC71BM-based PSCs gave a high PCE up to 7.25%, whereas similarly fabricated devices for P1-0/PC71BM only showed a PCE of 3.46%. The PCE of P1-1/PC71BM-based device was further enhanced to 8.79% after the use of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive. Most importantly, after the incorporation of 10% 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole unit, P1-1 exhibited a marked tolerance to the blend film thickness. Devices with a thickness of 265 nm still showed a PCE above 8%, indicating that P1-1 is promising for future applications."
351,10.1002/aenm.201600148,2016,Low Band Gap Polymer Solar Cells With Minimal Voltage Losses,"One of the factors limiting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) is their large energy losses (E loss) in the conversion from photons to electrons, typically believed to be around 0.6 eV and often higher than those of inorganic solar cells. In this work, a novel low band gap polymer PIDTT‐TID with a optical gap of 1.49 eV is synthesized and used as the donor combined with PC71BM in solar cells. These solar cells attain a good power conversion efficiency of 6.7% with a high open‐circuit voltage of 1.0 V, leading to the E loss as low as 0.49 eV. A systematic study indicates that the driving force in this donor and acceptor system is sufficient for charge generation with the low E loss.

353,10.1002/aenm.201601138,2017,Control of Mesoscale Morphology and Photovoltaic Performance in Diketopyrrolopyrrole‐Based Small Band Gap Terpolymers,"Morphology control is one of the key strategies in optimizing the performance of organic photovoltaic materials, particularly for diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)‐based donor polymers. The design of DPP‐based polymers that provide high power conversion efficiency (PCE) presents a significant challenge that requires optimization of both energetics and morphology. Herein, a series of high performance, small band gap DPP‐based terpolymers are designed via two‐step side chain engineering, namely introducing alternating short and long alkyls for reducing the domain spacing and inserting alkylthio for modulating the energy levels. The new DPP‐based terpolymers are compared to delineate how the side chain impacts the mesoscale morphology. By employing the alkylthio‐substituted terpolymer PBDPP‐TS, the new polymer solar cell (PSC) device realizes a good balance of a high Voc of 0.77 V and a high Jsc over 15 mA cm−2, and thus realizes desirable PCE in excess of 8% and 9.5% in single junction and tandem PSC devices, respectively. The study indicates better control of domain purity will greatly improve performance of single junction DPP‐based PSCs toward 10% efficiency. More significantly, the utility of this stepwise side chain engineering can be readily expanded to other classes of well‐defined copolymers and triggers efficiency breakthroughs in novel terpolymers for photovoltaic and related electronic applications."

A comparative study using 4 × 2 polymer solar cell (PSC) performance maps and each of the [6,6]‐phenyl‐C71‐butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and the fused‐aromatic‐ring‐based molecule (m‐ITIC) acceptors are carried out. Given the similarities in their absorption ranges and energy levels, the PBDB‐TTn copolymers clearly reveal a change in the absorption coefficients upon optimization of the BDT to TT ratio in the backbone. Among the given acceptor combination sets, superior performances are observed in the case of PBDB‐TT5 blended with PC71BM (8.34 ± 0.10%) or m‐ITIC (11.10 ± 0.08%), and the dominant factors causing power conversion efficiency differences in them are found to be distinctly different. For example, the performances of PC71BM‐based PSCs are governed by size and population of face‐on crystallites, while intermixed morphology without the formation of large phase‐separated aggregates is the key factor for achieving high‐performance m‐ITIC‐based PSCs. This study presents a new sketch of structure–morphology–performance relationships for fullerene‐ versus nonfullerene‐based PSCs."

A cross‐linkable donor polymer as the underlying morphology‐inducing layer (MIL) to tune the vertical composition distribution of donor:acceptor in the active layer for improved PSC device performance is reported. With poly(thieno[3,4‐b]‐thiophene/benzodithiophene):[6,6]‐phenyl C71‐butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) as the active layer, the MIL material, PTB7‐TV, is developed by attaching cross‐linkable vinyl groups to the side chain of PTB7. PSC device with PTB7‐TV layer exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.55% and short‐circuit current density (JSC) of 15.75 mA cm−2, in comparison to PCE of 7.41% and JSC of 13.73 mA cm−2 of the controlled device. The enhanced device performance is ascribed to the much improved vertical composition profile and reduced phase separation domain size in the active layer. These results demonstrate that cross‐linked MIL is an effective strategy to improve photovoltaic performance of conventional PSC devices."

The attached conjugated side chains on both benzodithiophene (BDT) and NQx endow the resulting copolymers with low‐lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. The sulfur atom insertion further reduces the HOMO level of PBDTS–NQx to −5.31 eV, contributing to a high open‐circuit voltage, Voc, of 0.91 V. Conjugated n‐octylthienyl side chains attached on the NQx skeletons also significantly improve the π–π* transitions and optical absorptions of the copolymers in the region of short wavelengths, which induce a good complementary absorption when blending with the low bandgap small molecular acceptor of 3,9‐bis(2‐methylene‐(3‐(1,1‐dicyanomethylene)‐indanone))‐5,5,11,11‐tetrakis(4‐hexylphenyl)‐dithieno[2,3‐d:2′,3′‐d′]‐s‐indaceno[1,2‐b:5,6‐b′]dithiophene. The wide absorption range makes the active blends absorb more photons, giving rise to a high short‐circuit current density, Jsc, value of 15.62 mA cm−2. The sulfur atom insertion also enhances the crystallinity of PBDTS–NQx and presents its blend film with a favorable nanophase separation, resulting in improved Jsc and fill factor (FF) values with a high power conversion efficiency of 11.47%. This work not only provides a new fused ring acceptor block (NQx) for constructing high‐performance wide bandgap copolymers but also provides the NQx‐based copolymers for achieving highly efficient nonfullerene PSCs."

Besides photovoltaic performance, material cost and device fabrication process are among the key factors for practical applications. Herein, we report a facile molecular engineering approach with 4-methoxy modified thiophene as the conjugated side chain for polymer donors, which afforded lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and enhanced interchain interactions. Therefore, the corresponding PSCs exhibit enhanced open-circuit voltage and PCE compared with the counterparts with thiophene as the conjugated side chain.

To date, fluorination of organic semiconducting materials to fabricate polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been used far more than chlorination; however, fluorine exchange reactions suffer from low yields and the resulting fluorinated polymer always comes with a higher price, which will greatly hinder their commercial applications. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of chlorinated donor–acceptor (D-A) type polymers, in which benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene and chlorinated benzothiadiazole units are connected by thiophene π-bridges with an asymmetric alkyl chain.

The two copolymers were prepared by the copolymerization of alkylthio- or alkoxy-thienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT-S or BDTT-O) and thienothiophene with carbonyl and fluorine substituents (TT-CF), and they demonstrated strong and broad absorption spectra in the wavelength region from 450 nm to ca. 800 nm. The HOMO energy level of PBDTT-S-TT-CF was further down-shifted to −5.44 eV by alkylthio substitution on thiophene conjugated side chain of BDT unit and the carbonyl and fluorine substitution on TT unit. The inverted-structured PSCs based on PBDTT-S-TT-CF:PC70BM exhibited a high PCE of 9.58% with a remarkably high Voc of 0.89 V and a high FF of 71.0%. The PCE of the PSCs based on PBDTT-O-TT-CF also reached a high value of 8.68% with a Voc = 0.78 V and a higher Jsc = 16.5 mA cm−2, which is benefited from the broad absorption of PBDTT-O-TT-CF.

368,10.1039/C5TA08614K,2016,PBDT-TSR: a highly efficient conjugated polymer for polymer solar cells with a regioregular structure,"In this study, a regioregular copolymer (PBDT-TSR) based on alkythio-substituted two dimensional conjugated benzodithiophene (2D-BDT) and asymmetric thienothiophene (TT) was synthesized through two steps. Compared with its random counterpart PBDT-TS1, the PBDT-TSR shows improved absorption properties and enhanced inter-chain π–π packing effects. The hole mobility of PBDT-TSR is higher than that of PBDT-TS1. What's more, the enhancement of regioregularity does not have great influence on its molecular energy levels of the polymer and its miscibility with the acceptor material, PC71BM. The polymer solar cell (PSC) device fabricated by using PBDT-TSR shows a high power conversion efficiency of 10.2% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.99 mA cm−2, while the PBDT-TS1 shows a PCE of 9.74%. Overall, these results suggest that it is of great importance to investigate the influence of backbone configuration on photovoltaic performance for high efficiency conjugated polymers based on asymmetric conjugated building blocks, and to improve the regioregularity of this type of polymer should be a feasible approach to enhance their photovoltaic properties."

With use of different aryl flanking units on the DPP core, namely thiophene, pyridine or phenyl, optical gaps ranging from 1.91 eV to 1.13 eV are achieved. When blended with the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), the thiophene-flanked copolymer PDPP[T]2-EDOT with an optical gap of 1.13 eV was found to have the best photovoltaic performance, with an efficiency of 2.5% in an inverted device architecture. Despite having the lowest open circuit voltage of the three polymers studied, PDPP[T]2-EDOT-based devices were able to achieve superior efficiencies due to the high short circuit current of up to ∼15 mA cm−2. PDPP[T]2-EDOT-based devices also exhibit higher external quantum efficiencies which are associated with a superior microstructure – as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) – which is associated with the enhanced aggregation tendency of PDPP[T]2-EDOT chains.

PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI have band-gaps of 2.0 eV and 1.98 eV, which are comparable to that of the widely studied P3HT. Both copolymers also possess low-lying HOMO energy levels below −5.40 eV, which are expected to lead to high Voc values for their PSCs. The XRD analysis indicates their good molecular packing properties. Their photovoltaic properties were evaluated by using conventional devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al fabricated under different conditions. The PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices showed a relatively poor performance with PCEs of 2.83% and 4.13% with pure chlorobenzene (CB) solvent by adding 3 vol% DIO. The device performance was largely improved by using a co-solvent of CB and chloroform (CF) with increased PCEs of 3.76% and 5.01%. After employing the thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the PCEs of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices were finally increased to 5.04% and 6.35%. The gradually increased device performance would be attributed to the gradually optimized morphology of the related active blend films, which significantly induced a higher EQE response and hole mobility, giving rise to higher Jsc and FF values. Our results indicated that 1,2,5,6-naphthalenediimide is a promising acceptor block to build high-performance large band-gap copolymers for potential applications in single-junction and tandem PSCs in the future."
371,10.1039/C6TA02622B,2016,Enhancing the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells to 9.26% by a synergistic effect of fluoro and carboxylate substitution,"Two kinds of new conjugated polymers (P1 and P2) with benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and thiophene as the donor unit were designed, synthesized and used as donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs). These polymers show a broad absorption in the visible region, a medium band gap of about 1.75 eV, and a low-lying HOMO energy level of about −5.65 eV. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of both P1 and P2 was greatly improved to 0.85 V mainly due to the introduction of a carboxylate group at the 3-position of the thiophene spacer. Fluoro substitution on the polymer backbone of P2 can greatly enhance the interchain interaction, leading to a huge increase of short-circuit current density (Jsc). P2-based devices with the active layer spin-coated from 1,2-diclorobenzene (DCB) solutions that contain 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and washed with methanol showed a synergistic positive effect, resulting in a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 8.67%. The PCE could be further improved by constructing inverted devices and the best efficiency of 9.26% was finally obtained. In addition, the mechanism for achieving such a high PCE for P2 based devices was also proposed based on the morphological analysis of the blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing incident angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). The improvement can be ascribed to the enhanced molecular packing and proper phase separation of the blend films and the reduced charge recombination."

In contrast to PIDT-DTQ with the thiophene unit as the spacer, PIDT-DTQ-TT displayed a much broader absorption with suitable HOMO energy levels and high charge carrier mobility. Also an enhanced Jsc of 12.43 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.83 V comparable to that of PIDT-DTQ-based devices were observed in PIDT-DTQ-TT-based solar cells, indicating that the balance between Jsc and Voc in devices can be achieved when the spacer in the polymer backbone was altered individually in D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers. Finally, a maximum power conversion efficiency value of 6.63% was achieved without any post-treatment in solar cells. Our results here demonstrate that tuning the conjugated spacers in D–A–π–A type regular terpolymers individually could be an efficient method to balance the trade-off between Jsc and Voc, leading to an enhanced photovoltaic performance in solar cells."

By increasing the planarity of polymer chains and reducing the energy loss in devices, we have simultaneously acquired a high short-circuit current (Jsc) and a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs based on PCDPP, which is a regular alternating ternary conjugated polymer. This polymer has a medium optical band gap (1.55 eV) with low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels. In addition, PCDPP exhibits a very good planarity from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and forms a fibrillar network in the active layer of solar cells. Because of these integrated favourable effects, PCDPP-based photovoltaic devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.02% which is among the highest values reported so far for devices based on DPP-containing polymers. More importantly, the Voc of our PCDPP-based devices can reach as high as 0.86 V, which is much higher than that (<0.7 V) of high-efficiency solar cells based on other DPP polymers. These results provide a promising way to minimize the energy loss and to realize high Voc and Jsc values at the same time in devices to obtain high power conversion efficiencies."
375,10.1039/C6TA06610K,2016,Synergistic effect of fluorination and regio-regularity on the long-term thermal stability of polymer solar cells,"Three structurally identical polymers, except for the number of fluorine substitutions, namely PF0, PF1 and PF2, are designed and synthesized, in order to investigate the impact of fluorination on the thermal stability of polymer solar cells. Devices based on the three polymers can retain ∼90% of their initial efficiency, after annealing for 30 days at 100 °C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a series of novel materials achieving such long-term device thermal stability at high temperature have been reported. Accelerated aging tests show that device thermal stability ranks in the following order: PF2 > PF0 > PF1. Our findings demonstrate that PF2, with two fluorine substitutions and featuring regio-regularity, has the strongest ability to preserve the morphology, which endows the PF2 blend with a relative slow rate of morphological deterioration. In contrast, the morphology of mono-fluorinated PF1 shows the poorest thermal stability, which is ascribed to the regio-random characteristic induced by mono-fluorination. This work discloses the synergistic effect of fluorination and regio-regularity on device thermal stability for the first time, and systematically elucidates the “structure-thermal stability” relationship, which provides a guideline for designing materials with high device thermal stability."
376,10.1039/C6TA08591A,2017,"A wide band gap polymer based on indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene for high-performance bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells","Although wide band gap polymers have attracted much interest for applications in polymer solar cells (PSCs) as short-wavelength light absorbers in tandem devices, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide band gap polymer-based single cell devices are inferior to those of narrow-band gap polymers due to their restricted light absorption range. Thus, it is necessary to develop new semiconducting polymers for optimal device performance. Herein, a new wide band gap polymer (PIDTT-TT) was designed and synthesized by copolymerizing indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), resulting in a wide band gap polymer (PIDTT-TT) with an absorption onset at ∼580 nm (optical band gap = 2.14 eV). Electrochemical investigations indicated the low-lying energy levels (HOMO = −5.35 eV) of PIDTT-TT compared to those of P3HT (HOMO = 5.00 eV), which is beneficial for obtaining a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) in the device. The optimized morphology of the PIDTT-TT:PC71BM blend film led to a high VOC (0.96 V) and fill factor (FF) (0.66), which compensate for the limited light absorption range, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.10%. Furthermore, the deep energy levels of PIDTT-TT reinforced the air stability of the solar cell, which retained 85% of its initial PCE after being stored for 120 h under ambient conditions. Accordingly, PIDTT-TT is a potential candidate for applications in tandem solar cells. This study enriched the design rules of wide band gap polymers for high-performance PSCs."

The PSCs based on PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM achieved a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.3% with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.1 mA cm−2. These results indicate that the introduction of the 1,1′-vinylene-fused system into IDTV for ladder-type polymers is an effective strategy to enhance the light absorption coefficient and improve charge carrier mobility for high efficiency PSCs."

Both polymers exhibit temperature-sensitive aggregation in solution. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on them are fabricated with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor material. The devices based on P-TT deliver power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 9.96% while no additive is used. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of P-TT is insensitive to the polymer:PC71BM ratio and active layer thickness, and PCEs are all above 9% with the donor : acceptor (D : A) weight ratio of 1 : 1–1 : 1.8 (wt/wt) and film thickness of 200–360 nm. The high photovoltaic performance of P-TT is ascribed to its high and balanced charge carrier mobilities (4.51 × 10−3 and 3.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons, respectively), owing to the favorable face-on packing of the conjugated backbones as well as the desired morphology of the blend films. Our study demonstrates that alkylthiophenes are one kind of promising synthon of oligothiophene based D–A conjugated polymers, which can serve as side chains for tuning the aggregation of the polymer in solution and the packing mode of the conjugated backbones in the film state."

This polymer exhibits a low optical bandgap of 1.66 eV with an absorption onset of 745 nm, a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.52 eV, and a hole mobility of 5.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to the reported analogues, PSCs based on PBDTT-DTFPQx/PC71BM demonstrated an outstanding fill factor (FF) value. With an optimized blend ratio of PBDT-TFQ : PC71BM (1 : 4, w/w), a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.2% was obtained, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of up to 73% under AM 1.5G irradiation. The results demonstrate that the introduction of two fluoride atoms onto 4-positions of the phenyl group at the quinoxaline unit by side-chain engineering into the BDTT-alt-DTQx type polymers would be a feasible approach to improve photovoltaic properties in PSCs."

All the polymers are soluble in common organic solvents and they show similar optical bandgaps of around 2.0 eV as well as deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (below −5.48 eV). Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) using phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor material were fabricated. The side chains on the polymer backbone have a strong impact on the film morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blends. A phase separation with a relatively larger domain size was found for the polymers with longer side chains, while those with relatively shorter alkyl chains could form uniform films featuring a phase separation with a smaller domain size. Finally, PSCs based on PC1BT6:PC71BM exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 7.34% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V. Our results demonstrate that the judicious design of side-chains is effective in improving the photovoltaic performance of DIC-based polymers. With a larger bandgap than P3HT but an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a large Voc, this type of DIC-based polymer should be a promising bottom layer material for tandem solar cells."
382,10.1039/C7TC00083A,2017,Design of a thiophene-fused benzotriazole unit as an electron acceptor to build D–A copolymers for polymer solar cells,"A new electron-acceptor, thiophene-fused benzotriazole (BTAZT), is designed for the first time to construct donor–acceptor copolymers with bithienyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) as an electron-donor unit for polymer solar cells (PSCs). Compared with their analogous polymers, which contain a similar conjugated backbone but with the benzotriazole (BTAZ) unit as the acceptor, the BTAZT-based polymers show evident red-shifted absorption with narrower optical band gaps due to the fusion of the thiophene moiety onto the BTAZ unit to further stabilize the quinoid structure of their conjugation backbones. Furthermore, two types of side-chain groups, the alkylcarboxyl group (in PBDTT-BTAZT-1) or alkylcarbonyl group (in PBDTT-BTAZT-2), are introduced to adjust the energy levels and modulate the solubility of the PBDTT-BTAZT based polymers. It is found that the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the alkylcarboxyl group relative to that of the alkoxycarbonyl group at the α-position of the fused thiophene can further reduce the HOMO energy level to enhance the open voltage (Voc) in the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 based device. PSC devices based on these two polymers as electron-donating materials and a fullerene derivative (PC71BM) as an electron-accepting material are fabricated, and device optimization with additives (DIO or NMP) to modify the morphologies of the active layers and cathode buffer layers (PDIN or PDINO) to modify the cathode interlayers is investigated. The best PCE of approximately 7% is obtained for the PBDTT-BTAZT-1 based device with the DIO additive and PDIN-modified cathode interlayer. Notably, its optimal short circuit current density reaches 14.41 mA cm−2, which is one of the highest values ever reported in BTAZ-based PSCs with a PCBM acceptor. The best PCE of the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 based device also reaches 6.16% with the NMP additive and PDINO-modified cathode interlayer."

Two donor–acceptor copolymers of PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT were synthesized by utilizing the Suzuki and Stille coupling polymerization method with IDTI units. Both copolymers displayed excellent solubility, high thermal stability, broad absorption and a low band gap. The FET hole mobility reaches 2.1 × 10−2 and 1.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT, respectively. The conventional bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cell (PSC) devices based on the PIDTI-BT : PC71BM (1 : 2 in wt%) blend exhibit a moderate PCE of 4.02% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 8.99 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54.6% under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which is among the highest values for polymer donor materials based on multifused TI units. The improved performance may be associated with the extended conjugation length, which optimizes the interchain interactions and improves molecular organization for accelerating charge transport. Our results demonstrate that the multifused nonacyclic TIBDP as the donor unit is very promising for application in PSCs and FETs."

The PSC based on a blend of PDVF-8 with 2-octyldodecyl and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an active layer has shown a better device performance than the PSC based on a blend of PDVF-10 with 2-decyltetradecyl and PC71BM. Tuning the alkyl side chains attached on the PDVFs leads to an increase of power conversion efficiency from 3.57% (PDVF-10) to 4.56% (PDVF-8) due to enhancements of short circuit current and fill factor.

Our results demonstrate that the rotation barrier between the α-linked bithiophene significantly increases after the fluorination, so PBDD4T-2F has a more stable backbone conformation than PBDD4T.

The relationships between the substituted groups in TPA and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, as well as the open circuit voltages (Vocs), were investigated in detail. The HOMO levels of these four polymers decreased sequentially when the substituted groups shifted from electron-donating groups [–OC8H17, –C8H17] to electron-withdrawing groups [–CF3, –(CF3)2], which led to the successive increase in Vocs of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on these polymers. Through the characterization of photovoltaic performance, the highest Voc, which reached up to 1.00 V, was achieved by the polymer with bis(trifluoromenthyl) substituted group (P4), which is one of the highest Voc values based on polytriphenylamine derived polymers for PSCs.

Polymer P(BDTT–BTBDPPD) exhibited maximum absorption at 478 nm and the calculated optical band gap was 2.10 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of P(BDTT–BTBDPPD) were estimated to be −5.44 eV and −3.34 eV. The hole mobility of P(BDTT–BTBDPPD) was 3.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The polymer solar cells (PSCs) prepared using P(BDTT–BTBDPPD) : PC70BM (1 : 2 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO blend offered a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.62% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 7.99 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 64%. This study suggests that the replacement of the thiophene spacer unit located between the pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3(2H,5H)-dione units of bis(pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3(2H,5H)-dione) derivative with a bithiophene unit did not considerably alter the energy levels and charge transport properties of the resulting polymer. However, the overall photovoltaic performance was improved due mainly to the enhanced morphology of the photoactive layer."
400,10.1039/c5cp07705b,2016,New low bandgap near-IR conjugated D-A copolymers for BHJ polymer solar cell applications.,"We synthesized two novel ultra low bandgap donor-acceptor (D-A) copolymers (E(g) ≤ 1.2 eV), containing the thiadiazoloquinoxaline unit as the main electron accepting unit (A) and benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienosilole (DTS) as different donor units (D), denoted as P1 and P2, respectively, using the cross-coupling Stille reaction. The copolymers possess light absorption ranging from UV (350 nm) to near-IR (1300 nm) with optical bandgaps of 1.16 eV and 1.08 eV, respectively. Quantum-chemical calculations and experimental data were compared for proposing a more detailed concept for the optical and electronic properties of these copolymers which can be used as donors for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PSCs based on optimized P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM showed overall power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.32% and 3.48%, respectively. Although P2 possesses a broad absorption coverage of up to 1300 nm, the lower PCE may be attributed to the low J(sc), due to the poor driving force for exciton dissociation, since the LUMO offset with PC71BM is less than 0.3 eV. The PCE has been significantly increased to 7.27% and 6.68% for solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treated P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM active layers, respectively. This improvement arises from the appropriate nanoscale morphology and an increase in hole mobility, induced by the SVA treatment of the active layers."
401,10.1002/PI.5377,2017,"Design and synthesis of thieno3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione based conjugated copolymers for organic solar cells","A new series of conjugated copolymers (PBDT-TPD, PBDT-Th-TPD, PBDT-TT-TPD) containing donor-acceptor (D-A) structure electron-rich benzo1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT) units with branched alkyl thiophene side chains and electron-deficient 5-(2-octyl)-4H-thieno3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD) units was designed and synthesized. To tune the optical and electrochemical properties of the copolymers, the conjugation length of the copolymers was extended by introducing -conjugated spacers such as thiophene and thieno3,2-b]thiophene units. It was observed that PBDT-TPD showed broader absorption spectra in the longer wavelength region and the absorption maximum was red-shifted compared to that of PBDT-Th-TPD, PBDT-TT-TPD. Stokes shifts were calculated to be 52 nm for PBDT-TPD, 153 nm for PBDT-Th-TPD and 146 nm for PBDT-TT-TPD. Further, PBDT-TPD exhibited a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of -5.53 eV as calculated by cyclic voltammetry.

402,10.1039/C5PY01406A,2016,Poly(pentacyclic lactam-alt-diketopyrrolopyrrole) for field-effect transistors and polymer solar cells processed from non-chlorinated solvents†,"A semi-crystalline conjugated polymer based on two electron-deficient units, pentacyclic lactam (PCL) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), was designed and synthesized for application in field-effect transistors (FETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). The polymer has a high molecular weight, near-infrared absorption up to 900 nm and good solubility in toluene. When the polymer thin films were solution-processed from toluene with diphenyl ether as an additive, the FET devices achieved a high hole mobility of 0.81 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). With the same solution-processing solvents, bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on this polymer as an electron donor provided a power conversion efficiency of 4.7% with an optimal energy loss of 0.65 eV due to its deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level. Further study on the morphology of the pure polymer or blend thin films by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering reveals that the new polymer has good crystalline property, which is mainly due to the coplanar nature of the conjugated backbone. This work demonstrates that conjugated polymers incorporating several electron-deficient units can be potentially used in high performance FETs and PSCs."

Two D–A copolymers (PTTABT and PTTABDT) using TTA as the acceptor unit were synthesized, showing good solubility and medium bandgaps. The PTTABT film exhibits a broad absorption with a FWHM of 205 nm, while PTTABDT:PC71BM solar cells gave a higher PCE of 5.46%, resulting from its higher Voc and ideal phase separation in the active layer."
404,10.1039/C7PY00194K,2017,"Synthesis and side-chain isomeric effect of 4,9-/5,10-dialkylated-β-angular-shaped naphthodithiophenes-based donor–acceptor copolymers for polymer solar cells and field-effect transistors","A systematic methodology is developed to construct the angular-shaped β-form naphthodithiophene (β-aNDT) core with regiospecific substitution of two alkyl groups at its 4,9- or 5,10-positions via the base-induced double 6π-cyclization of dithienyldieneyne precursors, leading to the two isomeric 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT monomers. It is found that a more curved geometry of the β-aNDT units intrinsically increases the solubility and thus the solution-processability of the resultant polymers. Therefore, β-aNDT units are ideal for polymerization with an acceptor-containing monomer without the need for any solubilizing aliphatic side chains, which are considered the insulating portion that jeopardizes charge transport. Based on this consideration, the 4,9- and 5,10-dialkylated β-aNDT monomers are polymerized with the non-alkylated DTFBT acceptor to afford two P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT copolymers for head-to-head comparison of the 4,9-inner/5,10-outer isomeric alkylation effect. It is found that 4,9-β-aNDT adopts a twisted conjugated structure due to the intramolecular steric repulsion between the inner branched side chains and the β-hydrogens on the thiophene rings. The slightly twisted 4,9-β-aNDT moiety allows P4,9-βNDTDTFBT to have higher solubility upon polymerization and thus a higher molecular weight, which eventually induces a higher ordered packing structure in the thin film compared to P5,10-βNDTDTFBT. As a result, P4,9-βNDTDTFBT exhibits a higher OFET mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the P4,9-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM-based solar cell device also achieves a higher PCE of 7.23%, which is even better than the corresponding P4,9-αNDTDTFBT-based device."

An easy and powerful strategy of D–A copolymer design to enhance the performance of PSCs would advance their industrialization. Here we demonstrate an effective molecular design method using the simple molecular mechanics function of MM2 (Molecular Mechanic program 2) & MMFF94 (Merck Molecular Force Field 94) calculation and noncovalent conformational locking effects in the D–A polymer backbone. It is shown to play an important role in D–A copolymers with a highly ordered structure through intra- and/or intermolecular interactions. We report a newly designed D–A copolymer donor, poly(benzodithiophene-dibenzophenazine), P(BDP-DTPz), using our strategy which exhibits good solubility, high molecular ordering and excellent charge carrier mobility balance. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.2% is achieved with a P(BDP-DTPz):PC71BM blend under 1.5 G solar irradiation. This work will provide a new perspective for molecular design of D–A copolymers in PSCs."
406,10.1039/C7PY00696A,2017,Thiophene-benzothiadiazole based D–A1–D–A2 type alternating copolymers for polymer solar cells,"A series of D–A1–D–A2 type regioregular copolymers based on difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) and dialkoxybenzothiadiazole (ROBT) structures was synthesized. The copolymers were prepared with different alkyl chain lengths and branching point positions. The weaker acceptor, ROBT, was incorporated as a solubilizing moiety, while the stronger acceptor, DFBT, was used to enhance intramolecular charge transfer interactions with low-lying frontier orbital levels. The design of DFBT–ROBT copolymers ensures good planarity via intrachain noncovalent F⋯S, S⋯O, and F⋯H coulombic interactions. Changing the alkyl chain branching point and length had pronounced effects on the interchain packing and charge carrier transport/recombination characteristics of the resultant polymers, which in turn influenced their photovoltaic performances. P2 (with 3-hexylundecyloxy) showed tight π–π stacking, high charge mobility, reduced bimolecular charge recombination, and an optimal nanoscale morphology compared to P1 (with 2-hexyldecyloxy). We prepared photovoltaic devices containing a blend of the copolymers with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, and the resultant devices showed high power conversion efficiencies, 8.27% for P2, which is higher than that of P1 (6.87%). Furthermore, the alkyl side-chain length in P2 was varied systematically to study the correlation between the alkyl chain length in the interchain packing and photovoltaic performances. The variation in the alkyl chain branching was effective to modulate intermolecular packing to improve the photovoltaic performances. The optimum side chain length should be determined by carefully considering the solubility and interchain packing interactions."
407,10.1039/C7PY01060E,2017,High photovoltaic performance of as-cast devices based on new quinoxaline-based donor–acceptor copolymers,"Two new donor–acceptor copolymers, namely PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8, based on difluorinated quinoxaline (Qx) acceptor units and alkylthiothienyl benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor units with different alkylthio side chains were designed and synthesized. The two copolymers exhibit a lower-lying HOMO energy level and closer interchain packing than their analogues with alkyl side chains attributed to the more polarizable S atom inducing stronger intermolecular interactions. Of these two polymers, PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 with linear alkylthio side chains shows closer molecular stacking with PC71BM than PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH with branched alkylthio side chains. As a result, the polymer solar cell based on the blend of PBDT-DFQX-TTSC8 and PC71BM exhibited a higher PCE of 8.51% than that based on PBDT-DFQX-TTSEH and PC71BM, which was only 7.02%. More importantly, both copolymers show higher photovoltaic performances in as-cast devices than in those treated by additive or thermal annealing because an appropriate bulk morphology was formed during the process of spin-casting due to the strong interchain interactions of the polymers, which eliminates the need for solvent additives or thermal annealing."
408,10.1039/C5RA23863C,2016,Controlling the morphology and hole mobility of terpolymers for polymer solar cells,"A series of D1–A–D2–A terpolymers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as electron-deficient unit (A), alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) and thiophene-2,5-bis(2-alkyloxy)benzene-thiophene (TBT) as electron-rich units (D) have been designed and synthesized by Stille-coupling reaction. The effects of the TBT/BDTT ratios on the thermal, photophysical, electrochemical properties and crystallinity of the copolymers were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra, cyclic voltammetry and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, respectively. Compared with the binary copolymers (PDPPHT-TBT and PDPPHT-BDTT), the random terpolymers (PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT) exhibited significant improvement in thermal stability and hole mobility, and the optical, electrochemical properties, lamellar distance and π–π* stacking distance of the random terpolymers were successfully tuned with different TBT/BDTT ratios. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on the as-synthesized terpolymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor were fabricated. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.18% was obtained from the terpolymer PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT."

In this work, a new alternative conjugated polymer with 3,4-bis(octyloxy)-phenyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene as the donor unit and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the acceptor unit was synthesized and used as the donor material for polymer solar cells. This polymer showed good solubility in halogen-free solvents such as toluene, o-xylene and so on. The blend film morphology, charge mobility and photovoltaic performance were investigated in halogen-free solvents. The photovoltaic devices fabricated from o-xylene with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as additive provided the best power conversion efficiency of 4.57%, comparable to that fabricated from halogenated solvents such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane with a power conversion efficiency of 4.33%.

Two polymers PBDTT-fDTBO and PBDTO-fDTBO consist of fDTBO with thienyl-substituted-benzodithiophene (BDTT) or alkoxy-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTO). Both polymers show a deep HOMO around −5.5 eV with a wide band gap of over 1.9 eV. The polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on two polymers both show over 1 V high open circuit voltage (Voc) independent of polymer/PCBM ratios and solvent additives content in the PSCs active layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) based on PBDTT-fDTBO devices is 4.5% for single junction PSCs, and these polymers can be applied in tandem PSCs due to their wide band gap (up to 1.99 eV). This work demonstrates that the fDTBO unit is a promising building block to design wide band gap photovoltaic polymers with high Voc."

Both polymers presented wide absorptions (300–800 nm) in the UV-Vis region. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were −5.28/−3.60 eV and −5.38/−3.69 eV for TBFPF-BT and TBFPF-BO, respectively. PSCs with the blends of TBFPF-BT/TBFPF-BO and PC71BM (1 : 2, w/w) as photoactive layers exhibited relatively low photovoltaic performances. After optimizing with 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as additive, dramatic changes in short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) were seen, with PCE up to 6.80% and 5.98% under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 for TBFPF-BT and TBFPF-BO, respectively. Compared to TBFPF-BO, the higher PCE mainly benefits from the higher hole mobility and better morphology for the TBFPF-BT and PC71BM blend film."
412,10.1039/C6RA18464B,2016,Simple synthesis of novel terthiophene-based D–A1–D–A2 polymers for polymer solar cells,"Direct arylation was used to synthesize a series of novel terthiophene (T3)-based D–A1–D–A2 polymers and D–A2–D monomers in fewer synthetic steps. In these T3-based D–A1–D–A2 polymers, pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) was selected as the first acceptor A1, octyl-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) or 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) or fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) was selected as the secondary acceptor A2. T2-based polymer with the bithiophene segments (T2) as the donor was synthesized for comparison, too. UV-vis absorption, electrochemical properties, blend film morphology, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were studied to explore the effects of the oligothiophene unit and secondary acceptor moiety (A2), meanwhile, the fluorine substitution effect was also discussed. It is shown that the change of donor segment from T2 to T3 introduces a difference in the energy levels, crystallinity, polymer:PC71BM morphology and PSC performances between the T2-based and T3-based D–A1–D–A2 polymers. Varying the secondary acceptor (A2) from BT to TPD also promotes the crystallinity and backbone planarity leading to enhanced PSC performances of the T3-based D–A1–D–A2 polymer. Although the effectiveness of fluorine substitution for tuning the UV-vis absorption, energy levels and degree of crystallinity has been demonstrated, the insufficient EDONORLUMO − EPCBMLUMO energy offset and poor miscibility of polymer:PC71BM limit the short circuit current (Jsc). In addition, the highest Jsc of 12.98 mA cm−2 is achieved for P1, while the higher HOMO level limits the open circuit voltage (Voc) and leads to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.36%."

The effects of the variant acceptor moieties on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated. Compared with the polymers PSB-DFBT and PSB-DTDFBT with 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the acceptor moieties, the polymer PSB-FTT with 2-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (FTT) as the acceptor moieties shows smaller band gap, stronger light harvesting capacity, better appropriate microphase separation with (7,7)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), smaller domain size, more effective exciton dissociation and higher hole mobility. Therefore, the PSB-FTT-based bulk heterojunction solar cell exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency of 4.45% than that of the PSB-DFBT- (1.88%) and PSB-DTDFBT-based devices (0.48%)."

The thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties of the LGC-D013 were characterized. The polymer has a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.56 eV and an optical band gap of 1.84 eV in film. The OPV based on LGC-D013:PC71BM blend film demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.09%, with a relatively high fill factor (FF) of 72.55%. After 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) treatment with a 3% volume ratio, the short circuit current density (Jsc) was improved from 9.48 to 11.29 mA cm−2, and FF was improved from 72.55 to 73.13%, resulting in PCE improvement from 6.09 to 7.22%. The BHJ OPV using LGC-D013 as the donor polymer based on TPD and BDT with terthiophene showed an improved fill factor as high as 72%, which is higher than those of conventional TPD–BDT based polymers."
415,10.1039/C7RA01418J,2017,A comparative study of the photovoltaic performances of terpolymers and ternary systems,Random terpolymers were synthesized from the electron-rich unit thiophene as the donor and two electron-deficient units with complementary absorption as the acceptor. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated from these terpolymers were compared with those fabricated from the ternary blends of two alternating polymers to explore the best strategy for extending the light absorption range. The two approaches showed similar open-circuit voltages (Voc) but different short-circuit current densities (Jsc). The terpolymer strategy broadened the light absorption range and provided a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.8%. This is due to a high Jsc and high hole mobility. The device fabricated from the ternary blend exhibited a lower PCE (3.5%) compared to those fabricated from the terpolymers and alternating polymer blends due to the morphological incompatibility of the donor polymers. Our results illustrate the potential of the terpolymer systems as a promising strategy to effectively increase the light absorption and thereby performance of PSCs by combining two morphologically incompatible polymers.

The included electron-withdrawing atoms of the acceptor portion were varied between O, S, and F for tailoring the optical and electrochemical properties and the geometry of structures. Their effects on the film topography, photovoltaic and hole-transporting properties of the polymers were thoroughly investigated via a range of techniques. As expected, the stronger electron-withdrawing BO unit affords red-shifted absorption, low-lying HOMO and LUMO levels for the polymer PIDTT-DTBO. However, it depicts lower hole mobility and a less efficient charge collection in the active layer compared to the polymer PIDTT-DTBT. In addition, degradation of the solubility is observed in the fluorinated polymer PIDTT-DTFBT. As a result, a BHJ PSC (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/interlayer/Al) fabricated with PIDTT-DTBT attains the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.91%. These results thus demonstrate the potential effects of electronegative atoms on IDTT-based polymers and the structure–function correlations of such electron-donor materials for efficient PSCs."

The highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of PTBTfBTzSi are estimated from cyclic voltammetry measurements and are −5.38 eV and −3.67 eV, respectively. We have used this copolymer as a donor along with a PC71BM as acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PSC based on the optimized PTBTfBTzSi:PC71BM active layer (weight ratio 1 : 1.5 and 3 v% 1,8-diiodooctance (DIO)) as a solvent additive in chloroform, showed overall PCE of 8.91% (short circuit current of 14.36 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage of 0.94 V and fill factor of 0.66) which is higher than that of PSC based on a chloroform cast active layer (4.95% with a short circuit current of 9.53 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage of 0.98 V and fill factor of 0.53). The higher PCE is attributed to the balanced charge transport, elevated light harvesting efficiency and more favorable nanoscale morphology and enhanced crystallinity of the active layer processed with the solvent additive. Moreover, the energy loss in our polymer solar cell is 0.59 eV which is one of the lowest values among the most of the efficient polymer solar cells reported so far based on a fullerene based acceptor, to the best of our knowledge."
