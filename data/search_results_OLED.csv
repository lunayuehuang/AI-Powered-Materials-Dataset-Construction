In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of these three promising display technologies through nine display performance indicators, including ambient contrast ratio, motion picture response time, viewing angle and angular color shift, color gamut, resolution density, power consumption, cost, lifetime, and thin profile and panel flexibility. The advantages and disadvantages of each technology are analyzed, and their future perspectives are discussed."
1,10.1002/adfm.201808803,2019,Recent Advances in OLED Optical Design,"Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) have become a mainstream display technology in consumer electronics. Self‐emitting ability, transparency, true dark tone, and capability of being made flexible are some of the features of OLED displays, leading to a superior performance compared with liquid crystal displays. In addition to displays, OLEDs are also a strong candidate for lighting applications. Despite great advances in improving the internal quantum efficiency of an OLED to nearly 100%, the external quantum efficiency is still lacking behind due to optical losses. This review reports the latest advances in the optical design of OLEDs that address the external coupling efficiency of OLEDs. Discussed at first are the fundamentals of OLED optics and how the refractive indices of different layers in an OLED stack affect the extraction efficiency. Then, this paper reviews how microlens arrays, scattering layers, and corrugated structures can be used to recover the optical losses and improve the external efficiency, and the general optical designs for different optical structures for light extraction are presented."
2,10.1021/acsami.1c09189,2021,Why Do We Still Need a Stable Long Lifetime Deep Blue OLED Emitter?,"The need for a high efficiency deep blue organic emitter with narrow emission line width has never been so great. This is driven by the need to simplify the complex OLED stack for displays to enable larger substrate sizes to be used and greatly increase production yields. Here, the merits of using the hyperfluorescence scheme based around new multiresonance boron nitrogen molecules typified by DABNA type emitters are discussed and key requirements for suitable sensitizer hosts described, especially the photophysical requirements for optimal performance."
3,10.1126/science.abc8530,2020,"Metasurface-driven OLED displays beyond 10,000 pixels per inch","Metasurface-based microdisplays Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have found wide application in high-resolution, large-area televisions and the handheld displays of smartphones and tablets. With the screen located some distance from the eye, the typical number of pixels per inch is in the region of hundreds. For near-eye microdisplays—for example, in virtual and augmented reality applications—the required pixel density runs to several thousand pixels per inch and cannot be met by present display technologies. Joo et al. developed a full-color, high-brightness OLED design based on an engineered metasurface as a tunable back-reflector. An ultrahigh density of 10,000 pixels per inch readily meets the requirements for the next-generation microdisplays that can be fabricated on glasses or contact lenses. Science, this issue p. 459 Metasurface-driven organic light-emitting diodes produce high-pixel-density, full-color displays with high brightness and a wide color gamut. Optical metasurfaces are starting to find their way into integrated devices, where they can enhance and control the emission, modulation, dynamic shaping, and detection of light waves. In this study, we show that the architecture of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays can be completely reenvisioned through the introduction of nanopatterned metasurface mirrors. In the resulting meta-OLED displays, different metasurface patterns define red, green, and blue pixels and ensure optimized extraction of these colors from organic, white light emitters. This new architecture facilitates the creation of devices at the ultrahigh pixel densities (>10,000 pixels per inch) required in emerging display applications (for instance, augmented reality) that use scalable nanoimprint lithography. The fabricated pixels also offer twice the luminescence efficiency and superior color purity relative to standard color-filtered white OLEDs."

Since the first report on the potential use of iridium(III) and platinum(II) complexes for applications in OLEDs in the late 1990s, extensive efforts have been made by researchers on the development of various heavy metal-containing compounds with rich photophysical and luminescence properties and the engineering of device architectures to improve device efficiencies. Apart from the more well-studied iridium(III) and platinum(II) complexes, complexes of gold(III) recently have demonstrated their capabilities to serve as phosphorescent or thermally stimulated delayed phosphorescent or thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters, and their promising performances in OLEDs have attracted growing interest in the past decade. Nowadays, complexes of gold(III) with emission energies ranging from sky-blue to near-infrared with high electroluminescence performances have been obtained. In addition, high-efficiency vacuum-deposited and solution-processed OLEDs with benchmark efficiencies comparable to those of the iridium(III) and platinum(II) complexes have been realized. This Focus Review summarizes the development of various series of luminescent gold(III) complexes to date and highlights important milestones in the development and advancement of gold(III)-based OLEDs. Focus will be made on the molecular design strategies for gold(III) emitters for application as dopants in OLEDs, including those fabricated by vacuum-deposition and solution-processing techniques."

Herein, through interlocking of the diphenylsulfone (PS) acceptor unit of a reported deep‐blue TADF emitter (CZ‐PS) by a dimethylmethylene bridge, CZ‐MPS, a UV‐emissive TADF compound bearing a shallower LUMO energy level and a more rigid structure than those of CZ‐PS is achieved. This represents the first example of a UV‐emissive TADF compound. Organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) using CZ‐MPS as the guest material can emit efficient UV light with emission maximum of 389 nm and maximum total external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.3%. Note that this EQEmax value is twice as high as the current record EQEmax (4.6%) for UV‐OLEDs. This finding may shed light on the molecular design strategy for high‐performance UV‐OLED materials."

However, the current OLED polymer substrates are limited to weak thermal stability, which is not compatible with the high-temperature in OLED fabrication. Here, we developed a novel nanocellulose/polyarylate (PAR) hybrid polymer substrate with both high transparency and excellent thermal properties. Benefiting from the nanometer scale of the cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and the efficient interfacial interaction with PAR, the substrate exhibited greatly improved thermal stability, with a glass transition temperature of 192°C, the thermal decomposition temperature of 501°C, and upper operating temperature up to over 220°C. Meanwhile, the hybrid substrate exhibits outstanding mechanical properties. Notably, no apparent transparency loss was observed after the CNF addition, and the hybrid substrate maintains a high transmittance of 85% and a low haze of 1.75%@600 nm. Moreover, OLED devices fabricated on the hybrid substrates exhibit much improved optoelectrical performance than that fabricated on the conventional PET substrates. We anticipate this research will open up a new route for fabricating flexible high-performance OLEDs."

Such devices could strongly increase the energy efficiency and performances of conventional OLED displays, in which 50% of the emitted light is often lost due to the use of antiglare filters. In this context, herein, ten couples of enantiomers derived from novel chiral emitter designs are reported, exhibiting CPL, TADF, and aggregation induced enhancement emission properties (AIEE). Representing the first structure properties relationship investigation for CP‐TADF materials, this thorough experimental and theoretical work brings crucial findings on the key structural and electronic parameters (isomerism, nature of the carbazole substituents) governing the synergy between CPL and TADF properties. To conclude this study, the first top emission CP‐OLED is elaborated as a new approach of generating CP light in comparison with classical bottom‐emission CP‐OLED architecture. Indeed, the top‐emission configuration represents the only relevant device architecture for future microdisplay applications. Thereby, in addition to offer molecular guidelines to combine efficiently TADF and CPL properties, this study opens new avenues toward practical applications for CP‐OLEDs."

Traditional fluorescent emitters can only achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5%, far below expectation; therefore many efforts have been spent on increasing the EQE of OLEDs. Phosphorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence, triplet–triplet annihilation, and hybridized local and charge transfer are the most widely applied approaches to harvest the 75% triplet excitons for luminescence. As for selecting or designing suitable emitters for practical applications, it is strongly demanded to have an overall view about emitters of high exciton utilizing efficiency (EUE) from molecule level, i.e., the four common approaches mentioned above and some latest ones of the doublet, singlet fission, triplet–polar annihilation, and rotationally accessed spin state inversion, and also from the aggregated state such as aggregation‐induced emission. In this review, the current progress of highly efficient emitters is presented, covering the chemical structures, the high‐EUE mechanisms in molecule level and aggregated state, and their applications in OLED devices. This review hopefully will illustrate highly efficient electroluminescent materials and their mechanisms, but more importantly, provide helpful information on how to design or select suitable emitters for specific OLED devices."

However, desirable CPIs are difficult to obtain since the thermal and mechanical properties are sacrificed during CPI production through modification of colored polyimide. Here, a cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)/CPI hybrid substrate with high optical, mechanical, and thermal properties is introduced. Due to the outstanding mechanical and thermal properties of CNCs as well as their strong interfacial interaction with CPI matrix, the sacrificed properties are made up and hybrid substrate is demonstrated strikingly improved thermal properties and mechanical properties with thermal decomposition temperature of 555 °C, upper operating temperature of 320 °C, glass transition temperature of 289 °C, coefficient of thermal expansion of 31.62 ppm K−1, tensile strength of 128 MPa, elastic modulus of 3.72 GPa, and folding capacity of 160 000 times. Particularly, the substrate keeps an excellent transmittance of 86% at 600 nm and it is colorless. The OLED devices built on the hybrid substrates show outstanding performance, which is superior to that of OLED@CPI, and comparable to that of OLED@glass. It is expected that this work will open new avenues for fabricating high‐performance and low‐cost flexible OLED devices."

The hope is to inspire researchers to develop TADF polymers prepared by easier synthesis strategies and higher external quantum efficiency to promote emitter application."
14,10.1080/15980316.2019.1680452,2020,A prototype active-matrix OLED using graphene anode for flexible display application,"From the very first time that graphene was used as a transparent electrode for OLED applications, the emergence of active-matrix (AM)-graphene OLED displays has been envisioned. Realizing this expectation, however, turned out to be difficult. Two obstacles are the growth and transfer of a large-area graphene film and the patterning of a graphene film into pixels. To solve these problems, a process of patterning a graphene film without surface contamination was developed. The fabrication of OLED panels by the patterned graphene anode on Gen 2(370 × 470 mm)-sized and flexible substrates was successfully demonstrated. In this work, oxide TFT arrays were combined as a switching backplane, and a pixelated graphene OLED was used as an emissive layer, to realize AM-graphene OLED displays. To explore the technical feasibility of flexible AM-graphene OLED displays, the aforementioned components were formed on a flexible substrate.

16,10.1002/adfm.201404260,2015,Achieving a Significantly Increased Efficiency in Nondoped Pure Blue Fluorescent OLED: A Quasi‐Equivalent Hybridized Excited State,"Excited state characters and components play a decisive role in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) properties of organic light‐emitting materials (OLEDS). Charge‐transfer (CT) state is beneficial to enhance the singlet exciton utilizations in fluorescent OLEDs by an activated reverse intersystem crossing process, due to the minimized singlet and triplet energy splitting in CT excitons. However, the dominant CT component in the emissive state significantly reduces the PL efficiency in such materials. Here, the strategy is to carry out a fine excited state modulation, aiming to reach a golden combination of the high PL efficiency locally emissive (LE) component and the high exciton utilizing CT component in one excited state. As a result, a quasi‐equivalent hybridization of LE and CT components is obtained in the emissive state upon the addition of only an extra phenyl ring in the newly synthesized material 4‐[2‐(4′‐diphenylamino‐biphenyl‐4‐yl)‐phenanthro[9,10‐d]imidazol‐1‐yl]‐benzonitrile (TBPMCN), and the nondoped OLED of TBPMCN exhibited a record‐setting performance: a pure blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinate of (0.16, 0.16), a high external quantum efficiency of 7.8%, and a high yield of singlet exciton of 97% without delayed fluorescence phenomenon. The excited state modulation could be a practical way to design low‐cost, high‐efficiency fluorescent OLED materials."

In the present work, we show how by simple variation of molecular structure both blue emitters exhibiting delayed fluorescence and ambipolar high triplet energy hosts can be obtained. The compounds with a para-junction revealed higher thermal stability (TID up to 480 °C), lower ionization potentials (5.51-5.60 eV), exclusively hole transport, and higher photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (0.90-0.97). Meta-linkage leads to ambipolar charge transport and higher triplet energies (2.82 eV). Introduction of the accepting nitrile groups in the para-position induces intensive delayed fluorescence via a triplet-triplet annihilation up-conversion mechanism. By utilization of the para-substituted derivative as an emitter and the meta-substituted isomer as the host, a deep-blue OLED with the external quantum efficiency of 14.1% was fabricated."

In this work, the process flow and key technologies to fabricate the world's first large size 77‐inch transparent flexible OLED display are introduced. “White OLED on TFT + color filter” method is used to fabricate the aforementioned display. On both thin‐film transistor and color filter substrates, transparent polyimide (PI) was used as plastic substrate with multi‐barrier. In case of a transparent flexible display, the multi‐barrier is required for the additional consideration to overcome the decrease of transmittance due to the difference in refractive index of the conventional multi‐barrier. We developed the special multi‐barrier to increase transparency with superior water vapor transition rate characteristic. The optimized amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide thin‐film transistors were employed on the multi‐barrier, and it shows the highly uniform electrical performance and reliability on plastic substrate. Also, the typical panel failure mechanism during laser lift‐off process caused by a particle in PI is studied, and a sacrificial layer was suggested between PI and a carrier glass to reduce the panel failure. Finally, we successfully realized the world's first 77‐inch transparent flexible OLED display with ultra‐high‐definition resolution, which can be rolled up to a radius of 80 mm with a transmittance of 40%."

Device parameters; luminescence and current density are extracted using Silvaco ATLAS numerical device simulator and validated through the fabricated experimental results with a minor deviation of 3%. Furthermore, a mathematical model is applied to extract other device parameters such as electric field, charge carrier mobility, concentration and current density. Additionally, the multilayered device architecture is critically analysed through cut line methodology to better comprehend the internal device physics in terms of hole-electron mobility, concentration and their recombination. Subsequently, the performance parameters extracted using analytical model are compared with the results of internal analysis and a close match is observed. These results prove the Poole-Frenkel mobility-dependent behaviour in the OLEDs that varies following electric field. Analyses also highlight high electron and hole concentrations in the vicinity of the emission layer as a reason of high luminescence in the multilayered OLED, directly following the Langevin's theory of recombination in organic semiconductors. These analyses highlight the impact of different layers in the OLEDs and thus open up new horizons to further performance improvement in these devices."

The CN-T2T/Tris-PCz exciplex emission shows a high ΦPL of 0.53 and a small ΔET-S = -0.59 kcal/mol, affording intrinsically efficient fluorescence and highly efficient exciton up-conversion. The large energy level offsets between Tris-PCz and CN-T2T and the balanced hole and electron mobility of Tris-PCz and CN-T2T, respectively, ensuring sufficient carrier density accumulated in the interface for efficient generation of exciplex excitons. Employing a facile device structure composed as ITO/4% ReO3:Tris-PCz (60 nm)/Tris-PCz (15 nm)/Tris-PCz:CN-T2T(1:1) (25 nm)/CN-T2T (50 nm)/Liq (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm), in which the electron-hole capture is efficient without additional carrier injection barrier from donor (or acceptor) molecule and carriers mobilities are balanced in the emitting layer, leads to a highly efficient green exciplex OLED with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.9%. The obtained EQE is 18% higher than that of a comparison device using an exciplex exhibiting a comparable ΦPL (0.50), in which TCTA shows similar energy levels but higher hole mobility as compared with Tris-PCz. Our results clearly indicate the significance of mobility balance in governing the efficiency of exciplex-based OLED. Exploiting the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T exciplex as the host, we further demonstrated highly efficient yellow and red fluorescent OLEDs by doping 1 wt % Rubrene and DCJTB as emitter, achieving high EQE of 6.9 and 9.7%, respectively."

30,10.1002/chem.201800974,2018,Acquiring High-Performance Deep-Blue OLED Emitters through an Unexpected Blueshift Color-Tuning Effect Induced by Electron-Donating -OMe Substituents.,"A series of blue-emissive 7-(diphenylamino)-4-phenoxycoumarin derivatives bearing -CF3 , -OMe, or -N(Me)2 substituents on the phenoxy subunit were synthesized. Although both the -CF3 and -N(Me)2 modifications were found to trigger redshifted fluorescence, the -OMe substitution was demonstrated to exert an unexpected blueshift color-tuning effect toward the deep-blue region. The reason is that the moderate electron-donating -OMe group can endow coumarins with unaltered HOMO but elevated LUMO energy levels. Moreover, the -OMe substitution was found to be beneficial to the thermal stability of these coumarins. Therefore, the trimethoxy-substituted objective compound can act as a high-performance deep-blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) emitter, and OLED based on it emits deep-blue light with CIE coordinates of (0.148, 0.084), maximum luminance of 7800 cd m-2 , and maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.1 %. These results not only shed light on the molecular design strategy for high-performance deep-blue OLED emitters through color-tuning, but also show the perspective of coumarin derivatives as deep-blue OLED emitters."

However, conventional wireless communication systems for small wireless electronics devices suffer from low radiation efficiencies of miniaturized antennas implemented within less-than ideal locations and real estates. Here, we introduce the original concept of utilizing the entire transparent region of high-resolution organic light-emitting diode (OLED) touch displays to render an antenna that is invisible to the human eye. A transverse magnetic resonant mode antenna is formulated based on transparent conductive polymers, which are precisely realized using mesoscale formation of electromagnetic boundary conditions. Simultaneously, these electromagnetic patterns achieve optical invisibility. We show that the transparent antenna film can be integrated inside an OLED touch display and feature efficient radiation properties at 2.4 GHz.

34,10.1002/adma.201300753,2013,Triplet Harvesting with 100% Efficiency by Way of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Charge Transfer OLED Emitters,"Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) have their performance limited by the number of emissive singlet states created upon charge recombination (25%). Recently, a novel strategy has been proposed, based on thermally activated up‐conversion of triplet to singlet states, yielding delayed fluorescence (TADF), which greatly enhances electroluminescence. The energy barrier for this reverse intersystem crossing mechanism is proportional to the exchange energy (ΔEST) between the singlet and triplet states; therefore, materials with intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states, where it is known that the exchange energy is small, are perfect candidates. However, here it is shown that triplet states can be harvested with 100% efficiency via TADF, even in materials with ΔEST of more than 20 kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature) at room temperature. The key role played by lone pair electrons in achieving this high efficiency in a series of ICT molecules is elucidated. The results show the complex photophysics of efficient TADF materials and give clear guidelines for designing new emitters."

A major tradeoff of the strong cavity effect is its apparent color shift, especially for RGB-based OLED displays, due to their mismatched angular intensity distributions. To mitigate the color shift, in this work we first analyze the emission spectrum shifts and angular distributions for the OLEDs with strong and weak cavities, both theoretically and experimentally. Excellent agreement between simulation and measurement is obtained. Next, we propose a systematic approach for RGB-OLED displays based on multi-objective optimization algorithms.

Our optimization algorithm is proven to be effective for suppressing color shift while keeping a relatively high optical efficiency and wide color gamut."

The proposed pixel circuit employs high frame rate (240 Hz) emission driving scheme and only needs 3.5 μs for input data period. Thus, 3D AMOLED displays can be realized under high speed operations. The simulation results demonstrate excellent stability in the proposed pixel circuit. The relative current error rate is only 0.967% under the threshold voltage deviation ( ΔVTH_DTFT = ± 0.33 V) of driving TFT. With an OLED threshold voltage detecting architecture, the OLED current can be increased with the increased OLED threshold voltage to compensate for the OLED luminance degradation.

48,10.1002/CHIN.201423297,2014,Red to Near-Infrared Organometallic Phosphorescent Dyes for OLED Applications,"Abstract In modern research on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes represent one of the most studied class of compounds. The high emission efficiency caused by the strong spin-orbit coupling in the presence of heavy metals leads to the mixing of singlet and triplet manifolds so that both the singlet and triplet excitons can be harvested. For OLEDs to be useful in displays application, true red, green, and blue emissions of sufficient luminous efficiencies and proper chromaticity are required. In recent years, the development of materials for phosphorescent red OLEDs has indeed gone through several important evolutional stages. However, the luminescent quantum yields of red-emitting iridium(III) phosphors tend to be intrinsically low which are governed by the energy gap law for triplet states in which the luminescence quantum yields tend to decrease with an increase in the emission wavelength. Many red organic dyes currently in use do not show a good compromise between device efficiency and color purity. In general, a dilemma facing red OLEDs was realized in which efficient and bright dopants are not red enough, and red-enough dopants are not efficient and bright. In this review article, we highlight the recent progress and current challenges of efficient OLEDs based on cyclometalated iridium(III) dyes which exhibit saturated red and near-infrared electroluminescence. Optimization of the phosphorescent red OLED efficiency/color purity trade-off and extension of the work to other organometallic phosphors are also presented and discussed."

63,10.1039/C3TC31831A,2014,The influence of the diphenylphosphoryl moiety on the phosphorescent properties of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes and the OLED performance: a theoretical study,"A series of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes were investigated by using the density functional theory/time-dependent density functional theory (DFT/TD-DFT) approach to determine the influence of the diphenylphosphoryl (Ph2PO) moiety on the electronic structures, phosphorescent properties and the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) performance. The results reveal that the introduction of the Ph2PO group could not only dramatically change the electron density distributions of the LUMO and cause red shifts of the emission wavelengths, but also increase the oscillator strengths and the metal character, thus leading to larger radiative decay rates. Additionally, compared with FIrpic (a widely used kind of blue guest material in OLED devices), those complexes with Ph2PO substituents could improve the electron injection/balance ability, increase the Forster energy transfer rate and confine the triplet excitons to the guest phosphors, hence resulting in better OLED performance. Interestingly, further analysis indicates that, compared to IrpicPO with the Ph2PO group sited at the phenyl ring of the phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands, IrpicPOpy with the Ph2PO group sited at the pyridine ring of the ppy ligands performs better in the hole-trapping and hole-injection ability.

This substitution OLED device is based on a circuit-equivalent OLED model and can be used to design and test OLED dedicated drivers. Indeed, OLEDs are available on the market, but they are still very expensive and hard to obtain. Compared to a real OLED, the substitution device is cheap and robust and can be easily duplicated. Moreover, a photodetector is not required to measure the light output waveform. This can be simply done by measuring a voltage across a resistance. This model can be used, for instance, to simulate a large OLED panel made of several associated single OLEDs for various series/parallel connection strategies. It can also be used to simulate aging phenomena by changing the values of some of its components. This might be useful for the definition of strategies to compensate aging effects like luminous flux depreciation. Another advantage of such a device is its use for power supply tests as it could serve as a substitution load, at maximum deviation from standard OLED electrical characteristics. We discuss the theoretical model that was used as a basis for developing the device. The accuracy of the model was then evaluated, particularly in pulsewidth-modulation dimming conditions. Then, the hardware equivalent device was compared to a real OLED. Finally, an example of the potential use of this substitution device is given: It was successfully used to investigate the “overdrive” technique in order to increase OLED light output rise time. This technique improves the light output rise time by a factor of over 4."

Finally, based on the algorithm, we consider implementation issues and realize two application scenarios on a commercial OLED mobile tablet. The results of experiments conducted on the tablet with real images demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve significant power savings while retaining the visual quality."

Verifying that the desired and displayed visual patterns match along dimensions such as luminance, spectrum, and spatial and temporal frequency is an essential part of developing controlled experiments. With cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) becoming virtually unavailable on the commercial market, it is useful to determine the characteristics of newly available displays based on organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels to determine how well they may serve to produce visual stimuli. This report describes a series of measurements summarizing the properties of images displayed on two commercially available OLED displays: the Sony Trimaster EL BVM-F250 and PVM-2541. The results show that the OLED displays have large contrast ratios, wide color gamuts, and precise, well-behaved temporal responses. Correct adjustment of the settings on both models produced luminance nonlinearities that were well predicted by a power function (""gamma correction""). Both displays have adjustable pixel independence and can be set to have little to no spatial pixel interactions.

One successful approach for improved device efficiency has been to maximize the electron-hole recombination using dopants that emit from the triplet excited state. In this context, heavy transition metal complexes have recently gained tremendous academic and industrial research interest for fabricating highly efficient phosphorescent OLEDs by taking advantage of the 1:3 exciton singlet/triplet ratio predicted by simple spin statistics. Traditional room-temperature phosphorescent dyes are monofunctional materials working only as light-emitting centres but other key issues including charge generation and transport remain to be addressed in the electroluminescence.

New technologies, such as sophisticated organic layer structure, were applied to the device. The device also exhibited good durability such as storage stability, which is important performance in practical use. We hope that this paper will show possibilities to practical use of OLED in different types of displays, lighting sources for illumination use, back light and others. From a recent environmental problem and energy supply circumstances, light sources of low energy consumption and eco-friendly are demanded. An enormous amount of research effort goes into the field. Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is regarded as a powerful candidate because it is an area light source, can be driven at low voltage, and does not include a material which is harmful to the human body and environment like mercury.

The SiO thin films could be consecutively formed via thermal evaporation, without breaking the vacuum, after deposition of the OLED cathode. The plasma resistivity and UV-blocking characteristics of the SiO interlayer protected the OLED devices against electrical and optical degradation during the plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) passivation processes. In addition, the nonconformal deposition and hydroxyl group-rich surface characteristics of the SiO thin films yielded enhanced surface pinhole coverage and a higher initial film density in the subsequently deposited PEALD-based Al2O3 barrier film. As a result, the OLEDs with a SiO/Al2O3 bilayer passivation layer displayed a remarkably increased device shelf life compared to devices prepared using Al2O3-only passivation. A MOCON test showed that the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of the SiO/Al2O3 bilayer film was 0.0033 g/(m(2) day), 2.3 times lower than the rate of a single Al2O3 barrier film. The results of our study demonstrated the multipurpose role of a SiO interlayer in plasma-based OLED passivation. The layer acted as a damage-free protective layer for the underlying OLED devices and an assistant layer to improve the upper barrier film performance."

101,10.1145/2024724.2024737,2011,Dynamic voltage scaling of OLED displays,"Unlike liquid crystal display (LCD) panels that require high-intensity backlight, organic LED (OLED) display panels naturally consume low power and provide high image quality thanks to their self-illuminating characteristic. In spite of this fact, the OLED display panel is still the dominant power consumer in battery-operated devices. As a result, there have been many attempts to reduce the OLED power consumption. Since power consumption of any pixel of the OLED display depends on the color that it displays, previous power saving methods change the pixel color subject to a tolerance level on the color distortion specified by the users. In practice, the OLED power saving techniques cannot be used on common user applications such as photo viewers and movie players. This paper introduces the first OLED power saving technique that does not result in a significant degradation in the color and luminance values of the displayed image. The proposed technique is based on dynamic (driving) voltage scaling (DVS) of the OLED panel. Although the proposed DVS technique may degrade luminance of the panel, the panel luminance can be restored with appropriate image compensation. Consequently, power is saved on the OLED display panel with only minor changes in the color and luminance of the image. This technique is similar to dynamic backlight scaling of LCDs, but is based on the unique characteristics of the OLED drivers. The proposed method saves wasted power in the driver transistor and the internal resistance with an amplitude modulation driver, and in the internal resistance with a pulse width modulation driver, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed OLED DVS with image compensation technique saves up to 52.5% of the OLED power while keeping the same human-perceived image quality for the Lena image."

Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCD), OLED displays consume dramatically different power for showing different colors. In particular, OLED displays are inefficient for showing bright colors. This has made them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of bright colors. To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders webpages with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real time, and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a browser engine.

The dramatic advances in OLED performance have resulted in devices with projected continuous operating lifetimes of ∼2 × 105 h (∼23 yr) at ∼150 Cd m−2 (the typical brightness of a computer monitor or TV). Consequently, commercial products incorporating OLEDs, e.g., cell phones, MP3 players, and, most recently, OLED TVs, are rapidly proliferating. The progress in elucidating the photophysics and transport properties, occurring in tandem with the development of OLEDs, has been no less dramatic. It has resulted in a detailed understanding of the dynamics of trapped and mobile negative and positive polarons (to which the electrons and holes, respectively, relax upon injection), and of singlet and triplet excitons. It has also yielded a detailed understanding of the spin dynamics of polarons and triplet excitons, which affects their overall dynamics significantly. Despite the aforementioned progress, there are outstanding challenges in OLED science and technology, notably in improving the efficiency of the devices and their stability at high brightness (>1000 Cd m−2). One of the most recent emerging OLED-based technologies is that of structurally integrated photoluminescence-based chemical and biological sensors. This sensor platform, pioneered by the authors, yields uniquely simple and potentially very low-cost sensor (micro)arrays.

The substituted TRPPH2 was used as the host dopant, 4,4-bis-(m-tolyphenylamino)biphenyl (TPD) was used as a hole-transporting material, and aluminum tris(8-quinolinolato) (Alq3) was used as an electron-transporting material. The electroluminescent (EL) properties of these devices were studied to understand the light emitting properties of the substituted TRPPH2. Previous studies have found that the color emitted by the devices was dependent on the TRPPH2 dye concentration. The electronic effect of the horizontal substituents R of TRPPH2 influenced the turn-on voltage, brightness, and power efficiency of the devices. Also, the electroluminescence performance of the porphyrin-doped OLED devices depended on the effectual overlaps between the emission of electron-transporting material and the absorption of the dopants. This means that it is possible to evaluate the electroluminescence performance of the porphyrin-doped OLED devices based on the emission of electron-transporting material and the absorption of the dopants.

128,10.1889/JSID16.11.1125,2008,OLED lifetime issues from a mobile‐phone‐industry point of view,"Abstract— Lifetime issues have been a hot topic throughout the history of OLEDs. The rapid development of lifetimes since 2002 has enabled OLED displays to become acceptable for mobile phones. The lifetime requirements of 30,000 hours expressed by the representatives of mobile‐phone‐terminal makers were felt to be unrealistic to be obtained in 2003, since the lifetime of the blue color was below 1000 hours. Today, 5 years later, lifetimes of AMOLED panels are over 50,000 hours. OLED displays are suffering from a burn‐in effect due to limited lifetime. After 2003, it was understood by the panel and terminal makers that instead of lifetime, burn‐in sensitivity became the limiting factor from an AMOLED‐panel usability point of view. The burn‐in effect becomes visible at 2–3% luminance degradation levels between adjacent pixels. To take this effect into account in mobile‐phone applications, the lifetime needs to be increased from 30,000 to 60,000 hours, and suitable algorithms need to be used for the display of the terminal. There is also pressure to double the peak luminance values used in the terminals in order to improve the performance of the screen in outdoor environments.

This problem is typically addressed by the use of polymeric substrates with multilayered barrier coatings comprising alternating organic/inorganic layers. The multilayered barrier approach is critically examined using a numerical model based on a defect-dominated diffusion process combined with experiments involving face-to-face lamination of two barrier films. The modeling results identify two regimes, corresponding to two distinct permeation mechanisms, and provide scaling relationships and general design criteria for multilayered barrier coatings. The results suggest that the most significant gain in barrier performance can be realized when the thickness of the organic/adhesive layer(s) in the multilayered structure is less than the average pinhole (defect) size in the inorganic barrier layer(s). © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The OFPVs exhibit very similar PL spectra with 460–480 nm emission maxima but show large variation in the organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) efficacy: from a material that does not give persistent emission in test OLEDs (9,9‐diheptyl substitution on the fluorene ring) to materials with luminance efficiencies of 0.5 cd A–1 and greater (9,9‐diethyl substitution on the fluorene ring, methoxy and methoxy/heptyloxy substituents on the phenylethenyl rings). The best OFPV in an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(emitter)/Ca–Al (ITO: indium tin oxide; PEDOT: poly(ethylenedioxythiophene); PSS: poly(styrene sulfonate)) OLED configuration has 9,9‐diethyl substitution and terminal heptyloxy substitution (maximum luminance of 1500 cd m–2 at 12 V). Unlike the OFPVs, the neat OFPhs show not only EL at the desired blue output of ca. 400–410 nm emission maxima but also an undesired green emission component at 500–550 nm. Blending the OFPhs with poly(methyl methacrylate) eliminates the long‐wavelength component when the emitter load is 10–25 %, but the OFPh luminance efficiencies, turn‐on voltages, and maximum luminance tend to be poorer than those of the OFPVs. The deficiencies of the OFPhs appear to be attributable to thermal degradation and oxidative reactivity, although solid‐state annealing and a nonoptimal bandgap match to the OLED device configuration may also contribute."

In diodes with PS as the host matrix, hole-injection and electron-injection occurred directly in the D-b-A molecules residing close to the anode and the cathode, respectively. In the PVK diodes, hole-injection occurred primarily into PVK and the positive charge carrier was subsequently trapped on the D-b-A molecule, whereas electron-injection at the cathode side occurred directly into the D-b-A molecules. Charge-hopping between neighboring molecules then occurred until a hole and electron resided on the same molecule, which is equivalent to the formation of the CT excited state, and which finally relaxed by intramolecular charge recombination under the emission of CT fluorescence."

This has been proven for OLED microdisplays so far. Moreover, OLEDon- CMOS technology may also be excellently suitable for various optoelectronic sensor applications by combining highly efficient emitters, use of low-cost materials and cost-effective manufacturing together with silicon-inherent photodetectors and CMOS circuitry. The use of OLEDs on CMOS substrates requires a top-emitting, low-voltage and highly efficient OLED structure. By reducing the operating voltage for the OLED below 5V, the costs for the CMOS process can be reduced, because a process without high-voltage option can be used. Red, orange, white, green and blue OLED-stacks with doped charge transport layers were prepared on different dualmetal layer CMOS test substrates without active transistor area. Afterwards, the different devices were measured and compared with respect to their performance (current, luminance, voltage, luminance dependence on viewing angle, optical outcoupling etc.). Low operating voltages of 2.4V at 100cd/m2 for the red p-i-n type phosphorescent emitting OLED stack, 2.5V at 100cd/m2 for the orange phosphorescent emitting OLED stack and 3.2V at 100cd/m2 for the white fluorescent emitting OLED have been achieved here. Therefore, those OLED stacks are suitable for use in a CMOS process even within a regular 5V process option. Moreover, the operating voltage achieved so far is expected to be reduced further when using different top electrode materials. Integrating such OLEDs on a CMOS-substrate provide a preferable choice for silicon-based optical microsystems targeted towards optoelectronic sensor applications, as there are integrated light barriers, optocouplers, or lab-onchip devices."

Furthermore, the organic layers that make up an OLED can be engineered to be transparent in the visible part of the spectrum. In combination with transparent conductive oxides like Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) or Aluminum doped Zinc-Oxide (AZO) as contacts OLEDs may be built entirely transparent. One major issue to be addressed in the fabrication of these devices is the deposition of the top transparent contact without damaging the organic layers. Transparent OLED pixels can be arranged to form entirely transparent OLED displays. For the active matrix addressing of the individual OLED pixels, we use TFTs which are transparent themselves. Rather than silicon, they are based on the wide-bandgap semiconductor Zinc-Tin-Oxide (ZTO) and transmit about 80 % of the visible light (400-750 nm). The transistors typically have field-effect mobilities of 13 cm2/Vs (an order of magnitude larger than a-Si TFTs) and an on-off ratio of 106. The OLED pixel which needs to be driven may be positioned directly on top of the driver circuit. The pixels fabricated accordingly have an overall transmittance > 70 % in the visible spectrum. The brightness of the OLED pixels could be varied from 0 to 700 cd/m2 via the gate bias of the driving TFTs.

By segregating the planar MR‐TADF skeleton using two bulky carbazolyl units, herein a highly emissive molecule with enhanced quenching resistance is reported. The steric effect largely removes the formation of detrimental excimers/aggregates, and boosts the performance of the corresponding devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm, representative of the only example of single OLED that can concurrently achieve narrow bandwidth and high EL efficiency surpassing 40% to date. Even at doping ratio of 30 wt%, the EQEmax is retained to be 33.3% with nearly unchanged emission spectrum. This work provides a viable approach to realize doping‐insensitive MR‐TADF devices with extreme EL efficiency and color purity for high‐end OLED displays."

MR‐TADF compounds typically show very narrow‐band emission, high photoluminescence quantum yields, and small ΔEST values, typically around 200 meV, coupled with high chemical and thermal stabilities. These materials properties have translated into some of the best reported deep‐blue TADF OLEDs. Here, a detailed review of MR‐TADF compounds and their derivatives reported so far is presented. This review comprehensively documents all MR‐TADF compounds, with a focus on the synthesis, optoelectronic behavior, and OLED performance. In addition, computational approaches are surveyed to accurately model the excited state properties of these compounds."

To overcome the demands associated with deep blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, two deep blue TADF materials namely, DBA–BFICz and DBA–BTICz, are designed and synthesized by incorporating oxygen‐bridged boron (DBA) acceptor with heteroatoms, oxygen and sulphur‐based donors, BFICz and BTICz, respectively. Both TADF materials show deep blue photoluminescence emissions below 450 nm by enhancing the optical band gap over 2.8 eV through deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of heteroatom based donor moieties. At the same time, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of both TADF materials remain over 94%. The TADF device with DBA–BFICz as an emitter exhibits a good external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33.2%. Since both new TADF materials show deep blue emissions and high efficiencies, hyperfluorescence (HF) OLED devices are fabricated using ν‐DABNA as a fluorescence dopant. DBA–BFICz as a TADF sensitized host in HF–OLED reveals an outstanding EQE of 38.8% along with narrow full width at half maximum of 19 nm in the bottom emission pure blue OLEDs. This study provides an approach to develop deep blue TADF emitters for highly efficient OLEDs."
217,10.1039/C2TC00584K,2013,Development of high performance OLEDs for general lighting,"Since the development of the first white organic light-emitting device (OLED) in 1993, twenty years have passed. The power efficiency and lifetime of this white OLED were reportedly only <1 lm W−1 and <1 day, respectively. However, recent rapid advances in material chemistry have enabled the use of white OLEDs for general lighting. In 2012, white OLED panel efficiency has reached 90 lm W−1 at 1000 cd m−2, and a tandem white OLED panel has realized a lifetime of over 100 000 hours. What is more important in OLEDs is to shed clear light on the new design products, such as transparent lighting panels and luminescent wallpapers. These fascinating features enable OLEDs as a whole new invention of artificial lighting. In this review, we would like to overview the recent developments of white OLED, especially three key elemental technologies related to material chemistry: (1) low operating voltage technology, (2) phosphorescent OLED technology and (3) multi-photon emission (MPE) device technology."

Numerous approaches have been proposed to attain high efficiency OLEDs through the synthesis of novel organic materials, the design of light extraction structures and the design of efficiency-effective device architectures. In this report, we first summarise the efficiency records of OLED devices using fluorescent, phosphorescent, and thermally activated delay fluorescent materials. Importantly, we review all the available efficiency-effective device architectural approaches, which include using thin layer structures, low carrier injection barriers, high carrier mobility, balanced carrier injection, effective carrier confinement, effective host-to-guest energy transfer, effective recombination zone, effective exciton generation on the host, effective exciton confinement, p–i–n structures, and tandem structures. It is hoped that better device structures can therefore be devised upon suitable device engineering to achieve higher efficiency for OLED devices."

Moreover, actualizing highly efficient, pure‐blue, stable, and purely organic electroluminescence will pave the way toward the realization of cost‐effective, high‐quality, and long‐lasting commercialized OLED displays and illumination applications. Without the aid of noble heavy metal atoms, the newly emerging thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials can effectively utilize triplet excitons owing to the small singlet–triplet splitting energy (ΔEST) for rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, leading to the achievement of 100% internal quantum efficiency under electrical operation. Nevertheless, fundamental scientific challenges with respect to simultaneously achieving stable pure‐blue emission, large radiative recombination rates with short exciton lifetimes and small ΔEST continue to hinder the popularization of blue TADF materials. A review of the current state of blue TADF emitters is timely and underscores the key challenges that must be overcome toward the development of a stable, true‐blue TADF‐based electroluminescent application in the future."

However, most of the polymer films used as substrate have high transmittance and low haze. Herein, a facile route to fabricate a built‐in haze glass‐fabric reinforced siloxane hybrid (GFRH) film having high total transmittance (≈89%) and high haze (≈89%) is reported using the scattering effect induced by refractive index contrast between the glass fabric and the siloxane hybrid (hybrimer). The hybrimer exhibiting large refractive index contrast with the glass fabric is synthesized by removing the phenyl substituents. Besides its optical properties, the hazy GFRH films exhibit smooth surface (Rsq = 0.2 nm), low thermal expansion (13 ppm °C−1), high chemical stability, and dimensional stability. Owing to the outstanding properties of the GFRH film, OLED is successfully fabricated onto the film exhibiting 74% external quantum efficiency enhancement. The hazy GFRH's unique optical properties, excellent thermal stability, outstanding dimensional stability, and the ability to perform as a transparent electrode enable them as a wide ranging substrate for the flexible optoelectronic devices."

Especially, the paradigm shifts in displays from rigid to flexible types accelerated the market change from liquid crystal displays to OLEDs. However, some critical issues must be resolved for expansion of OLED use, of which blue device performance is one of the most important. Therefore, recent OLED material development has focused on the design, synthesis and application of high‐efficiency and long‐life blue emitters. Well‐known blue fluorescent emitters have been modified to improve their efficiency and lifetime, and blue phosphorescent emitters are being investigated to overcome the lifetime issue. Recently, thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters have received attention due to the potential of high‐efficiency and long‐living emitters. Therefore, it is timely to review the recent progress and future prospects of high‐efficiency blue emitters.

222,10.1002/anie.201506687,2015,Highly Efficient Near-Infrared Delayed Fluorescence Organic Light Emitting Diodes Using a Phenanthrene-Based Charge-Transfer Compound.,"Significant efforts have been made to develop high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with blue, green, yellow, and orange-red colors. However, efficient TADF materials with colors ranging from red, to deep-red, to near-infrared (NIR) have been rarely reported owing to the difficulty in molecular design. Herein, we report the first NIR TADF molecule TPA-DCPP (TPA=triphenylamine; DCPP=2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene) which has a small singlet-triplet splitting (ΔEST ) of 0.13 eV. Its nondoped OLED device exhibits a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.1 % with a Commission International de L'Éclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.70, 0.29).

223,10.1002/anie.202016089,2021,Highly Efficient Near-Infrared Electrofluorescence from a Thermally-Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecule.,"Near-infrared organic light-emitting diodes (NIR-OLEDs) are potential light-sources for various sensing applications since the OLEDs possess unique features such as ultra-flexibility and the possibility for low-cost fabrication. However, the rather low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR-OLEDs has been a critical obstacle for the potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR emitter exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and its application to NIR-OLEDs. The designed NIR-TADF emitter, TPA-PZTCN, has a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 40% with a peak wavelength at 729 nm even in a highly doped co-deposited film. The EL peak wavelength of the NIR-OLED is 734 nm with an EQE of 13.4%, which is unprecedented among rare-metal-free NIR-OLEDs in this spectral range. Further, TPA-PZTCN can sensitize a deep NIR fluorophore to achieve a peak wavelength of approximately 900 nm, resulting in an EQE of over 1% in a TADF-sensitized NIR-OLED with high operational device durability (LT 95 >600 hr.)."
224,10.1126/science.aah4345,2016,High-performance light-emitting diodes based on carbene-metal-amides,"Adding a twist for enhanced performance The efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is fundamentally governed by the ratio of emissive singlet to dark triplet excitons that are formed from spin-polarized electron and hole currents within the material. Typically, this has set an upper limit of 25% internal quantum efficiency for OLEDs. Di et al. manipulated the ratio of spin states through a modification of process chemistry. They introduced a rotation of the molecular structure, which inverted the spin-state energetics and enhanced OLED performance. Science, this issue p. 159 Spin-state inversion via intramolecular rotation can enhance the performance of solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) promise highly efficient lighting and display technologies. We introduce a new class of linear donor-bridge-acceptor light-emitting molecules, which enable solution-processed OLEDs with near-100% internal quantum efficiency at high brightness. Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low exchange energy, substantial oscillator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point."
225,10.1021/jacs.6b02463,2016,Circularly Polarized Phosphorescent Electroluminescence with a High Dissymmetry Factor from PHOLEDs Based on a Platinahelicene.,"Circularly polarized (CP) light is of interest in areas such as quantum optical computing, optical spintronics, biomedicine, and high efficiency displays. Direct emission of CP light from organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has been a focus of research as it has the immediate application of increasing efficiency and simplifying device architecture in OLED based displays. High dissymmetry (gEL) factor values have been reported for devices employing fluorescent polymers, but these CP-OLEDs are limited in their ultimate efficiencies by the type of emissive electronic transitions involved. In contrast, phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) can emit light from triplet excited states and can therefore achieve very high efficiencies. However, CP-PHOLEDs are significantly understudied, and the two previous reports suffered from very low brightness or gEL values. Here, we use a platinahelicene complex to construct a CP-PHOLED that achieves both a display level brightness and a high gEL factor. The dissymmetry of CP emission reached with this proof-of-concept single-layer helicene-based device is sufficient to provide real-world benefits over nonpolarized emission and paves the way toward chiral metal complex-based CP-PHOLED displays."
226,10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00174,2018,Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Path toward Efficient Electroluminescence in Purely Organic Materials: Molecular Level Insight.,"Since the seminal work of Tang and Vanslyke in 1987 on small-molecule emitters and that of Friend and co-workers in 1990 on conjugated-polymer emitters, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention from academia as well as industry, as the OLED market is estimated to reach the $30 billion mark by the end of 2018. In these first-generation organic emitters, on the basis of simple spin statistics, electrical excitation resulted in the formation of ∼25% singlet excitons and ∼75% triplet excitons. Radiative decay of the singlet excitons to the singlet ground state leads to a prompt fluorescence emission, while the triplet excitons only lead to weak phosphorescence due to the very small spin-orbit couplings present in purely organic molecules. The consequence is a ca. 75% energy loss, which triggered wide-ranging efforts to try and harvest as many of the triplet excitons as possible. In 1998, Thompson, Forrest, and their co-workers reported second-generation OLED emitters based on coordination complexes with heavy transition metals (e.g., iridium or platinum). Here, the triplet excitons stimulate efficient and fast phosphorescence due to the strong spin-orbit couplings enabled by the heavy-metal atoms. Internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) up to 100% have been reported, which means that for every electron injected into the device, a photon is emitted. While these second-generation emitters are those mainly exploited in current OLED applications, there is strong impetus from both cost and environmental standpoints to find new ways of exploiting purely organic emitters, which in addition can offer greater flexibility to fine-tune the electronic and optical properties by exploiting the synthetic organic chemistry toolbox. In 2012, Adachi and co-workers introduced a promising strategy, based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), to harvest the triplet excitons in purely organic molecular materials. These materials now represent the third generation of OLED emitters. Impressive photophysical properties and device performances have been reported, with internal quantum efficiencies also reaching nearly 100%. Our objectives in this Account are threefold: (i) to lay out a comprehensive description, at the molecular level, of the fundamental photophysical processes behind TADF emitters; (ii) to discuss some of the challenges facing the design of TADF emitters, such as the need to balance the efficiency of thermal activation of triplet excitons into the singlet manifold with the efficiency of radiative transition to the ground state; and (iii) to highlight briefly some of the recent molecular-design strategies that pave the way to new classes of TADF materials."

In organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), a stack of multiple organic layers facilitates charge flow from the low work function [~4.7 electron volts (eV)] of the transparent electrode (tin-doped indium oxide, ITO) to the deep energy levels (~6 eV) of the active light-emitting organic materials. We demonstrate a chlorinated ITO transparent electrode with a work function of >6.1 eV that provides a direct match to the energy levels of the active light-emitting materials in state-of-the art OLEDs. A highly simplified green OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 54% and power efficiency of 230 lumens per watt using outcoupling enhancement was demonstrated, as were EQE of 50% and power efficiency of 110 lumens per watt at 10,000 candelas per square meter."

However, TADF emitters generally have to be dispersed into host matrices to suppress emission quenching and/or exciton annihilation, and most doped OLEDs of TADF emitters encounter a thorny problem of swift efficiency roll‐off as luminance increases. To address this issue, in this study, a new tailor‐made luminogen (dibenzothiophene‐benzoyl‐9,9‐dimethyl‐9,10‐dihydroacridine, DBT‐BZ‐DMAC) with an unsymmetrical structure is synthesized and investigated by crystallography, theoretical calculation, spectroscopies, etc. It shows aggregation‐induced emission, prominent TADF, and interesting mechanoluminescence property. Doped OLEDs of DBT‐BZ‐DMAC show high peak current and external quantum efficiencies of up to 51.7 cd A−1 and 17.9%, respectively, but the efficiency roll‐off is large at high luminance. High‐performance nondoped OLED is also achieved with neat film of DBT‐BZ‐DMAC, providing excellent maxima EL efficiencies of 43.3 cd A−1 and 14.2%, negligible current efficiency roll‐off of 0.46%, and external quantum efficiency roll‐off approaching null from peak values to those at 1000 cd m−2. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the most efficient nondoped TADF OLEDs with small efficiency roll‐off reported so far."

The orientation of the transition dipole moment of the fluorescent dye is shown to have an influence on the EQE of the device.

The device efficiency and lifetime have improved considerably in the last three decades. However, for commercial applications, operational lifetime still lies as one of the looming challenges. In this review paper, an in‐depth description of the various factors which affect OLED lifetime, and the related solutions is attempted to be consolidated. Notably, all the known intrinsic and extrinsic degradation phenomena and failure mechanisms, which include the presence of dark spot, high heat during device operation, substrate fracture, downgrading luminance, moisture attack, oxidation, corrosion, electron induced migrations, photochemical degradation, electrochemical degradation, electric breakdown, thermomechanical failures, thermal breakdown/degradation, and presence of impurities within the materials and evaporator chamber are reviewed.

However, they are not fabricated via solution‐processing, which is an economical approach toward the mass production of OLED displays. Here, a solution‐processable MR‐TADF material (OAB‐ABP‐1), with an extended π‐skeleton and bulky substituents, is designed. OAB‐ABP‐1 is synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a four‐step process involving one‐shot double borylation. OAB‐ABP‐1 presents attractive photophysical properties, a narrow emission band, a high photoluminescence quantum yield, a small energy gap between S1 and T1, and low activation energy for reverse intersystem crossing. These properties are attributed to the alternating localization of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals induced by the boron, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. Furthermore, to facilitate charge recombination, two novel semiconducting polymers with similar ionization potentials to that of OAB‐ABP‐1 are synthesized for use as interlayer and emissive layer materials. A solution‐processed OLED device is fabricated using OAB‐ABP‐1 and the aforementioned polymers; it exhibits pure green electroluminescence with a small full‐width at half‐maximum and a high external quantum efficiency with minimum efficiency roll‐off."

In this work, two novel red emitters, BPPZ-PXZ and mDPBPZ-PXZ, with highly twisted donor-acceptor structures are designed and synthesized to study molecular design strategies of high-efficiency red TADF emitter for different applications. BPPZ-PXZ employs the strictest molecular restrictions to suppress energy loss and realizes red emission with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦPL) of 100 ± 0.8% and remarkable external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.2% in doped OLED. While its non-doped OLED only shows a low EQE of 2.5% due to its unavoidable intermolecular π-π interaction. On the other hand, mDPBPZ-PXZ releases two pyridine substituents out of its fused acceptor moiety as steric hindrance to suppress intermolecular π-π interaction. Though mDPBPZ-PXZ realizes a slight lower EQE of 21.7% in the doped OLED; its non-doped device shows a superior EQE of 5.2% with deep red/NIR emission at peak of 680 nm. The two emitters show leading performances among respectively doped red TADF OLEDs and non-doped deep red/NIR ones.

In particular, an intramolecular or intermolecular complex based on thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials has greatly contributed to improving OLED device performance. Although high external quantum efficiency has been the main objective of the development of TADF materials as hosts and emitters, recent interest has been directed towards the lifetime of TADF‐material‐based OLEDs. For the past several years, remarkable advances in the lifetime of phosphorescent and TADF OLEDs have been made using TADF materials as hosts or emitters in the emitting layer. Therefore, since TADF materials are useful as both hosts and emitters for a long lifetime, this work discusses the recent progress made in developing TADF materials for long‐lifetime OLEDs."

Such an EML system can promote efficient energy transfer from the triplet excited states of the sensitizer to the singlet excited states of the fluorophore, thus significantly improving the efficiency and lifetime of the device.

TADF relies on the presence of a very small energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states. Here, we demonstrate that time-dependent density functional theory in the Tamm-Dancoff approximation can be very successful in calculations of the lowest singlet and triplet excitation energies and the corresponding singlet-triplet gap when using nonempirically tuned range-separated functionals. Such functionals provide very good estimates in a series of 17 molecules used in TADF-based OLED devices with mean absolute deviations of 0.15 eV for the vertical singlet excitation energies and 0.09 eV [0.07 eV] for the adiabatic [vertical] singlet-triplet energy gaps as well as low relative errors and high correlation coefficients compared to the corresponding experimental values. They significantly outperform conventional functionals, a feature which is rationalized on the basis of the amount of exact-exchange included and the delocalization error. The present work provides a reliable theoretical tool for the prediction and development of novel TADF-based materials with low singlet-triplet energetic splittings."
241,10.1002/adfm.201603719,2017,Design of Lanthanide‐Based OLEDs with Remarkable Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence,"Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) able to directly emit circularly polarized (CP) electroluminescence (CP‐OLEDs) are rapidly gaining much interest, due to their possible applications in displays with antiglare filters and 3D displays. Development of more efficient CP‐OLEDs can open their use also in point‐of‐care and personalized diagnostic tools, since CP light alteration can be related to health state of irradiated tissues. In this work it is shown that the performance of chiral europium complex‐based CP‐OLEDs can be improved both in terms of external quantum efficiency (measured on all the Eu bands) and degree of polarization of emitted photons (as measured by the dissymmetry factor gEL), by proper active layer formulation and through a fine tuning of the architecture of the device. Polarization performances (gEL = −1) are obtained about three times higher than for any other CP‐OLED reported so far. Moreover, for the first time, it is shown that the position of the recombination zone (RZ) plays a major role on the polarization outcomes. In order to rationalize these results the level of light polarization is related to the position of the RZ allied with the reflection on the cathode through a simple mathematical model. The values predicted by this model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental ones."

The molecules show blue and deep‐blue emission because of the deep highest occupied molecular energy levels of the donor units. Besides, both emitters exhibit narrow emission spectra with the full‐width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 65 nm due to the rigid donor and acceptor units. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction results in a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio over 80%. By combining the effects, the OLED utilizing DBA‐SAB as the emitter exhibits a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.7% and 1931 Commission Internationale de l'éclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.144, 0.212).

In particular, phosphorescent materials have become core OLED materials as alternatives to the conventionally used fluorescent materials because devices made with phosphorescent materials exhibit excellent light-emitting performance. However, phosphorescent materials have several problems, such as their structure being limited to organic metal compounds containing rare metals, for example, Ir, Pt, and Os, and difficulty in realizing stable blue light emission, so the development of new materials is necessary. In this article, I will review next-generation OLEDs using a new light-emitting mechanism called thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Highly efficient TADF, which was difficult to realize with conventional technologies, has been achieved by optimizing molecular structures. This has led to the realization of ultimate next-generation OLEDs that are made of common organic compounds and can convert electricity to light at an internal quantum efficiency of nearly 100%."
250,10.1002/adma.200701730,2008,Pyridine‐Containing Triphenylbenzene Derivatives with High Electron Mobility for Highly Efficient Phosphorescent OLEDs,"Charge-transporting organic semiconductors are an important class of materials that play crucial roles in electronic and optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), [1] thin ﬁlm transistors, and photovoltaic cells. OLEDs, that have organic hole-and electron-transport layers sandwiched between two electrodes, show low driving voltage and bright emission and are of importance for application to full color ﬂat-panel displays and lighting. Since electron mobilities in organic materials, in general, are several orders of magnitude lower than hole mobilities, [2] electron-transport materials (ETMs) with high electron mobility are required to further improve OLED performance. To achieve an effective electron injection and transport in an OLED, a high conductive n-doped electron-transport layer is developed by Kido [3] and Leo [4,5] by coevaporation of ETM and highly active alkaline metal of Li and Cs. In this case, a hole-and exciton-block buffer layer is indispensable to prevent exciton quenching in the emissive layer by the dopants in the electron-transport layer. This may induce more complexity of device structure and thus higher cost for applications to ﬂat-panel displays and lighting."
251,10.1002/anie.201500242,2015,Organic Light-Emitting Diodes Using a Neutral π Radical as Emitter: The Emission from a Doublet.,"Triplet harvesting is a main challenge in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), because the radiative decay of the triplet is spin-forbidden. Here, we propose a new kind of OLED, in which an organic open-shell molecule, (4-N-carbazolyl-2,6-dichlorophenyl)bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM-1Cz) radical, is used as an emitter, to circumvent the transition problem of triplet. For TTM-1Cz, there is only one unpaired electron in the highest singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO). When this electron is excited to the lowest singly unoccupied molecular orbital (SUMO), the SOMO is empty. Thus, transition back of the excited electron to the SOMO is totally spin-allowed. Spectral analysis showed that electroluminescence of the OLED originated from the electron transition between SUMO and SOMO. The magneto-electroluminescence measurements revealed that the spin configuration of the excited state of TTM-1Cz is a doublet. Our results pave a new way to obtain 100% internal quantum efficiency of OLEDs."

253,10.1103/PHYSREVB.75.125328,2007,Triplet-exciton quenching in organic phosphorescent light-emitting diodes with Ir-based emitters,"We investigate quenching processes which contribute to the roll-off in quantum efficiency of phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLED's) at high brightness: triplet-triplet annihilation, energy transfer to charged molecules (polarons), and dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers. The investigated OLED's comprise a host-guest system as emission layer within a state-of-the-art OLED structure---i.e., a five-layer device including doped transport and thin charge carrier and exciton blocking layers. In a red phosphorescent device, $N,{N}^{\ensuremath{'}}$-di(naphthalen-2-yl)- $N,{N}^{\ensuremath{'}}$-diphenyl-benzidine is used as matrix and tris(1-phenylisoquinoline) iridium $[\mathrm{Ir}(\mathrm{piq}{)}_{3}]$ as emitter molecule. This structure is compared to a green phosphorescent OLED with a host-guest system comprising the matrix 4,${4}^{\ensuremath{'}}$,${4}^{\ensuremath{''}}$-tris ($N$-carbazolyl)-triphenylamine and the well-known triplet emitter fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium $[\mathrm{Ir}(\mathrm{ppy}{)}_{3}]$. The triplet-triplet annihilation is characterized by the rate constant ${k}_{TT}$ which is determined by time-resolved photoluminescence experiments. To investigate triplet-polaron quenching, unipolar devices were prepared. A certain exciton density, created by continuous-wave illumination, is analyzed as a function of current density flowing through the device. This delivers the corresponding rate constant ${k}_{P}$. Field-induced quenching is not observed under typical OLED operation conditions. The experimental data are implemented in an analytical model taking in account both triplet-triplet annihilation and triplet-polaron quenching. It shows that both processes strongly influence the OLED performance. Compared to the red $\mathrm{Ir}(\mathrm{piq}{)}_{3}$ OLED, the green $\mathrm{Ir}(\mathrm{ppy}{)}_{3}$ device shows a stronger efficiency roll-off which is mainly due to a longer phosphorescent lifetime $\ensuremath{\tau}$ and a thinner exciton formation zone $w$."

In addition, the system has low probability of direct trapping of charges at the dopant molecules and no charge‐injection barrier from the charge‐transport layers to the emitting layer. By combining all these factors, the OLEDs achieve a low turn‐on voltage of 2.4 V, a very high EQE of 29.1% and a very high power efficiency of 124 lm W−1.

There is limited availability of transition metals (TMs) such as Ir, Os, and Pt, which are used for color‐tunable phosphorescent emitters, and the use of the host‐guest strategy is necessary for suppressing the detrimental triplet–triplet annihilation inherently imparted by the TM‐centered emitters. The inevitable demands of organic host materials provide organic chemists with tremendous opportunities to contribute their expertise to this technology. With suitable molecular design and judicious selection of chemical structures featured with different electronic nature, the incorporation of hole‐transporting (HT) and electron‐transporting (ET) moieties combines the advantages of both functional units into bipolar host materials, which perform balanced injection/transportation/recombination of charge carriers and consequentially lead the OLEDs to have higher performancesand low roll‐off efficiencies.

However, the electroluminescence efficiency of most AIE‐based OLEDs remains low owing to the waste of triplet excitons. Here, using theoretical calculations, photophysical dynamics, and magnetoluminescence measurements, the spin conversion process is demonstrated between the high‐lying triplet state (Tn) and the lowest excited singlet state (S1) in AIE materials. Moreover, the relative positions of Tn (n < 4) and S1 are shown to have a significant impact on the spin‐conversion efficiency, thus influencing the harvesting of triplet excitons and the device efficiency. Finally, by selecting an upconversion material with an appropriate energy level for further utilizing the triplet excitons, a deep‐blue fluorescent OLED with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.08), a maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.2%, low efficiency roll‐off, and a high brightness of 16817 cd m−2 is developed.

However, most of them are usually employed as dopants in a host material. In this report, carbazole dendrimers with a triphenyl-s-triazine core are reported, which are the first solution-processable, non-doped, high-molecular-weight TADF materials. The dendrimers were obtained by a new and facile synthetic route using the tert-butyldimethylsilyl moiety as a protecting group. All dendrimers showed TADF in toluene. Measurements of the temperature-dependent luminescence lifetime revealed that spin-coated neat films also showed TADF with moderate quantum yields. OLED devices incorporating these dendrimers as spin-coated emitting layers gave external quantum efficiencies of up to a 3.4 %, which suggests that this device is harvesting triplet excitons. This result indicates that carbazole dendrimers with attached acceptors are potential TADF materials owing to their polarized electronic structure (with HOMO-LUMO separation)."

However, the majority of reported AIE‐active molecules exhibit only strong fluorescence, which is not ideal for electrical excitation in organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). By introducing various substituent groups onto the biscarbazole compound, a series of molecular materials with aggregation‐induced phosphorescence (AIP) is designed, which exhibits two distinctly different phosphorescence bands and an absolute solid‐state room‐temperature phosphorescence quantum yield up to 64%. Taking advantage of the AIE feature, the AIP molecules are fabricated into OLEDs as a homogeneous light‐emitting layer, which allows for relatively small efficiency roll‐off and shows an external electroluminescence quantum yield of up to 5.8%, more than the theoretical limit for purely fluorescent OLED devices.

However, high‐EQE OLED technologies suffer from relatively poor device lifetimes in spite of their high EQEs. In particular, the short lifetimes of blue phosphorescent and TADF OLEDs remain a big hurdle to overcome. Therefore, the high‐EQE approach harvesting singlet excitons of fluorescent emitters by energy transfer processes from the host or sensitizer has been explored as an alternative for high‐EQE OLED strategies.

Here, versatile indolocarbazole‐isomer derivatives are developed as highly emissive emitters and ideal hosts for TADF‐OLEDs to alleviate efficiency roll‐off. It is observed that photophysical and electronic properties of these compounds can be well modulated by varying the indolocarbazole isomers. A photoluminescence quantum yield (ηPL) approaching unity and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 25.1% are obtained for the emitter with indolo[3,2‐a]carbazolyl subunit. Remarkably, record‐high EQE/power efficiency of 26.2%/69.7 lm W−1 at the brightness level of 5000 cd m−2 with a voltage of only 3.74 V are also obtained using the same isomer as the host in a green TADF‐OLED. It is evident that TADF hosts with high ηPL values, fast reverse intersystem crossing processes, and balanced charge transport properties may open the path toward roll‐off‐free TADF‐OLEDs."

A series of deep blue to blue emissive TADF derivatives is developed, capable of deep‐blue emissions from 403 to 460 nm in toluene. Deep‐blue organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on this series of TADF emitters are fabricated, resulting in an electroluminescence peak at 428 nm and a high external quantum efficiency of up to 10.3%. One deep‐blue OLED has achieved the commission internationale de l'eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.156, 0.063), which is among the best reported TADF performances for deep‐blue OLEDs with CIEy < 0.07."

274,10.1002/anie.202000585,2020,Chiral-Phosphoric-Acid-Catalyzed Atroposelective C-H Amination of Arenes.,"N -arylcarbazole structures are of significant importance due to their wide prevalence in natural products and functional OLED materials. C-H amination of arene has been widely recognized as the most efficient approach to access these structures. Conventional strategies involving transition metal catalyst always suffered from confined substrate generality and the requirement of exogenous oxidants. Organocatalytic enantioselective C - N chiral axis construction remains elusive. Here we present the first organocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of novel axially chiral N -arylcarbazole frameworks via the assembly of azonaphthalenes and carbazoles. This reaction accommodates broad substrate scope and gives atropisomeric N -arylcarbazoles in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol. This approach not only offers an alternative to metal-catalyzed C - N cross-coupling, but also brings about opportunities for the exploitation of structurally diverse N -aryl atropisomers and OLED materials."
275,10.1126/sciadv.aas8721,2018,Flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display enabled by MoS2 thin-film transistor,"Highly flexible organic light-emitting diode display was demonstrated using MoS2 TFTs as an active-matrix backplane. Atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been extensively investigated in semiconductor electronics but has not been applied in a backplane circuitry of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display. Its applicability as an active drive element is hampered by the large contact resistance at the metal/MoS2 interface, which hinders the transport of carriers at the dielectric surface, which in turn considerably deteriorates the mobility. Modified switching device architecture is proposed for efficiently exploiting the high-k dielectric Al2O3 layer, which, when integrated in an active matrix, can drive the ultrathin OLED display even in dynamic folding states. The proposed architecture exhibits 28 times increase in mobility compared to a normal back-gated thin-film transistor, and its potential as a wearable display attached to a human wrist is demonstrated."
276,10.1002/pssa.201228310,2013,Doping of organic semiconductors,"The understanding and applications of organic semiconductors have shown remarkable progress in recent years. This material class has been developed from being a lab curiosity to the basis of first successful products as small organic LED (OLED) displays; other areas of application such as OLED lighting and organic photovoltaics are on the verge of broad commercialization. Organic semiconductors are superior to inorganic ones for low‐cost and large‐area optoelectronics due to their flexibility, easy deposition, and broad variety, making tailor‐made materials possible. However, electrical doping of organic semiconductors, i.e. the controlled adjustment of Fermi level that has been extremely important to the success of inorganic semiconductors, is still in its infancy. This review will discuss recent work on both fundamental principles and applications of doping, focused primarily to doping of evaporated organic layers with molecular dopants. Recently, both p‐ and n‐type molecular dopants have been developed that lead to efficient and stable doping of organic thin films. Due to doping, the conductivity of the doped layers increases several orders of magnitude and allows for quasi‐Ohmic contacts between organic layers and metal electrodes. Besides reducing voltage losses, doping thus also gives design freedom in terms of transport layer thickness and electrode choice. The use of doping in applications like OLEDs and organic solar cells is highlighted in this review. Overall, controlled molecular doping can be considered as key enabling technology for many different organic device types that can lead to significant improvements in efficiencies and lifetimes."

However, the operational lifetime of current exciplex‐based devices, unfortunately, falls far behind the requirement for commercialization. Herein, rationally choosing a TADF‐type electron acceptor molecule is reported as a new strategy to enhance OLEDs' operating lifetime. A comprehensive study of the exciplex system containing 9,9′,9′′‐triphenyl‐9H,9′H,9′′H‐3,3′:6′,3′′‐tercarbazole (Tris‐PCz) and triazine (TRZ) derivatives clarifies the relationship between unwanted carrier recombination on acceptor molecules, TADF property of acceptors, and the device degradation event. By employing a proposed “exciton recycling” strategy, a threefold increased operational lifetime can be achieved while still maintaining high‐performance OLED properties. In particular, a stable blue OLED that employs this strategy is successfully demonstrated. This research provides an important step for exciplex‐based devices toward the significant improvement of operational stability."

However, blue ones still remain a challenge on account of their relatively dissatisfactory Commission International de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and low efficiency. After analyzing the reported blue iridium complexes in the literature, a new deep‐blue‐emitting iridium complex with improved photoluminescence quantum yield is designed and synthesized. By rational screening host materials showing high triplet energy level in neat film as well as the OLED architecture to balance electron and hole recombination, highly efficient deep‐blue‐emission OLEDs with a CIE at (0.15, 0.11) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 22.5% are demonstrated. Based on the transition dipole moment vector measurement with a variable‐angle spectroscopic ellipsometry method, the ultrahigh EQE is assigned to a preferred horizontal dipole orientation of the iridium complex in doped film, which is beneficial for light extraction from the OLEDs."
279,10.1002/adom.201800565,2018,Perspective on Host Materials for Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Organic Light Emitting Diodes,"Organic light emitting diode (OLED) is a new yet promising technology that is anticipated to replace the liquid crystal display technology in the very near future. The development of both the emitter and host materials for OLEDs is indispensable to realize high device efficiency and optimal performance. Though the presently commercialized OLED panels mostly utilize phosphorescence emitters, the all‐organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitting materials have some obvious advantages. Considerable progress has been made in search of better performing TADF OLEDs in the past few years. Although major research attention has been drawn toward reporting new TADF emitters, the hosts are equally important in TADF OLEDs, as the doped films of the emitters mostly yield better results than the nondoped films. There are already some good reviews on the TADF emitters in literature. In this review article, the literature data specifically aimed at hosting TADF dopants are carefully selected and comprehensively summarized and categorized into several sub‐groups based on their structural features to draw the attention of the organic electronics research community toward developing new host materials for TADF OLEDs."

In particular, the performance of blue materials is a key factor that influences the extent of OLED applications. Although blue phosphors with triplet emission can realize high efficiency, their bad stability and severe efficiency roll-off at high luminance greatly hinder their applications. Comparatively speaking, currently, blue fluorophores with singlet emission are still the best choice due to their advantages of long lifetime and low cost. This review mainly focuses on advances in high performance blue OLEDs based on fluorescence emitters from the perspective of mechanisms and device structures. Efficient methods to harvest triplets, molecular orientation effects and stability are discussed in detail. We also demonstrate future directions for the design of materials and device structures for high performance blue fluorescent OLEDs."
281,10.1002/advs.201800436,2018,Red Organic Light‐Emitting Diode with External Quantum Efficiency beyond 20% Based on a Novel Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter,"A novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter 12,15‐di(10H‐phenoxazin‐10‐yl)dibenzo[a,c]dipyrido[3,2‐h:2′,3′‐j]phenazine (DPXZ‐BPPZ) is developed for a highly efficient red organic light‐emitting diode (OLED). With rigid and planar constituent groups and evident steric hindrance between electron‐donor (D) and electron‐acceptor (A) segments, DPXZ‐BPPZ realizes extremely high rigidity to suppress the internal conversion process. Meanwhile, the highly twisted structure between D and A segments will also lead to an extremely small singlet–triplet energy split to DPXZ‐BPPZ. Therefore, DPXZ‐BPPZ successfully realizes an efficient fluorescent radiation transition and reverse intersystem crossing process, and possesses an extremely high photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 97.1 ± 1.1% under oxygen‐free conditions. The OLED based on DPXZ‐BPPZ shows red emission with a peak at 612 nm and a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.60, 0.40), and it achieves high maximum forward‐viewing efficiencies of 20.1 ± 0.2% (external quantum efficiency), 30.2 ± 0.6 cd A−1 (current efficiency), and 30.9 ± 1.3 lm W−1 (power efficiency). The prepared OLED has the best performance among the reported red TADF OLEDs. These results prove that DPXZ‐BPPZ is an ideal candidate for red TADF emitters, and the designing approach is valuable for highly efficient red TADF emitters."
282,10.1002/adma.201705250,2018,Blocking Energy‐Loss Pathways for Ideal Fluorescent Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes with Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Sensitizers,"Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence‐sensitized fluorescence (TSF) offer the possibility of attaining an ultimate high efficiency with low roll‐off utilizing noble‐metal free, easy‐to‐synthesize, pure organic fluorescent emitters. However, the performances of TSF‐OLEDs are still unsatisfactory. Here, TSF‐OLEDs with breakthrough efficiencies even at high brightnesses by suppressing the competitive deactivation processes, including direct charge recombination on conventional fluorescent dopants (CFDs) and Dexter energy transfer from the host to the CFDs, are demonstrated. On the one hand, electronically inert terminal‐substituents are introduced to protect the electronically active core of the CFDs; on the other hand, delicate device structures are designed to provide multiple energy‐funneling paths. As a result, unprecedentedly high maximum external quantum efficiency/power efficiency of 24%/71.4 lm W−1 in a green TSF‐OLED are demonstrated, which remain at 22.6%/52.3 lm W−1 even at a high luminance of 5000 cd m−2. The work unlocks the potential of TSF‐OLEDs, paving the way toward practical applications."

However, most reported thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters suffer from concentration quenching and exciton annihilation, so that they require complicated doping technique in OLED application. Nonetheless, the serious efficiency roll‐off remains a big challenge for doped OLEDs of TADF emitters. To simplify the fabrication process and improve the stability of devices, developing organic emitters for nondoped OLEDs is of high significance. This progress report provides a systematic summary and comments on the recent advances of efficient organic luminescent materials including conventional TADF materials and novel aggregation‐induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF) luminogens for the fabrication of high‐performance nondoped OLEDs. Their molecular design strategies, photophysical properties, and electroluminescence performances in nondoped OLEDs are elucidated in depth. The newly emerged organic materials with AIDF nature could be a promising direction for exploring light‐emitting materials to advance efficiency and stability of OLEDs."

Iridium(III)bis[(4,6-difluorophenyl)- pyridinato-N,C2']picolinate (FIrpic) is used as the emitter, which turns out to have a preferred horizontal dipole orientation in the emitting layer. The OLED shows a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.5% (a maximum current efficiency of 62.2 cd A(-1) ), which is in perfect agreement with the theoretical prediction."
285,10.1002/adfm.201701314,2017,White Organic LED with a Luminous Efficacy Exceeding 100 lm W−1 without Light Out‐Coupling Enhancement Techniques,"Luminous efficacy (LE), which is given by the ratio of luminous flux to power, is commonly used to measure the power consumption of a light source. Unfortunately, the LE of white organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) still lags behind those of inorganic LED for practically used (>100 lm W−1). In this paper, an ultraefficient white OLED is discussed based on a newly designed thermally activated delayed fluorescent exciplex host. The resulting white OLED delivers an unusually high forward‐viewing LE of 105.0 lm W−1 and external quantum efficiency (EQE) ηext of ≈30% (without using any optical out‐coupling techniques). As far as it is known, specifically, these efficiencies are the highest values among the published white OLEDs to date. Two‐color warm white emission is realized with Commission International de I'Eclairage coordinates of (0.40, 0.48) at a brightness of 1000 cd m−2. Furthermore, the well‐matched energy alignment endows the device with an extremely low turn‐on voltage (≈2.5 V). Such high efficiencies and excellent device performance should benefit from the advantages of exciplex material solely used as the host. Therefore, this study anticipates that the findings have great potential to boost the LE of OLEDs, and more importantly, fulfill the power efficacy requirement for lighting applications."
286,10.1002/adfm.202000019,2020,A Multifunctional Bipolar Luminogen with Delayed Fluorescence for High‐Performance Monochromatic and Color‐Stable Warm‐White OLEDs,"Increasing exciton utilization and reducing exciton annihilation are crucial to achieve high performance of organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs), which greatly depend on molecular engineering of emitters and hosts. A novel luminogen (SBF‐BP‐DMAC) is synthesized and characterized. Its crystal and electronic structures, thermal stability, electrochemical behavior, carrier transport, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence are investigated. SBF‐BP‐DMAC exhibits enhanced photoluminescence and promotes delayed fluorescence in solid state and bipolar carrier transport ability, and thus holds multifunctionality of emitter and host for OLEDs. Using SBF‐BP‐DMAC as an emitter, the nondoped OLEDs exhibit maximum electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies of 67.2 cd A−1, 65.9 lm W−1, and 20.1%, and the doped OLEDs provide maximum EL efficiencies of 79.1 cd A−1, 70.7 lm W−1, and 24.5%. A representative orange phosphor, Ir(tptpy)2acac, is doped into SBF‐BP‐DMAC for OLED fabrication, giving rise to superior EL efficiencies of 88.0 cd A−1, 108.0 lm W−1, and 26.8% for orange phosphorescent OLEDs, and forward‐viewing EL efficiencies of 69.3 cd A−1, 45.8 lm W−1, and 21.0% for two‐color hybrid warm‐white OLEDs. All of these OLEDs can retain high EL efficiencies at high luminance, with very small efficiency roll‐offs. The outstanding EL performance demonstrates the great potentials of SBF‐BP‐DMAC in practical display and lighting devices."
287,10.1021/acsnano.0c06649,2020,Parallel-Stacked Flexible Organic Light-Emitting Diodes for Wearable Photodynamic Therapeutics and Color-Tunable Optoelectronics.,"Deformable organic light-emitting diode (OLED) based optoelectronic devices hold promise for various wearable applications including biomedical systems and displays, but current OLED technologies require high voltage and lack the power needed for wearable photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications and wearable displays. This paper presents a parallel-stacked OLED (PAOLED) with high power, more than 100 mW/cm2, at low voltage (<8 V). The current dispersion ratio can be tuned by optimizing the structure of the individual OLEDs stacked to create the PAOLED, allowing control of the PAOLED's wavelength shapes, current efficiency, and power. In this study, a fabricated PAOLED operated reliably for 100 h at a high power of 35 mW/cm2. Confirming its potential application to PDT, the measured singlet oxygen generation ratio of the PAOLED was found to be 3.8 times higher than the reference OLED. The high-power PAOLED achieved a 24% reduction in melanoma cancer cell viability after a short (0.5 h) irradiation. In addition, a white light PAOLED with color tuning was realized through OLED color combination, and a high brightness of over 30 000 cd/m2 was realized, below 8.5 V. In conclusion, the PAOLED was demonstrated to be suitable for a variety of low-voltage, high-power wearable optoelectronic applications."

Electronic applications are continuously developing and taking new forms. Foldable, rollable, and wearable displays are applicable for human health care monitoring or robotics, and their operation relies on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Yet, the development of semiconducting materials with high mechanical flexibility has remained a challenge and restricted their use in unusual format electronics. This study presents a wearable full-color OLED display using a two-dimensional (2D) material-based backplane transistor. The 18-by-18 thin-film transistor array was fabricated on a thin MoS2 film that was transferred to Al2O3 (30 nm)/polyethylene terephthalate (6 μm). Red, green, and blue OLED pixels were deposited on the device surface. This 2D material offered excellent mechanical and electrical properties and proved to be capable of driving circuits for the control of OLED pixels. The ultrathin device substrate allowed for integration of the display on an unusual substrate, namely, a human hand."

However, the performance of AIE fluorophor‐based OLEDs (AIE OLEDs) is unsatisfactory, particularly for deep‐blue devices (CIEy < 0.15). Here, by enhancing the device engineering, a deep‐blue AIE OLED exhibits low voltage (i.e., 2.75 V at 1 cd m−2), high luminance (17 721 cd m−2), high efficiency (4.3 lm W−1), and low efficiency roll‐off (3.6 lm W−1 at 1000 cd m−2), which is the best deep‐blue AIE OLED. Then, blue AIE fluorophors, for the first time, have been demonstrated to achieve high‐performance hybrid white OLEDs (WOLEDs). The two‐color WOLEDs exhibit i) stable colors and the highest efficiency among pure‐white hybrid WOLEDs (32.0 lm W−1); ii) stable colors, high efficiency, and very low efficiency roll‐off; or iii) unprecedented efficiencies at high luminances (i.e., 70.2 cd A−1, 43.4 lm W−1 at 10 000 cd m−2). Moreover, a three‐color WOLED exhibits wide correlated color temperatures (10 690–2328 K), which is the first hybrid WOLED showing sunlight‐style emission. These findings will open a novel concept that blue AIE fluorophors are promising candidates to develop high‐performance hybrid WOLEDs, which have a bright prospect for the future displays and lightings."
290,10.1039/C7TC02156A,2017,Perspective on carbazole-based organic compounds as emitters and hosts in TADF applications,"The field of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) has undergone a remarkable journey since its discovery by Tang and VanSlyke with an alternation of utilizing fluorescence and phosphorescence as the emitting vehicle. The latest generation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials harvest triplet excited states back into the singlet manifold. This booming field has yielded a large array of new compounds as both emitters and hosts. This review is limited to TADF emitters utilizing at least one carbazole unit as a donor and organized according to the various acceptor building blocks such as cyanophenyl, pyridine, biphenyls, anthraquinone, phenyl(pyridine-2-yl)methanone, benzophenone, xanthon, sulfones, triazines, benzils, dicyanopyrazines, diazatriphenylene, and others. A survey of carbazole-containing host materials follows. Density functional theory (DFT) has carved out a significant role in allowing the theoretical prediction of ground state properties for materials applied in OLED technology. Time-dependent DFT extends the reach to model excited state properties important to rationalize the light-output in OLED technology. For TADF, two fundamental factors are of interest: significant separation of frontier molecular orbitals and minimal singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔEST). In this review, the utilization of DFT calculations to optimize geometries for the visualization of frontier molecular orbital separation was surveyed to find that the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory is the overwhelmingly used approach. In addition, we review the more in-depth approaches to utilizing DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) with optimized percentage Hartree–Fock (OHF) and long-range corrected hybrid functionals, tuning procedures and others in an attempt to best quantify the size of ΔEST as well as the nature of the triplet state as locally excited state (LE) and charge-transfer state (CT)."
291,10.1021/ar200119g,2012,"The modification of indium tin oxide with phosphonic acids: mechanism of binding, tuning of surface properties, and potential for use in organic electronic applications.","Transparent metal oxides, in particular, indium tin oxide (ITO), are critical transparent contact materials for applications in next-generation organic electronics, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Understanding and controlling the surface properties of ITO allows for the molecular engineering of the ITO-organic interface, resulting in fine control of the interfacial chemistries and electronics. In particular, both surface energy matching and work function compatibility at material interfaces can result in marked improvement in OLED and OPV performance. Although there are numerous ways to change the surface properties of ITO, one of the more successful surface modifications is the use of monolayers based on organic molecules with widely variable end functional groups. Phosphonic acids (PAs) are known to bind strongly to metal oxides and form robust monolayers on many different metal oxide materials. They also demonstrate several advantages over other functionalizing moieties such as silanes or carboxylic acids. Most notably, PAs can be stored in ambient conditions without degradation, and the surface modification procedures are typically robust and easy to employ. This Account focuses on our research studying PA binding to ITO, the tunable properties of the resulting surfaces, and subsequent effects on the performance of organic electronic devices. We have used surface characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) to determine that PAs bind to ITO in a predominantly bidentate fashion (where two of three oxygen atoms from the PA are involved in surface binding). Modification of the functional R-groups on PAs allows us to control and tune the surface energy and work function of the ITO surface. In one study using fluorinated benzyl PAs, we can keep the surface energy of ITO relatively low and constant but tune the surface work function. PA modification of ITO has resulted in materials that are more stable and more compatible with subsequently deposited organic materials, an effective work function that can be tuned by over 1 eV, and energy barriers to hole injection (OLED) or hole-harvesting (OPV) that can be well matched to the frontier orbital energies of the organic active layers, leading to better overall device properties."

The lenses, which are considerably smaller than, and not aligned to the OLEDs, outcouple light that is emitted outside of the escape cone of the substrate. We show that an electrophosphorescent device based on a fac tris(2-phenylpyridine)Iridium (Ir(ppy)3) doped emitting layer has its external quantum efficiency increased from 9.5% using a flat glass substrate, to 14.5% at low current densities using a substrate with microlenses.

Herein, the design and synthesis of tailor‐made bipolar blue luminogens with an anthracene core and various functional groups are reported. The thermal stabilities, photophysical properties, electronic structures, electrochemical behaviors, carrier transport abilities, and electroluminescence performances are systematically investigated. The luminogen TPE‐TAPBI containing a tetraphenylethene moiety shows aggregation‐induced emission, while another luminogen TriPE‐TAPBI bearing a triphenylethene unit exhibits light aggregation‐caused quenching. In comparison with TriPE‐TAPBI, TPE‐TAPBI has stronger blue emission in neat film and functions more efficiently in nondoped organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). High maxima current, power, and external quantum efficiencies of 7.21 cd A−1, 6.78 lm W−1, and 5.73%, respectively, are attained by the nondoped blue OLED of TPE‐TAPBI (CIEx,y = 0.15, 0.16).

In spite of notable breakthroughs in the lighting fiber technology, a class of information displays with a luminescent fiber network is still underdeveloped due to several formidable challenges such as limited electroluminescence fiber performance, acute vulnerability to chemical and mechanical factors, and lack of decent engineering schemes to form fibers with robust interconnectable pixels for two-dimensional matrix addressing. Here, we present a highly feasible strategy for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) fiber-based textile displays that can overcome these issues by implementing prominent solution options including compatible fabrication method of OLED pixel arrays on adapted fiber configurations and chemically/mechanically sturdy but electrically conductive passivation system. To create solid interconnectable OLED fibers without compromising the high electroluminescence performance, phosphorescence OLED materials are deposited onto process-friendly fibers of rectangular stripes, where periodically patterned OLED pixels are selectively passivated with robust polymer and circumventing metal pads by a stamp-assisted printing method. A woven textile of interlaced interconnectable OLED fibers with perpendicularly arranged conductive fibers serves as a matrix-addressable two-dimensional network that can be operated by the passive matrix scheme. Successful demonstrations of stably working woven OLED textile in the water, as well as under the applied tensile force, support feasibility of the present approach to reify fully addressable, environmentally durable, fiber-based textile displays."

Removing the bezel and centralizing the camera under the screen brings larger display-to-body ratio and enhances eye contact in video chat, but also causes image degradation. In this paper, we focus on a newly-defined Under-Display Camera (UDC), as a novel real-world single image restoration problem. First, we take a 4k Transparent OLED (T-OLED) and a phone Pentile OLED (P-OLED) and analyze their optical systems to understand the degradation. Second, we design a Monitor-Camera Imaging System (MCIS) for easier real pair data acquisition, and a model-based data synthesizing pipeline to generate Point Spread Function (PSF) and UDC data only from display pattern and camera measurements. Finally, we resolve the complicated degradation using deconvolution-based pipeline and learning-based methods. Our model demonstrates a real-time high-quality restoration. The presented methods and results reveal the promising research values and directions of UDC."

The TADF material (DTPDDA) shows strong intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character with large spatial separation with the acceptor of triazine leading to narrow splitting of singlet and triplet excited states for the efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). A blue organic light emitting diode (OLED) based on DTPDDA not only displays deep blue in the Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.149, 0.197) but also exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.3% which is the highest value ever reported for a blue fluorescent OLED.

Introduction of a trimethylsilyl group at the pyridine and a nitrogen at the difluoropyrido group increases the bandgap of the emitter, resulting in deep‐blue emission. Addition of a methyl group (mpic) to a picolinate (pic) ancillary ligand or replacement of an acetate structure of pic with a perfluoromethyl‐triazole structure (fptz) increases the horizontal component of the emitting dipoles in sequence of mpic (86%) > fptz (77%) > pic (74%).

However, high-quality blue materials that can fulfill the requirements of OLED commercialization are much rare. Herein, two novel blue luminogens, 9-(4-(2,6-di- tert-butyl-10-(4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)phenyl)anthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-9 H-carbazole and 9-(4-(2,6-di- tert-butyl-10-(4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)phenyl)anthracen-9-yl)1,3-di(9 H-carbazol-9-yl)benzene (TPE-TADC), consisting of anthracene, tetraphenylethene, and carbazole groups are successfully prepared, and their thermal, optical, electronic, and electrochemical properties are fully investigated. They exhibit prominent aggregation-induced emission property and strong blue fluorescence at ∼455 nm in neat films. Efficient nondoped OLEDs are fabricated with these blue luminogens, providing blue electroluminescence (EL) at 451 nm (CIE x, y = 0.165, 0.141) and high EL efficiencies of 6.81 cd A-1, 6.57 lm W-1, and 5.71%.

303,10.1002/adfm.201910040,2020,Blue Single‐Layer Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes Using Fluorescent Materials: A Molecular Design View Point,"Since the beginning of organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs), blue emission has attracted the most attention and many research groups worldwide have worked on the design of materials for stable and highly efficient blue OLEDs. However, almost all the high‐efficiency blue OLEDs using fluorescent materials are multilayer devices, which are constituted of a stack of organic layers to improve the injection, transport, and recombination of charges within the emissive layer. Although the technology has been mastered, it suffers from real complexity and high cost and is time‐consuming. Simplifying the multilayer structure with a single‐layer one, the simplest devices made only of electrodes and the emissive layer have appeared as an appealing strategy for this technology. However, removing the functional organic layers of an OLED stack leads to a dramatic decrease of the performance and achieving high‐efficiency blue single‐layer OLEDs requires intense research especially in terms of materials design. Herein, an exhaustive review of blue emitting fluorophores that have been incorporated in single‐layer OLEDs is reported, and the links between their electronic properties and the device performance are discussed. Thus, a structure/properties/device performance relationship map is drawn, which is of interest for the future design of organic materials."
304,10.1109/TED.2018.2888858,2019,Effects of Postannealing on the Characteristics and Reliability of Polyfluorene Organic Light-Emitting Diodes,"We studied the effects of postannealing on the performance of polyfluorene organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a pure poly(9,<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$9'$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) emissive layer. After annealing at 150 °C–200 °C, the OLED exhibited the lowest voltage and highest luminance. This correlated well with the highest crystallinity of the F8BT film, as revealed by X-ray diffraction. As the temperature was raised up to 300 °C, the voltage at 50 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> increased by 2.7 V, and the luminance decreased by 44%, whereas the device lifetime was markedly extended by as much as 13 times. The loss of crystallinity at high temperatures suggested that structural disorders were created, resulting in degraded charge transport and radiative process. Our study demonstrates the necessity of posttreatment above the glass transition temperature to obtain desirable efficiency and lifetime of solution-processed polyfluorene OLEDs."

To improve the efficiency, 4,4′-bis(9-carbazolyl)-2,2′-dimethyl-biphenyl, which has a high triplet energy, was used as the carrier-transporting host for the emissive layer. The FIrpic-based OLED exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.4%, corresponding to a current efficiency of 20.4 cd/A, and a maximum power efficiency of 10.5 lm/W. The efficiency was drastically improved compared to that of a previously reported FIrpic-based OLED.

Donor–acceptor (D–A) architecture has been proved to be an effective strategy to obtain narrow energy gap. Herein, a D–A‐type NIR fluorescent compound 2,3‐bis(4′‐(diphenylamino)‐[1,1′‐biphenyl]‐4‐yl)fumaronitrile (TPATCN) is synthesized and fully characterized. As revealed by theoretical calculations and photophysical experiments, TPATCN exerts the advantages of the relatively large dipole moment of the charge transfer state and a certain degree of orbital overlap of the local excited state. A highly mixed or hybrid local and charge transfer excited state might occur to simultaneously achieve both a large fraction of singlet formation and a high quantum efficiency in D–A system. TPATCN exhibits strong NIR fluorescence with the corresponding thin film quantum efficiency of 33% and the crystal efficiency of 72%.

Using a very simple one or two layer organic light emitting diode (OLED) structure, devices without outcoupling achieve an external quantum efficiency of 6% and photonic efficiencies of 20 cd/A. The theoretical maximum efficiency of such devices should not exceed 3.55%. Detailed photophysical characterization shows that for these anthracene based emitters 2T1≤Tn and so in this special case, triplet fusion can achieve a singlet production yield of 0.5. Indeed, delayed electroluminescence measurements show that triplet fusion contributes 59% of all singlets produced in these devices. This demonstrates that when triplet fusion becomes very efficient, fluorescent OLEDs even with very simple structures can approach an internal singlet production yield close to the theoretical absolute maximum of 62.5% and rival phosphorescent‐based OLEDs with the added advantage of much improved stability."
310,10.1021/JA049883A,2004,Carbazole compounds as host materials for triplet emitters in organic light-emitting diodes: tuning the HOMO level without influencing the triplet energy in small molecules.,"A series of novel carbazole compounds was synthesized and tested for their suitability as host for triplet emitters in an organic-light emitting diode (OLED). In these compounds, a carbazole unit is either connected to other carbazole units to form carbazole dimers and trimers or to fluorene and oxadiazole derivatives to form mixed compounds. The HOMO level of carbazole compounds can be tuned by substitution at the 3, 6, and/or 9 positions. Making oligomers by connecting carbazole molecules via their 3 (3') positions shifts the HOMO level to higher energy, while replacing alkyl groups at the 9 (9') positions by aryl groups shifts the HOMO level to lower energy. Furthermore, it has been found that the triplet energy of these compounds is determined by the presence of poly(p-phenyl) chains in the molecular structure. By identifying the longest poly(p-phenyl) chain, one can predict whether a compound will be a suitable host for a high-energy triplet emitter. An overview of HOMO levels, singlet and triplet levels, and exchange energies is given for all carbazole compounds synthesized. Finally, OLEDs employing two selected carbazole compounds as host and fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)-iridium (Ir(ppy)(3)) as guest were constructed and characterized electrically."

Researchers have studied this new OLED architecture with growing interest and have found that the current efficiency of a tandem OLED containing N EL units (N > 1) should be N times that of a conventional OLED containing only a single EL unit. Therefore, this new architecture is potentially useful for constructing high‐efficiency, high‐luminance, and long‐lifetime OLED displays and organic solid‐state lighting sources. In a tandem OLED, the intermediate connector plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the stacked EL units. The interfaces in the connector control the inner charge generation and charge injection into the adjacent EL units. Meanwhile, the transparency and the thickness of the connector affect the light output of the device. Therefore, the intermediate connector should be made to meet both the electrical and optical requirements for achieving optimal performance. Here, recent advances in the research of the tandem OLEDs is discussed, with the main focus on material selection and interface studies in the intermediate connectors, as well as the optical design of the tandem OLEDs."

Recent results have shown that OLEDs are capable of challenging standard incandescent light sources in terms of power efficiency (15 lmW –1 ), although other figures of merit, such as lifetime and color rendering, still need further improvement. Generating white light from phosphor-monomer and excimer emission has been proven effective and leads to simpler device structures than those requiring separate red, green, and blue emitters. For all types of OLED structures, careful consideration must be given to charge balance, in order to optimize light output.

Here, breaking of this limit by exploiting singlet fission in an OLED is reported. Based on the dependence of electroluminescence intensity on an applied magnetic field, it is confirmed that triplets produced by singlet fission in a rubrene host matrix are emitted as near‐infrared (NIR) electroluminescence by erbium(III) tris(8‐hydroxyquinoline) (ErQ3) after excitonic energy transfer from the “dark” triplet state of rubrene to an “emissive” state of ErQ3, leading to NIR electroluminescence with an overall exciton production efficiency of 100.8%. This demonstration clearly indicates that the harvesting of triplets produced by singlet fission as electroluminescence is possible even under electrical excitation, leading to an enhancement of the quantum efficiency of the OLEDs. Electroluminescence employing singlet fission provides a route toward developing high‐intensity NIR light sources, which are of particular interest for sensing, optical communications, and medical applications."

But it is not easy to simultaneously combine these two characteristics (high PL efficiency and high exciton utilization) into a fluorescent material. In this work, an efficient combination was achieved through two concepts of hybridized local and charge-transfer (CT) state (HLCT) and ""hot exciton"", in which the former is responsible for high PL efficiency while the latter contributes to high exciton utilization. On the basis of a tiny chemical modification in TPA-BZP, a green-light donor-acceptor molecule, we designed and synthesized CzP-BZP with this efficeient combination of high PL efficiency of η(PL) = 75% in the solid state and maximal exciton utilization efficiency up to 48% (especially, the internal quantum efficiency of η(IQE) = 35% substantially exceed 25% of spin statistics limit) in OLED.

In this paper, highly phosphorescent 2-phenylpyrimidine-based dinuclear iridium(III) complexes have been synthesized and fully characterized. Significant differences of the photophysical and electrochemical properties between the mono- and dinuclear complexes are observed. The theoretical calculation results show that the dinuclear complexes adopt a unique molecular orbital spatial distribution pattern, which plays the key role of determining their photophysical and electrochemical properties. More importantly, the solution-processed organic light-emitting diode (OLED) based on the new dinuclear iridium(III) complex achieves a peak external quantum efficiency (η(ext)) of 14.4%, which is the highest η(ext) for OLEDs using dinuclear iridium(III) complexes as emitters. Besides, the efficiencies of the OLED based on the dinuclear iridium(III) complex are much higher that those of the OLED based on the corresponding mononuclear iridium(III) complex."
326,10.1002/adfm.201400495,2014,Efficiency Enhancement of Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes Incorporating a Highly Oriented Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter,"An organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) with the blue emitter CC2TA showing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is presented exhibiting an external quantum efficiency ( ηEQE ) of 11% ± 1%, which clearly exceeds the classical limit for fluorescent OLEDs. The analysis of the emission layer by angular dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements shows a very high degree of 92% horizontally oriented transition dipole moments. Excited states lifetime measurements of the prompt fluorescent component under PL excitation yield a radiative quantum efficiency of 55% of the emitting species. Thus, the radiative exciton fraction has to be significantly higher than 25% due to TADF. Performing a simulation based efficiency analysis for the OLED under investigation allows for a quantification of individual contributions to the efficiency increase originating from horizontal emitter orientation and TADF. Remarkably, the strong horizontal emitter orientation leads to a light‐outcoupling efficiency of more than 30%."
327,10.1117/1.JPE.5.057611,2015,Review of recent progress in multilayer solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes,"Abstract. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have become a promising candidate for lighting and display applications. High efficiency OLEDs require a multilayer device architecture to provide exciton confinement and balance charge transport. Conventional OLEDs are made by vacuum process, and the manufacturing cost can be reduced by solution processing. However, unlike vacuum-deposited OLEDs, solution-processed multilayer OLEDs are more challenging to make. The key for multilayer solution processing is to have the layer structure which can withstand solvents used in subsequent processing. We review the materials’ strategies to make multilayer solution-processed OLEDs. Specifically, we will discuss the use of cross-linkable organic materials, metal oxides, and orthogonal solvent systems to deposit various functional layers in an OLED."

The development of blue emitters is of great significance in OLED applications as full-color displays and energy-saving lightings. The electrofluorescence using triplet energy for radiation has recently become a spotlight in the area of organic electronics. Various triplet-to-singlet conversion mechanisms have been established, including triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and “hot exciton” model with hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) excited state, and they are expected to shed light on the development on blue OLEDs. This study revolves around the recent progress in blue electrofluorescence materials utilizing triplet excitons for radiation. Owing to the page limitation, special focus is placed on small molecule-based purely organic fluorophores with breakthrough device performances. We begin with the general information of blue-emitting organic electrofluorescence devices, and then give an overview of blue fluorescence OLEDs based on different electroluminescence mechanisms, which is followed by individual molecular design strategies towards high efficiency."

The OLEDs contained the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitting dopant (4s,6s)-2,4,5,6-tetra(9H-carbazol-9-yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN). OLED degradation proceeds mainly on the basis of excited-state instability of host molecules rather than processes related to 4CzIPN. Additionally, the electrochemical instability of radical cations and anions influences long-term OLED degradation. The formation of exciton quenchers and nonradiative carrier recombination centers acts to reduce OLED luminance. These findings highlight the need for new host material development to fabricate more stable TADF-OLEDs."

Recent rapid advances in materials chemistry have enabled white OLEDs to be used for general lighting and large-area flat panel display. White OLED panel efficacy has reached 90 lm W–1, and a tandem white OLED panel has achieved a lifetime of over 100000 h at 1000 cd m–2. LG is set to launch a 55″ OLED TV in 2013, and OLEDs will be expected to make bigger breakthroughs. Although white OLED panels show superior performance, there is still much room (nearly 160 lm W–1) for improvement, in view of the theoretical limit of 248 lm W–1. To reach this objective, OLEDs need to achieve three goals: (1) high internal quantum efficiency, (2) low operation voltage, and (3) high light-outcoupling efficiency at the same time. For organic chemists creating new organic semiconductors, issues (1) and (2) are particularly important because these relate to materials chemistry. Here we review recent developments in phosphorescent OLED technology, especially from materials chemistry."

The external quantum efficiency and power efficiency are raised to 54.6% and 123.4 lm W−1 at 1000 cd m−2. An extremely small roll‐off in efficiency at high luminance is also obtained, yielding a striking value of 106.5 lm W−1 at 5000 cd m−2. In addition to a substantial increase in efficiency, this device structure simultaneously offers the superiority of angular color stability over the visible wavelength range compared to conventional OLEDs. It is anticipated that these findings could open up new opportunities to promote white OLEDs for commercial applications."

This can be achieved by shifting the charge‐transfer character from the pyridyl groups in some traditional iridium ppy‐type complexes to the electron‐withdrawing main‐group moieties and these assignments were supported by theoretical calculations. This new color tuning strategy in IrIII‐based triplet emitters using electron‐withdrawing main‐group moieties provides access to IrIII phosphors with improved electron injection/electron transporting features essential for highly efficient, color‐switchable organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). The present work furnished OLED colors spanning from bluish‐green to red (505–609 nm) with high electroluminescence efficiencies which have great potential for application in multicolor displays.

The high performance (EQE = 25%) and long device operational lifetime (LT95 = 5,280 h) achieved in an OLED with tetradentate Au(III) TADF emitter reflect the competitiveness of this class of emitters for use in OLEDs with practical interest.

337,10.1002/adma.200802034,2009,Nearly 100% Internal Quantum Efficiency in an Organic Blue‐Light Electrophosphorescent Device Using a Weak Electron Transporting Material with a Wide Energy Gap,"High efﬁciency in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) is a crucial factor to promote the application of OLEDs in the next generation of ﬂat panel displays. In an OLED, the generation of light is the consequence of the recombination of holes with electrons within the organic emitting material (EM) injected from the electrodes. Therefore, the efﬁciency of an OLED is composed of the recombination efﬁciency of holes with electrons and the photoluminescence quantum yield of the EM. Based on the conventional layered structure of an OLED, an emission extraction efﬁciency of 1/(2 n 2 ) can be obtained (where n is the refractive index of the organic material, which is about 1.6 [1] ). In the case of a ﬂuorescent emitter, 25% of internal quantum efﬁciency (IQE, which corresponds to (cid:1) 5% of an external quantum efﬁciency (EQE)) can be obtained from the 25% of singlet spin states. When a phosphorescent emitter is applied, the remainder 75% of triplet spin states can also emit light. Therefore, an IQE of 100% (which corresponds to (cid:1) 20% of EQE) can theoretically be obtained. [2] In fact, (87 (cid:2) 7)% of an IQE (which corresponds to about 19% of an EQE) was obtained in a green-light electrophosphorescent device using a phosphorescent dye, bis(2-phenylpyridinato)iridium( III ) acetylacetonate [(ppy) 2 Ir (acac)], as the emitter.

338,10.1002/adma.201706768,2018,Long‐Lived Flexible Displays Employing Efficient and Stable Inverted Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes,"Although organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising for use in applications such as in flexible displays, reports of long‐lived flexible OLED‐based devices are limited due to the poor environmental stability of OLEDs. Flexible substrates such as plastic allow ambient oxygen and moisture to permeate into devices, which degrades the alkali metals used for the electron‐injection layer in conventional OLEDs (cOLEDs). Here, the fabrication of a long‐lived flexible display is reported using efficient and stable inverted OLEDs (iOLEDs), in which electrons can be effectively injected without the use of alkali metals. The flexible display employing iOLEDs can emit light for over 1 year with simplified encapsulation, whereas a flexible display employing cOLEDs exhibits almost no luminescence after only 21 d with the same encapsulation. These results demonstrate the great potential of iOLEDs to replace cOLEDs employing alkali metals for use in a wide variety of flexible organic optoelectronic devices."

PHCz2BP is not only the neat emitting layer for efficient sky‐blue OLED, with very high peak external quantum efficiency/power efficiency (EQE/PE) values of 4.0%/6.9 lm W−1, but also acts as a host to sensitize high‐luminance and high‐efficiency green, orange, and red electrophosphorescence with the universal high EQEs of >20%. More importantly, two hybrid white OLEDs based on the double‐layer emitting system of PHCz2BP:green phosphor/PHCz2BP:red phosphor are achieved. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report for three‐color (blue–green–red) white devices that adopt a TADF blue host emitter and two phosphorescent dopants without any other additional host. Such simple emitting systems thus realized the best electroluminescent performance to date for the WOLEDs utilizing the hybrid TADF/phosphor strategy: forward‐viewing EQEs of 25.1/23.6% and PEs of 24.1/22.5 lm W−1 at the luminance of 1000 cd m−2 with the color rendering indexes of 85/87 and warm‐white Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.41, 0.46)/(0.42, 0.45), indicating its potential to be used as practical eye‐friendly solid‐state lighting in future."

Here, we utilize chemically derived graphene for the transparent cathode in an all-plastic sandwich-structure device, similar to an OLED, called a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC).

Oxide semiconductor-based thin-ﬁlm transistors (TFTs) have been extensively studied mainly to replace Si-based TFTs in electrical and optical devices. [1–5] Therefore, there have been many reports on oxide-based TFTs: transparent oxide TFTs, [6–10] amorphous oxide TFTs, [11–15] polycrystalline oxide TFTs, [16,17] and even photo-detecting oxide TFTs. [18] In particular, transparent ZnO-TFTs have attracted much attention as display drivers that possess some evident advantages over opaque Si-based TFTs. [19] Transparent TFTs (TTFTs) with a large energy bandgap channel of (cid:1) 3.3eV would transmit a visible light signal to increase the aperture ratio even in the bottom emission OLED display, which could not be anticipated from any conventional opaque TFTs. Well-designed TTFTs would result in important beneﬁts such as longer life time and lower fabrication price of OLEDs or TFT-LCDs. However, since the ZnO-TFTs usually contain defects in the ZnO channel and deep level defects in the channel/dielectric interface that generate unwanted photo-current during light transmission and device operation, [20,21] the very advantages of the transparent ZnO-TFTs have never been fully utilized or demonstrated for display panels, to the best of our limited knowledge.

343,10.1098/rsta.2014.0321,2015,Triplet–triplet annihilation in highly efficient fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes: current state and future outlook,"Studies of delayed electroluminescence in highly efficient fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) of many dissimilar architectures indicate that the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) significantly increases yield of excited singlet states—emitting molecules in this type of device thereby contributes substantially to their efficiency. Towards the end of the 2000s, the essential role of TTA in realizing highly efficient fluorescent devices was widely recognized. Analysis of a diverse set of fluorescent OLEDs shows that high efficiencies are often cor-related to TTA extents. It is therefore likely that it is the long-term empirical optimization of OLED efficiencies that has resulted in fortuitous emergence of TTA as a large and ubiquitous contributor to efficiency. TTA contributions as high as 20–30% are common in the state-of-the-art OLEDs, and even become dominant in special cases, where TTA is shown to substantially exceed the spin-statistical limit. The fundamental features of OLED efficiency enhancement via TTA—molecular structure-dependent contributions, current density-dependent intensities in practical devices and frequently observed antagonistic relationships between TTA extent and OLED lifetime—came to be understood over the course of the next few years. More recently, however, there was much less reported progress with respect to all-important quantitative details of the TTA mechanism. It should be emphasized that, to this day and despite the decades of work on improving blue phosphorescent OLEDs as well as the recent advent of thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs, the majority of practical blue OLEDs still rely on TTA. Considering such practical importance of fluorescent blue OLEDs, the design of blue OLED-compatible materials capable of substantially exceeding the spin-statistical limit in TTA, elimination of the antagonistic relationship between TTA-related efficiency gains and lifetime losses, and designing devices with an extended range of current densities producing near-maximum TTA electroluminescence are the areas where future improvements would be most beneficial."

Tin‐doped indium oxide (ITO) is the standard anode in industry. However, due to the scarcity of indium, alternative anodes that eliminate its use are highly desired. Here an indium‐free anode is developed by a combinatorial study of zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin oxide (SnO2), both composed of earth‐abundant elements. The optimized Zn–Sn–O (ZTO) films have electron mobilities of up to 21 cm2 V−1 s−1, a conductivity of 245 S cm−1, and <5% absorptance in the visible range of the spectrum. The high electron mobilities and low surface roughness (<0.2 nm) are achieved by producing dense and void‐free amorphous layers as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. These ZTO layers are evaluated for OLEDs in two anode configurations: i) 10 cm2 devices with ZTO/Ag/ZTO and ii) 41 cm2 devices with ZTO plus a metal grid. The ZTO layers are compatible with OLED processing steps and large‐area white OLEDs fabricated with the ZTO/grid anode show better performance than those with ITO/grid anodes. These results confirm that ZTO has the potential as an In‐free and Earth‐abundant alternative to ITO for large‐area flexible OLEDs."

For example, Lee and Lee [ 14 ] reported an iridium(III) bis[(4,6-difl uorophenyl)-pyridinate-N,C2 ′ ]picolinate (FIrpic)based blue OLED with an EQE of 30% at 100 cd m −2 using a pyrido[2,3-b]indole derivative as a host material. However, the driving voltages at 100 cd m −2 are very high (over 4.5 V) compared with those of low-drive-voltage green devices. [ 15,16 ] Shin et al. [ 17a ] reported a FIrpic-based OLED with an EQE of 29.5% using an exciplex-forming co-host system. However, the driving voltages at 1000 cd m −2 are relatively high at around 5.0 V. Very recently, Lee et al. [ 17b ] further reduced the driving voltage of this exciplex system by changing the electron-transport layer (ETL) from B3PyMPM to PO-T2T. Therefore, reducing the drive voltage at high brightness is a critical issue in blue OLEDs. Recently, Lee et al. [ 18 ] reported a low-driving-voltage blue device using a mixed-host system consisting of two host materials: 2-(diphenylphosphoryl)spirofl uorene (SPPO1) as an n-type host material and 4,4,4-tris( N -carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA) as a p-type host material. The mixed-host device showed two times higher EQE than a single-host device with SPPO1 at the high-luminance region over 1000 cd m −2 . The mixed-host device also realized a low driving voltage of 3.9 V at 1000 cd m −2 . Therefore, the use of a mixed-host system represents a promising method to realize a low drive voltage and high EQE at high brightness. In this study, we realized a high EQE of 30%, a low drive voltage, and a low effi ciency roll-off at the high-brightness region (>1000 cd m −2 ) in blue OLEDs using a mixed-host system. We used two types of host materials: TCTA as a p-type host material and 2,6-bis(3-(carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)pyridine (26DCzPPy) as an n-type host material. Consequently, the mixed-host device gave a high-performance blue OLED with a driving voltage of 3.25 V, an EQE of 32.6%, and a power effi ciency of 77.6 lm W −1 at 1000 cd m −2 without any enhancement in light outcoupling. We also developed a white OLED based on this blue device and iridium(III) bis-(2-phenylquinolyN , C 2 ′ ) dipivaloylmethane [PQ 2 Ir(dpm)] as an orange emitter. The white OLED achieved a driving voltage of 3.35 V and an EQE of 24.4% at 1000 cd m −2 . Very recently, we have reported a blue OLED with a driving voltage of 3.0 V and an EQE of 30% at 100 cd m −2 .

This work focuses on the degradation phenomena of OLEDs that are based on sky‐blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters and clarifies the degradation mechanisms based on spectral change of the electroluminescence, which indicates the formation of electromer emission from an electron transport layer. Additionally, it is determined that the change in the carrier balance that occurs during this degradation process can be ascribed to the formation of electron traps."

In particular, to choose an appropriate process to produce OLEDs to meet the demands of a realistic situation, it is necessary to know the general advantages and disadvantages of vacuum- and solution-processed films quantitatively. However, the differences between the films formed by these processes are not yet sufficiently clear. Here we systematically compare vacuum-deposited and spin-coated amorphous organic semiconductor films used for OLEDs mainly by ellipsometry, and demonstrate the critical differences in film density, transition temperature, and molecular orientation. We found that the film density, transition temperature, and degree of horizontal molecular orientation of small-molecule spin-coated films are inherently lower than those of the corresponding vacuum-deposited ones. In addition, we show that the transition temperature and molecular orientation of small-molecule spin-coated films of glassy materials are identical to those of “deteriorated” vacuum-deposited films that have experienced a transition induced by heating. Our comprehensive comparisons lead to guidelines for selecting suitable processes and materials for production and clarify the future challenges to be addressed to facilitate the development of high-performance solution-processed OLEDs."

Here, we present a transparent electrode based on a dual-scale silver nanowire (AgNW) percolation network embedded in a flexible substrate to demonstrate a significant enhancement in the effective electrical area by filling the large percolative voids present in a long/thick AgNW network with short/thin AgNWs. As a proof of concept, the performance enhancement of a flexible phosphorescent OLED is demonstrated with the dual-scale AgNW percolation network compared to the previous mono-scale AgNWs. Moreover, we report that mechanical and oxidative robustness, which are critical for flexible OLEDs, are greatly increased by embedding the dual-scale AgNW network in a resin layer."
351,10.1002/adma.200700641,2007,Harvesting Triplet Excitons from Fluorescent Blue Emitters in White Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes,"A novel concept for white organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling the utilization of all electrically generated excitons for light generation and achieving a high luminance at very low voltage is introduced. The key feature is a fluorescent blue emitter with high triplet energy, rendering it possible to harvest its triplet excitons by letting them diffuse to an orange phosphorescent iridium complex. This results in a total internal quantum efficiency of almost unity. The high potential of this concept is demonstrated in that a total external power efficiency of 57.6 lm W –1 at a brightness of 100 Cdm –2 (20.3% external quantum efficiency) and 37.5 lmW –1 (16.1%) at 1000 Cdm –2 were achieved.

To address this issue, herein, three tailored n‐type light emitters comprised of 2,3,4,5‐tetraphenylsilole and dimesitylboryl functional groups are designed and synthesized. The new siloles are fully characterized by standard spectroscopic and crystallographic methods with satisfactory results. Their thermal stabilities, electronic structures, photophysical properties, electrochemical behaviors and applications in OLEDs are investigated. These new siloles exhibit AIE characteristics with high emission efficiencies in solid films, and possess lower LUMO energy levels than their parents, 2,3,4,5‐tetraphenylsiloles. The double‐layer OLEDs [ITO/NPB (60 nm)/silole (60 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm)] fabricated by adopting the new siloles as both light emitter and electron transporter afford excellent performances, with high electroluminescence efficiencies up to 13.9 cd A–1, 4.35% and 11.6 lm W–1, which are increased greatly relative to those attained from the triple‐layer devices with an additional electron‐transporting layer.

To improve this outcoupling efficiency, we have developed a new thin (∼2 μm) light scattering layer that employs air voids (low-index scattering centers) embedded in a high-index polyimide matrix to effectively frustrate the substrate-trapped light, increasing the outcoupling efficiency.

356,10.1002/ADMA.200700134,2007,Nanoimprinted Semitransparent Metal Electrodes and Their Application in Organic Light‐Emitting Diodes,"Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising for full-color, full-motion, flat panel display applications because they offer several advantageous features, for example, ease of fabrication, low costs, light weight, bright self-emission, a wide viewing angle, and the possibility of flexible displays. The basic OLED structure consists of a number of organic semiconductor layers sandwiched between a cathode and an anode. For efficient electron injection into the organic layers, low-work-function materials are required for the cathode. A very thin LiF layer with a thick Al capping is widely used for this purpose. For the anode, indium tin oxide (ITO) is the predominant choice because it offers transparency in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as electrical conductivity. However, several aspects of ITO are far from optimal for high-performance OLEDs. It is known that the migration of indium and oxygen from ITO into organic semiconductors during OLED operation causes device degradation. The electrical properties of ITO greatly depend on the film preparation. The rough surface of the deposited ITO film and the work function of ITO, ca. 4.7 eV, limit the efficiency of the hole injection. The typical sheet resistance of a 100 nm thick ITO layer, 20–80 X/ , is still high, which causes a voltage drop along the addressing line, thus limiting the operation of a large-area passive matrix OLED array. Moreover, the cost of ITO has escalated in recent years because of the jump in price of the element indium. Several alternative materials, for example, TiN, Al-doped ZnO, and fluorine tin oxide, have been investigated as anode materials instead of ITO; however, none are optimal as anode in OLEDs because they have either a lower work function or a lower conductivity than ITO. Other transparent conducting oxides, such as Ga–In–Sn–O (GITO), Zn–In–Sn–O (ZITO), Ga–In–O (GIO), and Zn–In–O (ZIO), that have a higher work function and a similar electrical conductivity when compared to ITO have also been examined as OLED anode materials. However, they are potentially problematic because they also contain the element indium that i) may diffuse into the organic layer in the OLED; and ii) has a high price, making these electrodes expensive. Besides these materials several metals with a high work function, such as Au, Ni, and Pt, have been investigated as anodes for OLEDs. In these cases the metal was used to modify the surface of the ITO electrode, or as an anode for top-emitting devices. A surface-modified thin Ag film has been used as a semitransparent electrode instead of ITO, but its transparency was low. Recently, carbon nanotube films have been investigated as transparent, conductive electrodes, but they have a high sheet resistance that may limit the device performance. In this Communication, we report semitransparent metal electrodes fabricated by nanoimprint lithography (NIL), and evaluate their potential as OLED anodes. NIL, an emerging lithographic technique, is well-suited to the area of organic electronics, which requires low-cost and high-throughput fabrication at high resolution. The fabricated semitransparent metal electrode offers several advantages over ITO for OLED applications. First, several problems associated with ITO can be eliminated, such as device degradation by indium diffusion and high costs. Second, efficient hole injection into the organic semiconductor can be realized by choosing metals with a high work function, such as Au or Pt. Third, a semitransparent metal electrode is potentially suitable for topemitting devices and tandem structures. Last, but not least, the output efficiency of the OLED can be enhanced by preventing waveguiding in the ITO layer, which occurs as a result of its high refractive index and is one of the limitations to the external efficiency of OLEDs, and by forming a two-dimensional (2D) hole array with proper periodicity. We demonstrate here that a unique property of such an electrode is that its optical transparency and the electrical conductivity can be tuned separately by changing the aperture ratio and the metal thickness, thereby making it possible to tailor the structures for different applications. To our knowledge, a nanoimprinted semitransparent metal electrode has not been reported before. The semitransparent metal electrodes are in the form of a nanometer-scale periodically perforated dense metal mesh on glass. Two design considerations led to such structures: i) the line width of the metal mesh was designed to be subwavelength, to provide sufficient transparency and to minimize light scattering; and ii) the period of the mesh was chosen to be sub-micrometer to ensure the uniformity of the current injection into the organic semiconductors. Such large-area dense nanostructures can be fabricated by NIL, which is ideal for this application because of its inherently high resolution C O M M U N IC A IO N"

Dendrimers are branched macromolecules that consist of a core, one or more dendrons, and surface groups. The different parts of the macromolecule can be selected to give the desired optoelectronic and processing properties. The first light‐emitting dendrimers were fluorescent but more recently highly efficient phosphorescent dendrimers have been developed. OLEDs containing light‐emitting dendrimers have been reported to have external quantum efficiencies of up to 16 %. The solubility of the dendrimers opens the way for simple processing and a new class of flat‐panel displays. In this Review we show how the structure of the light‐emitting dendrimers controls key features such as intermolecular interactions and charge transport, which are important for all OLED materials. The advantages of the dendrimer architecture for phosphorescent emitters and the way the structure can be varied to enhance materials performance and device design are illustrated."

Previous devices, which incorporated DNA in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), resulted in significant improvements in performance. In this work, nucleobases (NBs), constituents of DNA and RNA polymers, are investigated for integration into OLEDs. NB small molecules form excellent thin films by low‐temperature evaporation, enabling seamless integration into vacuum deposited OLED fabrication. Thin film properties of adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U) are investigated. Next, their incorporation as electron‐blocking (EBL) and hole‐blocking layers (HBL) in phosphorescent OLEDs is explored. NBs affect OLED performance through charge transport control, following their electron affinity trend: G < A < C < T < U. G and A have lower electron affinity (1.8–2.2 eV), blocking electrons but allowing hole transport. C, T, and U have higher electron affinities (2.6–3.0 eV), transporting electrons and blocking hole transport. A‐EBL‐based OLEDs achieve current and external quantum efficiencies of 52 cd A−1 and 14.3%, a ca. 50% performance increase over the baseline device with conventional EBL. The combination of enhanced performance, wide diversity of material properties, simplicity of use, and reduced cost indicate the promise of nucleobases for future OLED development."

We derive an analytical equation to correlate MPRT with the liquid crystal (LC)/OLED response time and TFT frame rate. Good agreement between our physical model and experimental results is obtained. Based on our model, we find that if the LC's response time is 2 ms or less, then its MPRT is nearly the same as that of OLED, even if OLED's response time is assumed to be 0. To achieve MPRT comparable to OLEDs, we developed an ultra-low viscosity LC mixture for the vertical alignment mode operation. The measured average gray-to-gray response time is 0.93 ms, and its MPRT at 120 Hz is 6.88 ms. In comparison, OLED's MPRT is 6.67 ms. To further shorten MPRT, we could either increase the frame rate or reduce the backlight duty ratio. Pros and cons of these approaches are discussed."
362,10.1021/acsami.6b12338,2016,Up to 100% Formation Ratio of Doublet Exciton in Deep-Red Organic Light-Emitting Diodes Based on Neutral π-Radical.,"In a neutral π-radical-based organic light-emitting diode (OLED), although the emission comes from the doublet excitons and their transition to the ground state is spin-allowed, the upper limit of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is not clear, 50% or 100%? In this work, the deep-red OLEDs based on a neutral π-radical were fabricated. Up to 100% doublet exciton formation ratio was obtained through rational designing device structure and host-guest doping system. This indicates the IQE of neutral π-radical-based OLEDs will reach 100% if the nonradiative pathways of radicals can be suppressed. The maximum external quantum efficiency of the optimized device is as high as 4.3%, which is among the highest values of deep-red/near-infrared OLEDs with nonphosphorescent materials as emitters. Our results also indicate that using partially reduced radical mixture as emitter may be a way to solve aggregation-caused quenching in radical-based OLEDs."

Because of the possibility of obtaining long-lasting, durable and energy-efficient OLEDs, researchers devote much time and effort towards the improvement of OLED technology and development of advanced OLED products. Blue light-emitting materials, especially blue phosphorescent materials, are indispensable for full-color displays and white OLED lighting. Compared with green and red light-emitting materials and devices, the blue-emitting counterparts show a relatively inferior performance in terms of color purity, luminescence efficiency and device durability.

365,10.1002/adma.200803440,2009,Al2O3/ZrO2 Nanolaminates as Ultrahigh Gas‐Diffusion Barriers—A Strategy for Reliable Encapsulation of Organic Electronics,"Adv. Mater. 2009, 21, 1845–1849 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag G Gas-diffusion barriers play an important role in many applications today, such as flat-panel displays or solar cells grown on plastic substrates. In particular, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) need efficient encapsulation because of the high sensitivity of many organic or electrode materials to moisture and oxygen, which has been demonstrated to cause device degradation and limited lifetime. Maximum allowable permeation rates for a viable encapsulant to be used in organic optoelectronics are still under debate, but it is common sense that the requirements are far more demanding than those for typical barrier films used in food or pharmacy packaging. A very commonly quoted figure for the upper limit of the water-vaportransmission rate (WVTR) in order to reach a minimum OLED lifetime of 10000 h is 10 6 gm 2 day . This value originated from an estimate of the amount of water needed to degrade the reactive cathode material. For the oxygen-transmission rate (OTR), maximum values for similar OLED lifetimes have been reported in the region of 10 –10 3 cmm 2 day . Nowadays, a very common technique is the encapsulation of organic devices with a glass or metal lid, which is applied under nitrogen atmosphere using, for example, an epoxy resin as glue. In addition, the residual moisture in the cavity between the organic device and lid is further minimized by an opaque getter material. For large-area, flexible, or transparent applications, glass-lid encapsulation is not suitable. A promising alternative is thin-film barriers of metal oxides or nitrides, such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, or SiN. These materials can be deposited by several techniques. Plasma-assisted processes, such as sputtering or plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), provide high quality films, but their typically reported OTR and WVTR values of about 0.5 cmm 2 day 1 and 0.3 gm 2 day , respectively, limited by imperfections in the films, are not sufficient for OLED applications. Moreover, efficient step coverage and conformal coating are not straightforward with these techniques. As a workaround, hybrid organic/inorganic multilayer structures have been introduced. In these, the polymeric intermediate layer levels the inorganic layer so that diffusion pathways through the entire stack of the barrier can be reduced. However, the combination of alternating nonvacuum-based polymer deposition processes and vacuum-based deposition processes is timeconsuming and costly, and therefore not really practical for production. An alternative technique that promises highly uniform thin-film coatings is atomic-layer deposition (ALD). ALD relies on the sequential exposure of the surface to be coated to a metal–organic precursor and a reactant (H2O, O3, NH3, etc.). The sequential dosing of precursors leads to a self-limiting process with concomitant precise control over thickness and homogeneity. The technique is well-established in the processing of insulating films for gate dielectrics and capacitors. ALD has the advantage of allowing the deposition of very dense films at low temperatures (<100 8C), and thus appears to be a promising technique suitable for preparing encapsulation layers on top of organic electronic devices. There are a few reports dealing with ALD-grown thin films for OLED encapsulation. Very-low permeation rates of 6.5 10 5 gm 2 day 1 at 60 8C have been reported for Al2O3 films that were grown at 120 8C. [13] However, deposition temperatures above 100 8C might be critical, because glass-transition temperatures for many functional OLED materials have been reported in this very temperature range. In this Communication, we report on thin encapsulation layers prepared by ALD at a temperature of 80 8C. Specifically, we study neat Al2O3 films as a reference, and introduce novel highly efficient permeation barriers based on so-called nanolaminate structures. A nanolaminate, in this case, is a composite film consisting of repetitively deposited ultrathin (a few nanometers thick) alternating layers of Al2O3 and ZrO2. The alternating nanolayer structure suppresses the formation of both microscopic voids and nanocrystals. As a result, the probability of the occurrence of statistical defects in the barrier structure related to permeation paths along connected voids or grain boundaries is significantly reduced.We demonstrate that nanolaminates render pinhole-free thin-film encapsulation layers suitable for large-area organic devices possible. First, the quantitative assessment of permeation rates on the order of 10 6 gm 2 day 1 for water and 10 3 cmm 2 day 1 for oxygen is very challenging and, as yet, no commercially available method can be applied in this range. Therefore, we used a very sensitive permeation-measurement technique that was introduced by Paetzold et al. The method allows the measurement"

Substitution was found to dramatically alter the photophysical properties of the dendritic TADF emitters. The introduction of tert-butyl and phenyl group endows the subG2Bs with aggregation-induced emission enhancement character by suppression of internal conversion in singlet excited states. In the meantime, the introduction of a methoxy group resulted in aggregation-caused quenching character. The device performance of the OLED, where subG2B neat films were incorporated as nondoped EMLs, was found to be highly enhanced by adopting fully solution-processed organic multilayer architecture in comparison to the devices with a vacuum-deposited electron transporting layer (ETL), achieving a maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.0%. Such improvement was attributable to the improved carrier balance via intermixing at solution-processed EML/ETL interfaces. It was also found that the post-thermal annealing of the OLED at appropriate temperatures could be beneficial to enhance OLED performance by promoting the intermixing EML/ETL interface to some extent. Our findings emphasize the potential utility of dendritic TADF emitters in the solution-processed TADF-OLED and increase the importance to manipulate dendrimer/small molecule interfaces."

The theoretical limit of operating voltage is generally believed to be equal to the energy gap, which corresponds to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for the emitter molecule divided by the electron charge (e). Here, green OLEDs operating below a theoretical limit of the energy gap (Eg) voltage with high external quantum efficiency over 20% are demonstrated using fac‐tris(2‐phenylpyridine)iridium(III) with a peak emission wavelength of 523 nm, which is equivalent to a photon energy of 2.38 eV.

Here, an improved TF‐OLED structure on a plastic substrate that achieves a device transparency over 70% and extremely efficient warm‐white emission from both sides is reported. The key feature of this device structure is the combination of transparent metal–dielectric composite electrodes, which are patterned with moth‐eye nanostructures for broadband and angle‐independent light outcoupling. By collectively reducing ohmic losses and releasing the trapped photons, the TF‐OLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 72.4% and power efficiency of 168.5 lm W−1 with a color‐rendering index over 84.

Most radiation is lost to two major channels: waveguide modes and surface plasmon polaritons. It is known that reducing the refractive indices of the constituent layers in an OLED can enhance light extraction. Among all of the layers, the refractive index of the electron transport layer (ETL) has the largest impact on light extraction because it is the layer adjacent to the metallic cathode. Oblique angle deposition (OAD) provides a way to manipulate the refractive index of a thin film by creating an ordered columnar void structure. In this work, using OAD, the refractive index of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) can be tuned from 1.75 to 1.45.

Intriguingly, with the use of low‐index electrode in the device, in addition to the known suppression of waveguided modes, the surface plasmon modes can also be effectively suppressed with larger emitter‐to‐metal distances yet with better immunity to accompanied increase of the competing waveguided modes (induced by thicker organic layers) as in the ITO device. As a result, overall coupling efficiencies of OLED internal radiation into substrates can be significantly enhanced over those with ITO electrodes. Through effective extraction of radiation within substrates, green phosphorescent OLEDs adopting both the low‐index ITO‐free electrode and the preferentially horizontal dipole emitter (with a horizontal dipole ratio of 76%) achieve a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to ≈64%. The simulation also predicts that very high EQEs of ≥80% are possible with highly horizontal dipole emitters for all red/green/blue/white OLEDs, clearly revealing the potential of combining low‐index transparent electrodes and horizontal dipole emitters for high‐efficiency OLEDs."

However, the application of the organic single crystals in light‐emitting devices (OLEDs) has been limited by single‐layered structure with unbalanced carrier injection and transport. Here, fabrication of a multilayered‐structure crystal‐based OLED constitutes a major step toward balanced carrier injection and transport by introducing an anodic buffer layer and electron transport layer into the device structure. Three primary color single‐crystal‐based OLEDs based on the multilayered structure and molecular doping exhibit a maximum luminance and current efficiency of 820 cd cm−2 and 0.9 cd A−1, respectively, which are the highest performance to date for organic single‐crystal‐based OLEDs.

The ultrathin nondoped EML was constructed by introducing a 0.1 nm thin layer of pure phosphorescent dyes between a hole transporting layer and an electron transporting layer. The maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) reached 17.1%, 20.9%, 17.3%, and 19.2% for blue, green, orange, and red monochrome OLEDs, respectively, indicating the universality of the ultrathin nondoped EML for most phosphorescent dyes. On the basis of this, simple white OLED structures are also demonstrated.

383,10.1063/1.4897534,2014,Monte Carlo study of efficiency roll-off of phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes: Evidence for dominant role of triplet-polaron quenching,"We present an advanced molecular-scale organic light-emitting diode (OLED) model, integrating both electronic and excitonic processes. Using this model, we can reproduce the measured efficiency roll-off for prototypical phosphorescent OLED stacks based on the green dye tris[2-phenylpyridine]iridium (Ir(ppy)3) and the red dye octaethylporphine platinum (PtOEP) and study the cause of the roll-off as function of the current density. Both the voltage versus current density characteristics and roll-off agree well with experimental data. Surprisingly, the results of the simulations lead us to conclude that, contrary to what is often assumed, not triplet-triplet annihilation but triplet-polaron quenching is the dominant mechanism causing the roll-off under realistic operating conditions. Simulations for devices with an optimized recombination profile, achieved by carefully tuning the dye trap depth, show that it will be possible to fabricate OLEDs with a drastically reduced roll-off. It is envisaged that J 90, the current density at which the efficiency is reduced to 90%, can be increased by almost one order of magnitude as compared to the experimental state-of-the-art."

These molecules could form a uniform thin film via the solution process and also allowed the subsequent deposition of an electron transporting layer either by vacuum deposition or by an all-solution coating method. Intriguingly, the new luminogens displayed aggregation-induced emission (AIE), which is a unique photophysical phenomenon. As a nondoped emitting layer (EML), IAcTr-in showed external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 11.8% for the hybrid-solution processed OLED and 10.9% for the all-solution processed OLED with a low efficiency roll-off. This was evident by the higher photoluminescence quantum yield and higher rate constant of reverse intersystem crossing of IAcTr-in, as compared to IAcTr-out. These AIE luminogens were used as dopants and mixed with the well-known host material 1,3-bis( N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) to produce a high-efficiency OLED with a two-component EML. The maximum EQE of 17.5% was obtained when using EML with IAcTr-out doping (25 wt %) into mCP, and the OLED with EML bearing IAcTr-in and mCP showed a higher maximum EQE of 18.4% as in the case of the nondoped EML-based device."

High efficiency is one of the key issues for their commercial applications, for which much effort has been devoted to developing novel materials and device structures. It is well known that around 80% of the generated photons are trapped in OLED structure, so that there is still the greatest scope for significant improvements in its efficiency. This has driven the research towards the integration of micro/nano patterns into device structures that benefit from their abilities in manipulating the generation and propagation of photons. Micro/nano patterns with random or periodic morphologies have demonstrated their effect on the outcoupling of the trapped photons within the device. Moreover, the emitting properties other than the light extraction could be manipulated by introducing the micro/nano patterns. This article reviews the recent progresses in improving the light extraction and manipulating the emission properties of the OLEDs through the introduction of the micro/nano patterns by various fabrication strategies. The light manipulation of the micro/nano patterns in organic photovoltaics is briefly discussed considering its similar working principle and fabrication strategies to that of the OLEDs."

Specifically, in depth investigation is performed on the ability of atomic layer deposition deposited zinc oxide (ZnO) on AgNWs to render the nanowires electrically stable during electrical stressing at the range of operational current density used for OLED lighting. ZnO‐coated AgNWs have been observed to show no electrical, optical, or morphological degradation, while pristine AgNW electrodes have become unusable for optoelectronic devices due to dramatic decreases in conductivity, transparency, and fragmentation of the nanowire network at ≈150 mA cm−2. When fabricated into OLED substrates, resulting OLEDs fabricated on the ZnO‐AgNW platform exhibit a 140% increase in lifetime when compared to OLEDs fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass, and ≈20% when compared to OLEDs fabricated on AgNW based substrates. While both ZnO‐coated and pristine AgNW substrates outperform ITO/glass due to the lower current densities required to drive the device, morphological stability in response to current stressing is responsible for the enhancement of lifetime of ZnO‐AgNW based OLEDs compared to pristine AgNW based OLEDs."

Among all the possibilities, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising smart materials due to their chemical and structural properties. Herein, for the first time, the use of a Zr‐based MOF (Zr‐NDC, NDC = dimethyl 2,6‐naphthalenedicarboxylate) as electroluminescent active material in OLED devices is reported. The results indicate that, independently of the properties of the polymer used to form the emissive layer, the OLED emission is due to radiative electron and hole recombination in the MOF. A tuning of the optoelectronic properties of the device by incorporating Coumarin 153, (C153) and 4‐(Dicyanomethylene)‐2‐methyl‐6‐(4‐dimethylaminostyryl)‐4H‐pyran, into the MOF pores is demonstrated.

It is observed that the current density as well as the electroluminescent behavior depends on the dopant fluorophores. It is also shown that defects within the Zr‐MOF play a role in the OLED optoelectronic properties. The results clearly demonstrate the potential of MOFs as new tunable electroluminescent materials for OLED applications."

Arylsilanes and siloxanes display the advantages of good solubility in common organic solvents and excellent resistance to thermal, chemical and irradiation degradations. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the utilization of arylsilanes and siloxanes as fluorophore emitters, hosts for phosphor emitters, hole and exciton blocking materials, and as electron and hole transporting materials. Finally, perspectives and challenges related to arylsilanes and siloxanes for OLED applications are proposed based on the reported progress and our own opinions."

Achieving this goal will require reimagining all the various aspects of the OLED with natural-based renewable materials. Here, we replace the common substrate, electrode, and hole injection layer in the OLED structure with cellulose, gold, and the DNA nucleobase adenine. Gold films are used as semitransparent electrodes on plant-based cellulose substrates, providing flexible anodes that are highly conductive without annealing. A lift-off fabrication method (template stripping) employed UV curable epoxy to transfer patterned gold from silicon to cellulose.

It is well documented that visible red wavelengths can accelerate wound healing in diabetic animal models and patients. In vitro and in vivo diabetic models were used to investigate the effects of organic light emitting diode (OLED) irradiation on cellular function and cutaneous wound healing. Human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in hyperglycemic medium (glucose concentration 180 mM) and irradiated with an OLED (623 nm wavelength peak, range from 560 to 770 nm, power density 7 or 10 mW/cm2 at 0.2, 1, or 5 J/cm2).

For the in vivo experiment, OLED and laser (635 ± 5 nm wavelength) treatments (10 mW/cm2, 5 J/cm2 daily for a total of seven consecutive days) for cutaneous wound healing were compared using a genetic, diabetic rat model. Both treatments had significantly higher percentage of wound closure on day 6 postinjury and higher total histological scores on day 13 postinjury compared with control. No statistical difference was found between the two treatments. OLED irradiation significantly increased fibroblast growth factor‐2 expression at 36‐hour postinjury and enhanced macrophage activation during initial stages of wound healing. In conclusion, the OLED and laser had comparative effects on enhancing diabetic wound healing."

Stable materials and the structural design of the device are important for OLED longevity. Control of charge transport and accumulation in the device is particularly important because the interaction of excitons and polarons results in material degradation. This research investigated the charge dynamics of OLEDs experimentally and by drift-diffusion modeling. Parallel capacitance–voltage measurements of devices provided knowledge of charge behavior at different driving voltages. A comparison of exciplex-forming co-host and single host structures established that the mobility balance in the emitting layers determined the amount of accumulated polarons in those layers.

This paper reports an efficient blue fluorescent OLED based on a deep-blue-emitting phosphorescent sensitizer [(dfpysipy)2Ir(mpic)] and a conventional fluorescent emitter (TBPe). Efficient triplet harvesting by the fluorescent emitter occurs in the OLED because of sensitization even though the difference in the emission energy between the phosphorescent and fluorescent emissions was only 0.05 eV. These results clearly demonstrate the potential for realizing highly efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs using phosphorescent sensitizers without requiring ultraviolet-emitting phosphorescent dye.

We study the tradeoff between the two processes from the electroluminescence transients of an OLED comprising a tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene emissive layer, whose emission spectrum peaks at a wavelength of 610 nm. The electroluminescent transients in the current density range, 4 mA/cm(2)<J<57 A/cm(2), are modeled based on singlet and triplet density dynamics. Our analysis shows that triplets positively contribute to the OLED efficiency at J<2.2 A/cm(2), while decreasing the efficiency at higher J. The high OLED peak external quantum efficiency of 6.7% and rapid efficiency roll-off with J are quantitatively explained by the tradeoff between triplet-triplet and singlet-triplet annihilation. The model suggests optimal materials properties needed for achieving high efficiency at high brightness in fluorescent OLEDs."

Strong TTA is observed in host:guest systems in which the dopant has a limited charge‐trapping capability. On the other hand, systems in which the dopant can efficiently trap charges show insignificant TTA, an effect that is due, in part, to the efficient quenching of triplet excitons by the trapped charges. Fluorescent host:guest systems with the strongest TTA are found to give the highest OLED electroluminescence efficiency, a phenomenon attributed to the role of TTA in converting triplet excitons into additional singlet excitons, thus appreciably contributing to the light output of OLEDs. The results shed light on and give direct evidence for the phenomena behind the recently reported very high efficiencies attainable in fluorescent host:guest OLEDs with quantum efficiencies exceeding the classical 25% theoretical limit."

One key challenge of high-performance inverted OLED is an efficient electron-injection layer with superior electrical and optical properties to match the indium tin oxide cathode on substrate. We here propose a synergistic electron-injection architecture using surface modification of ZnO layer to simultaneously promote electron injection into organic emitter and enhance out-coupling of waveguided light. An efficient inverted white OLED is realized by introducing the nanoimprinted aperiodic nanostructure of ZnO for broadband and angle-independent light out-coupling and inserting an n-type doped interlayer for energy level tuning and injection barrier lowering. As a result, the optimized inverted white OLEDs have an external quantum efficiency of 42.4% and a power efficiency of 85.4 lm W1-, which are accompanied by the superiority of angular color stability over the visible wavelength range. Our results may inspire a promising approach to fabricate high-efficiency inverted OLEDs for large-scale display panels."

We also show that the performance of the printed devices can be improved via postprinting thermal annealing, and that the external quantum efficiency of the printed devices is comparable with the efficiency of the vacuum-deposited OLEDs. Our results suggest that the PUA-based contact printing can be used as an alternative to the traditional shadow mask deposition, permitting manufacturing of OLED displays with the resolution up to the diffraction limit of visible-light emission."

It was found that excitation energy of an exciplex formed between an electron-transporting material with a π-deficient quinoxaline moiety and a hole-transporting material with aromatic amine structure can be effectively transferred to a phosphorescent iridium complex in an emission layer of a phosphorescent OLED. Moreover, such an exciplex formation increases quantum efficiency and reduces drive voltage. A highly efficient, low-voltage, and long-life OLED based on this energy transfer is also demonstrated. This OLED device exhibited extremely high external quantum efficiency of 31% even without any attempt to enhance light outcoupling and also achieved a low drive voltage of 2.8 V and a long lifetime of approximately 1,000,000 h at a luminance of 1,000 cd/m2."
406,10.1039/C3TC32301C,2014,Highly efficient single-layer organic light-emitting devices based on a bipolar pyrazine/carbazole hybrid host material,"Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted tremendous interest and have already become a prevalent technology in MP3 players, smartphones and cameras. In response to the calls for the large-scale application of OLEDs, the complicated and costly processes for preparing a device is a major challenge which should be addressed. Herein, a novel bipolar host material, 26PyzCz, which contains a pyrazine/carbazole hybrid, has been designed and synthesized. 26PyzCz-based single-layer (SL) fluorescent (F)–phosphorescent (P) OLEDs with various colors have been successfully fabricated. Green and orange SL phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) have exhibited efficiencies as high as 63.3 and 62.1 cd A−1 at 1000 cd m−2, and 55.7 and 53.8 cd A−1 at 10 000 cd m−2, respectively. Meanwhile, a SL warm white OLED based on fluorescent blue and phosphorescent orange has demonstrated excellent performance, with a maximum current efficiency of 27.5 cd A−1 and a maximum power efficiency of 21.6 lm W−1. In addition, the charge carrier behavior have been evaluated by impedance spectroscopy, which revealed that the dopant trapping effect plays a critical role in charge balance and exciton generation in the SL PHOLEDs."
407,10.1002/adfm.200600651,2007,Solution‐Processed Full‐Color Polymer Organic Light‐Emitting Diode Displays Fabricated by Direct Photolithography,"The first full‐color polymer organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) display is reported, fabricated by a direct photolithography process, that is, a process that allows direct structuring of the electroluminescent layer of the OLED by exposure to UV light. The required photosensitivity is introduced by attaching oxetane side groups to the backbone of red‐, green‐, and blue‐light‐emitting polymers. This allows for the use of photolithography to selectively crosslink thin films of these polymers. Hence the solution‐based process requires neither an additional etching step, as is the case for conventional photoresist lithography, nor does it rely on the use of prestructured substrates, which are required if ink‐jet printing is used to pixilate the emissive layer. The process allows for low‐cost display fabrication without sacrificing resolution: Structures with features in the range of 2 μm are obtained by patterning the emitting polymers via UV illumination through an ultrafine shadow mask. Compared to state‐of‐the‐art fluorescent OLEDs, the display prototype (pixel size 200 μm × 600 μm) presented here shows very good efficiency as well as good color saturation for all three colors. The application in solid‐state lighting is also possible: Pure white light [Commision Internationale de l'Éclairage (CIE) values of 0.33, 0.33 and color rendering index (CRI) of 76] is obtained at an efficiency of 5 cd A–1 by mixing the three colors in the appropriate ratio. For further enhancement of the device efficiency, an additional hole‐transport layer (HTL), which is also photo‐crosslinkable and therefore suitable to fabricate multilayer devices from solution, is embedded between the anode and the electroluminescent layer."
408,10.3390/ELECTRONICS3010190,2014,Emerging Transparent Conducting Electrodes for Organic Light Emitting Diodes,"Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted much attention in recent years as next generation lighting and displays, due to their many advantages, including superb performance, mechanical flexibility, ease of fabrication, chemical versatility, etc. In order to fully realize the highly flexible features, reduce the cost and further improve the performance of OLED devices, replacing the conventional indium tin oxide with better alternative transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) is a crucial step. In this review, we focus on the emerging alternative TCE materials for OLED applications, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metallic nanowires, conductive polymers and graphene. These materials are selected, because they have been applied as transparent electrodes for OLED devices and achieved reasonably good performance or even higher device performance than that of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass. Various electrode modification techniques and their effects on the device performance are presented. The effects of new TCEs on light extraction, device performance and reliability are discussed. Highly flexible, stretchable and efficient OLED devices are achieved based on these alternative TCEs. These results are summarized for each material. The advantages and current challenges of these TCE materials are also identified."
409,10.1364/OE.22.007524,2014,Coherent mode coupling in highly efficient top-emitting OLEDs on periodically corrugated substrates.,"Bragg scattering at one-dimensional corrugated substrates allows to improve the light outcoupling from top-emitting organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The OLEDs rely on a highly efficient phosphorescent pin stack and contain metal electrodes that introduce pronounced microcavity effects. A corrugated photoresist layer underneath the bottom electrode introduces light scattering. Compared to optically optimized reference OLEDs without the corrugated substrate, the corrugation increases light outcoupling efficiency but does not adversely affect the electrical properties of the devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is increased from 15 % for an optimized planar layer structure to 17.5 % for a corrugated OLED with a grating period of 1.0 μm and a modulation depth of about 70 nm. Detailed analysis and optical modeling of the angular resolved emission spectra of the OLEDs provide evidence for Bragg scattering of waveguided and surface plasmon modes that are normally confined within the OLED stack into the air-cone. We observe constructive and destructive interference between these scattered modes and the radiative cavity mode. This interference is quantitatively described by a complex summation of Lorentz-like resonances."
410,10.1063/1.2133922,2005,Physical mechanism responsible for the stretched exponential decay behavior of aging organic light-emitting diodes,"The main process responsible for the luminance degradation in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) driven under constant current has not yet been identified. In this paper, we propose an approach to describe the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the OLED aging. We first show that a stretched exponential decay can be used to fit almost all the luminance versus time curves obtained under different driving conditions. In this way, we are able to prove that they can all be described by employing a single free parameter model. By using an approach based on local relaxation events, we will demonstrate that a single mechanism is responsible for the dominant aging process. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that the main relaxation event is the annihilation of one emissive center. We then use our model to fit all the experimental data measured under different driving condition, and show that by carefully fitting the accelerated luminance lifetime-curves, we can extrapolate the low-luminance lifetime needed for real..."
411,10.1063/1.3043800,2008,Light extraction and optical loss mechanisms in organic light-emitting diodes: Influence of the emitter quantum efficiency,"The internal quantum efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) can reach values close to 100% if phosphorescent emitters to harvest triplet excitons are used; however, the fraction of light that is actually leaving the device is considerably less. Loss mechanisms are, for example, waveguiding in the organic layers and the substrate as well as the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons at metallic electrodes. Additionally, absorption in the organic layers and the electrodes can play a role. In this work we use numerical simulations to identify and quantify different loss mechanisms. Changing simulation parameters, for example, the distance of the emitter material to the cathode or thicknesses of the various layers, enables us to study their influence on the fraction of light leaving the OLED. An important parameter in these simulations and for the actual device is the radiative quantum efficiency q, which is defined as the efficiency of radiative exciton decay in an unbounded space filled by th..."

A phosphorescent OLED not containing an air-sensitive material was fabricated by employing an inverted structure with an air-stable electron injection layer. Efficient electron injection from the bottom cathode to the emitting layer was demonstrated from the fact that the device characteristics of the inverted OLED were almost the same as those of a conventional OLED. No dark spot formation was observed after 250 days in the inverted OLED encapsulated by a barrier film with a water vapor transmission rate of 10−4 g m−2 day−1.

The periodic modulation converts the guided waves in the high-refractive-index indium-tin-oxide/organic layers into external leaky waves. We used the finite-difference time-domain method to optimize the structural parameters of the photonic crystal pattern and to analyze the microcavity effect by the metallic cathode of the OLED. With the use of an optimized photonic crystal pattern, an increase of over 80% in the extraction efficiency of the OLED is expected theoretically. An increase in the extraction efficiency of over 50% was achieved experimentally, without detriment to the crucial electrical properties of the OLED."
415,10.1002/adma.200700454,2008,Tandem Organic Light‐Emitting Diode using Hexaazatriphenylene Hexacarbonitrile in the Intermediate Connector,"Organic light-emitting diodes have been attracting a great deal of attention because they are useful for applications as next-generation displays and for solid-state lighting. [1,2] An OLED is actually a current-driven device, and its luminance increases with increasing current density. However, the operational lifetime of an OLED decreases with increasing current density. [3] In order to achieve high brightness, an OLED must be operated at a relatively high current density, but this will result in a short lifetime. Thus, it is crucial to improve the luminous efficiency of an OLED while operating at the lowest possible current density consistent with the intended luminance requirement to increase the operational lifetime. In order to dramatically improve the luminous efficiency and to increase the lifetimes of OLEDs, a tandem (or stacked) OLED structure can be fabricated. This is accomplished by vertically stacking several individual electroluminescent (EL) units, each with a hole-transporting layer (HTL)/light-emitting layer (LEL)/electron-transporting layer (ETL) structure, with the entire device driven by a single power source. [4–20] In a tandem OLED with N EL units (N > 1), the luminous efficiency can be about N times as high as that of a conventional OLED that contains only one EL unit (the drive voltage will also be about N times as high as that of the conventional OLED). Therefore, the tandem OLED needs only about 1/N times the current density used in the conventional OLED to obtain the same luminance, which results in an operational lifetime N times that of the conventional OLED. Alternatively, the tandem OLED can achieve a luminance N times higher than that of the conventional OLED while maintaining about the same lifetime. In a tandem OLED, all of the EL units are electrically connected in series by inserting an intermediate connector (or connecting unit) between adjacent EL units. The intermediate connector plays an important role in the function of tandem OLEDs. The intermediate connector can be formed using a metal–metal (or metal oxide) bilayer, [4,11] an organic–metal (or metal oxide) bilayer, [5,6,7,9,10,12–14,16,17] or an organic–organic bilayer. [6,8,15,18–20] Using a metal or a metal oxide in an intermediate connector can introduce fabrication complexity. Many kinds of metals and metal oxides cannot be deposited by thermal evaporation at a temperature below 300 °C; hence, methods for their deposition are not usually compatible with the underlying organic layers. Additionally, metals and some metal oxides can cause pixel crosstalk in dot-matrix displays and low optical transparency. In contrast, organic–organic intermediate connectors can be formed using thermal evaporation methods with relatively low evaporation temperatures, and they do not cause pixel crosstalk or low optical transparency. In the organic–organic intermediate connector, the first organic layer is an n-type doped organic layer, such as an alkali metal-doped ETL. The second organic layer is a p-type doped organic layer, such as an FeCl3 or 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) doped HTL. [6,8,15,18–20]"
416,10.1002/adom.201300241,2013,Highly Efficient Color Stable Inverted White Top‐Emitting OLEDs with Ultra‐Thin Wetting Layer Top Electrodes,"In addition, these approaches attempt to compensate drawbacks introduced by a non-optimized semitransparent top contact without enhancing the optical properties of the contact itself. Here, we focus on improving the characteristics of the top electrode by employing a multi-layer thin fi lm metal electrode comprising an ultra-thin MoO 3 ‐Au wetting layer system below the actual Ag electrode. Compared to conventional, thicker metal top contacts, these electrodes feature considerably increased transmittance, while providing a comparable sheet resistance thus achieving a performance similar to ITO bottom contacts. In the past, multi-layer electrodes based on thick metal layers have already shown potential for electrode optimizations in non-inverted OLEDs. [ 10,15 ] To demonstrate the full potential of our wetting layer metal electrode system in terms of optical and electrical properties, it has been integrated into an inverted tandem white top-emitting OLED stack that provides high external quantum effi ciency (EQE). Especially for display applications, the use of such inverted stacks is often favorable due to the preferred use of n-doped silicon in the backplane electronics. The bottom-emitting reference OLEDs are based on the same stack but in noninverted geometry. This structure represents a highly effi cient, state-of-the-art OLED layout. [ 16,17 ]"

418,10.1021/am301703a,2012,Solution-processed small molecules as mixed host for highly efficient blue and white phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes.,"The widely used hole-transporting host 4,4',4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)-triphenylamine (TCTA) blended with either a hole-transporting or an electron-transporting small-molecule material as a mixed-host was investigated in the phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated by the low-cost solution-process. The performance of the solution-processed OLEDs was found to be very sensitive to the composition of the mixed-host systems. The incorporation of the hole-transporting 1,1-bis[(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC) into TCTA as the mixed-host was demonstrated to greatly reduce the driving voltage and thus enhance the efficiency due to the improvement of hole injection and transport. On the basis of the mixed-host of TCTA:TAPC, we successfully fabricated low driving voltage and high efficiency blue and white phosphorescent OLEDs. A maximum forward viewing current efficiency of 32.0 cd/A and power efficiency of 25.9 lm/W were obtained in the optimized mixed-host blue OLED, which remained at 29.6 cd/A and 19.1 lm/W at the luminance of 1000 cd/m(2) with a driving voltage as low as 4.9 V. The maximum efficiencies of 37.1 cd/A and 32.1 lm/W were achieved in a single emissive layer white OLED based on the TCTA:TAPC mixed-host. Even at 1000 cd/m(2), the efficiencies still reach 34.2 cd/A and 23.3 lm/W and the driving voltage is only 4.6 V, which is comparable to those reported from the state-of-the-art vacuum-evaporation deposited white OLEDs."

420,10.1039/C4TC02875A,2015,Highly efficient and stable tandem organic light-emitting devices based on HAT-CN/HAT-CN:TAPC/TAPC as a charge generation layer,"We demonstrated an effective charge-generation layer (CGL) composition consisting of three layers: an organic acceptor material 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN), HAT-CN blended with an organic donor material 4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)benzenamine] (TAPC) and TAPC, to fabricate a high efficiency tandem organic light-emitting diode (OLED). The utilization of the HAT-CN: TAPC blending layer between HAT-CN and TAPC in a CGL greatly enhances charge generation and separation, which was found by carrying out current–voltage analyses. This means that the three-layer structure is more suitable as a connecting unit for the fabrication of high efficiency tandem OLEDs. Clearly, the tandem OLEDs based on HAT-CN/HAT-CN:TAPC/TAPC as CGL showed more than double enhancement in current efficiency with respect to the corresponding single-unit device, which is also higher than that of tandem OLEDs with HAT-CN/TAPC as CGL. More encouragingly, the power efficiency of tandem OLEDs with the new CGL was enhanced by about 1.3–1.5 times, reaching 113 lm W −1 at 1000 cd m−2 brightness as compared to 76 lm W−1 from the single-unit OLEDs and 86 lm W−1 from the HAT-CN/TAPC-based tandem OLEDs. The tandem OLEDs with the new CGL also showed good stability, at least enhancing 4.5 times compared with the single unit devices. Furthermore, three-unit tandem OLEDs based on this new CGL were also fabricated. The maximum current efficiency reached 286 cd A−1 and was maintained at 266 cd A−1 at a luminance of 10000 cd m−2."
421,10.1063/1.1531231,2003,Nonradiative recombination centers and electrical aging of organic light-emitting diodes: Direct connection between accumulation of trapped charge and luminance loss,"Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are attractive for display applications because of their high brightness, low driving voltage, and tunable color. Their operating lifetimes, hundreds or thousands of hours, are sufficient for only a limited range of applications. The luminance efficiency decreases gradually as the device is operated (electrically aged), for reasons that are poorly understood. A prototypical OLED has the structure anode|HTL|ETL|cathode, where the HTL and ETL are hole- and electron-transporting layers, and the recombination and emission occur at or near the HTL|ETL interface. We find that the decreasing luminance efficiency is linearly correlated with an accumulation of immobile positive charge at the HTL|ETL interface, and the magnitude of the charge is comparable to the total charge at that interface when an unaged device is operated. A natural explanation of the connection between the two phenomena is that electrical aging either generates hole traps (and trapped holes) or drives met..."

Here we show that the ideality factor of the current of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) in the diffusion-dominated regime has a temperature-independent value of 2, which reveals that nonradiative trap-assisted recombination dominates the current. In contrast, the ideality factor of the light output approaches unity, demonstrating that luminance is governed by recombination of the bimolecular Langevin type. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by measuring the current and luminance ideality factor for a white-emitting polymer, where both free and trapped charge carriers recombine radiatively. With increasing bias voltage, Langevin recombination becomes dominant over trap-assisted recombination due to its stronger dependence on carrier density, leading to an enhancement in OLED efficiency. © 2011 American Physical Society."

This technique is applicable to a wide variety of OLED structures and is used to examine OLEDs which have a double‐ (D‐EML), mixed‐ (M‐EML), or graded‐emissive layer (G‐EML) architecture. The location of exciton recombination in an OLED is an important design parameter, as the local optical field sensed by the exciton greatly determines the efficiency and angular distribution of far‐field light extraction. The spatial extent of exciton recombination is an important parameter that can strongly impact exciton quenching and OLED efficiency, particularly under high excitation. A direct measurement of the exciton density profile is achieved through the inclusion of a thin, exciton sensitizing strip in the OLED emissive layer which locally quenches guest excitons and whose position in the emissive layer can be translated across the device to probe exciton formation. In the case of the G‐EML device architecture, an electronic model is developed to predict the location and extent of the exciton density profile by considering the drift, diffusion, and recombination of charge carriers within the device."

It is also critical that both the performance and cost be competitive against other lighting technologies in the selected marketplace. This presentation gives an overview of OLED lighting technology from these perspectives. It shows that OLED lighting products should be positioned as luminaires and not light bulbs, which affects both the performance and price expectations. Laboratory OLED devices already demonstrated efficacies that are more than competitive against luminaires based on other lighting technologies. There is potential for substantial further improvement in efficacy. The greatest opportunities come from light-extraction efficiency improvements and from an improved blue emitting system. There has been great recent progress in the OLED device lifetime. To be acceptable as luminaires, however, OLED may need even more lifetime improvements. Not all the improvements need to come from OLED technology improvement, however.

433,10.1364/OL.22.000396,1997,High-external-quantum-efficiency organic light-emitting devices.,"We study the internal and external quantum efficiencies of vacuum-deposited organic light-emitting devices (OLED's). The internal quantum efficiency of OLED's based on tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum is calculated to be 5.7 times the observed external quantum efficiency ?(e), consistent with measurements. We demonstrate a shaped substrate that increases ?(e) by a factor of 1.9+/-0.2 over similar OLED's fabricated upon flat glass substrates and leads to a 100%-emissive aperture, i.e., the emitting area completely occupies the display area even in the presence of metal interconnects. We also discuss a substrate structure that increases ?(e) by an additional factor of 2. The high device efficiencies are promising for developing OLED-based displays with extremely low power consumption and increased operational lifetime."

CsN3 is easily co‐deposited with the electron transporting materials in an organic molecular beam deposition chamber so that it works well as an n‐dopant in the electron transport layer because its evaporation temperature is similar to that of common organic materials. The driving voltage of the p‐i‐n device with the CsN3‐doped n‐type layer and a MoO3‐doped p‐type layer is greatly reduced, and this device exhibits a very high power efficiency (57 lm W−1). Additionally, an n‐doping mechanism study reveals that CsN3 was decomposed into Cs and N2 during the evaporation. The charge injection mechanism was investigated using transient electroluminescence and capacitance–voltage measurements. A very highly efficient tandem organic light‐emitting diodes (OLED; 84 cd A−1) is also created using an n–p junction that is composed of the CsN3‐doped n‐type organic layer/MoO3 p‐type inorganic layer as the interconnecting unit. This work demonstrates that an air‐stable and low‐temperature‐evaporable inorganic n‐dopant can very effectively enhance the device performance in p‐i‐n and tandem OLEDs, as well as simplify the material handling for the vacuum deposition process."

The ITO–metal–ITO (IMI) samples exhibited significantly reduced sheet resistance over ITO and greater than 80% optical transmission. The IMI films deposited on plastic substrates showed dramatically improved mechanical properties when subjected to bending both as a function of radius of curvature as well as number of cycles to a fixed radius. OLEDs were fabricated on both ITO and IMI anodes, and the devices with IMI anodes showed improved performance at current densities greater than 1mA∕cm2 due to the improved conductivity of the anode."

[1] The key challenge for their technological exploitation is the development of device structures that i) exhibit improved environmental stability under operation, especially for ﬂexible substrates, and ii) are able to emit with high efﬁciency at high luminance. [2–4] In terms of device stability, the use of highly reactive, low-work-function metals such as barium or calcium as electro-n-injecting-layer (EIL) materials is a major concern for conventional OLED device architectures, since they easily degrade in the presence of oxygen and moisture. [5,6] As such, developing more-stable electrode systems and indeed new device architectures is critically important for the realization of both stable and efﬁcient OLEDs. One recent approach is to use inorganic metal oxide ﬁlms as charge-injection layers. Metal oxides are particularly attractive in this role due to their mechanical and electrical robustness, low-cost, visible-light transparency, excellent environmental stability, good charge-transport properties, and the controllability of their ﬁlm morphology on nano-to micrometer length scales. Metal oxide ﬁlms have been recently employed as hole (HIL) and electron (EIL) injection layers in hybrid organic–inorganic light-emitting diodes (HyLEDs). [7,8] The use of transparent metal oxide ﬁlms as EILs is particularly attractive as it enables the use of opaque high-work-function metals, such as gold, for hole injection (with or without a separate HIL), yielding more-stable device architectures. Both titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) [7,8] and zinc oxide (ZnO) [9] ﬁlms have been recently investigated in polymer LEDs for use as EIL, and molybdenum"

[1] Nevertheless, it will be a challenge for OLEDs to compete against liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) for standard applications. While the angle-of-view dependency and the low contrast of liquid-crystal and plasma displays are no longer forceful arguments for OLED displays, high power efﬁciencies still render OLEDs a desirable display technique. Moreover, OLEDs could enable novel display applications; considerable relevance is attributed to the achievable high transparency of organic devices. The constituting layers of an OLED can be tailored to absorb only in the ultraviolet. The emission zone may exhibit a large Stokes shift. Thus, entirely see-through displays that can be integrated, for instance in automobile windshields to assist the driver"
438,10.1039/b715143h,2008,"High-sensitivity, disposable lab-on-a-chip with thin-film organic electronics for fluorescence detection.","We report a high-sensitivity, disposable lab-on-a-chip with a thin-film organic light-emitting diode (OLED) excitation source and an organic photodiode (OPD) detector for on-chip fluorescence analysis. A NPB/Alq3 thin-film green OLED with an active area of 0.1 cm(2) was used as the excitation source, while a CuPC/C(60) thin-film OPD with 0.6 cm(2) active area was used as a photodetector. A novel cost-effective, cross-polarization scheme was used to filter out excitation light from a fluorescent dye emission spectrum. The excitation light from the OLED was linearly polarized and used to illuminate a microfluidic device containing a 1 microL volume of dye dissolved in ethanol. The detector was shielded by a second polarizer, oriented orthogonally to the excitation light, thus reducing the photocurrent due to excitation light leakage on the detector by approximately 25 dB. The fluorescence emission light, which is randomly polarized, is only attenuated by approximately 3 dB. Fluorescence signals from Rhodamine 6G (peak emission wavelength of 570 nm) and fluorescein (peak emission wavelength of 494 nm) dyes were measured in a dilution series in the microfluidic device with emission signals detected by the OPD. A limit-of-detection of 100 nM was demonstrated for Rhodamine 6G, and 10 microM for fluorescein. This suggests that an integrated microfluidic device, with an organic photodiode and LED excitation source and integrated polarizers, can be fabricated to realize a compact and economical lab-on-a-chip for point-of-care fluorescence assays."
439,10.1167/13.7.6,2013,Evaluation of an organic light-emitting diode display for precise visual stimulation.,"A new type of visual display for presentation of a visual stimulus with high quality was assessed. The characteristics of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display (Sony PVM-2541, 24.5 in.; Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were measured in detail from the viewpoint of its applicability to visual psychophysics. We found the new display to be superior to other display types in terms of spatial uniformity, color gamut, and contrast ratio. Changes in the intensity of luminance were sharper on the OLED display than those on a liquid crystal display. Therefore, such OLED displays could replace conventional cathode ray tube displays in vision research for high quality stimulus presentation. Benefits of using OLED displays in vision research were especially apparent in the fields of low-level vision, where precise control and description of the stimulus are needed, e.g., in mesopic or scotopic vision, color vision, and motion perception."

We describe a novel, tunable OLED consisting of vertically stacked, transparent light-emitting devices which can serve as a color-tunable element in high-resolution full-color display., In addition, the unique physical properties of organic thin films allow for flexible, conformable, or foldable displays which are unobtainable with conventional, inorganic semiconductor technologies."

Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements clarified that the deposited thin films of these ETMs have optical anisotropy, indicating that the molecules in the deposited thin films tend to be mostly oriented parallel to the substrate. Green OLEDs containing these ETMs allowed a lower driving voltage than that for OLEDs containing tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) with a random orientation. In particular, the OLED containing Bpy-TP2 showed a significantly lower driving voltage, achieving lower power consumption when compared with conventional ETMs such as Alq3 and 1,3,5-tris(2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)benzene (TPBi). Also, the operational lifetime of a blue OLED containing Bpy-TP2 is equivalent to that of an OLED with TPBi. The increased driving voltage of the device containing Bpy-TP2 is significantly suppressed compared to that of the OLED containing TPBi."

However, when a tandem OLED utilizes optimized EL units, improved power efficiency can only be achieved if each intermediate connector has excellent carrier injection capabilities along with a negligible voltage drop across it. Four organic intermediate connectors were studied in this work, one of which consisting of a Li-doped 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline layer and a 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile layer, exhibits the best power efficiency improvement for tandem OLEDs."

Gather * IO N Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) offer unique characteristics such as fl exibility, light weight, area emission, and potentially transparent design and are therefore a promising candidate for future lighting and display applications. In terms of power consumption, color quality, and environmental aspects (such as the absence of mercury and low overall material use), OLEDs can already compete with or even outperform established light sources. [ 1,2 ] Top-emitting OLEDs are a special OLED confi guration where the light is emitted away from the carrier substrate, allowing the use of opaque substrates as well as integration with pre-patterned backplane driver electronics. In these devices, the bottom electrode materials can be freely chosen, which means that the ITO electrode, commonly used in bottom-emitting OLEDs, can be replaced by a material that is less expensive and/or easier to process. Top-emitting OLEDs have so far been mainly considered for display applications, for which they are particularly attractive due to a larger color gamut and higher effi ciency compared to bottom-emitting OLEDs.

Although the underlying chemical mechanisms are too complex to be completely elucidated, structures of several identified degradation products point at dissociations of relatively weak carbon-nitrogen and carbon-carbon bonds in arylamine molecules as the initiating step. Considering the photochemical reactivities, the bond dissociation reactions of arylamines occur by the homolysis of the lowest singlet excited states formed by recombining charge carriers in the operating OLED device. The subsequent chemical reactions are likely to yield long-lived, stabilized free radicals capable of acting as deep traps—nonradiative recombination centers and fluorescence quenchers. Their presence in the hole transport layer results in irreversible hole trapping and manifests as a positive fixed charge. The extent and localization of chemical transformations in se..."

Nanolaminate (NL) structures composed of alternating Al2O3 and ZrO2 sublayers grown by atomic layer deposition at 80 °C are used to realize long-term stable OLED devices. While the brightness of phosphorescent p-i-n OLEDs sealed by a single Al2O3 layer drops to 85% of the initial luminance of 1000 cd/m2 after 1000 h of continuous operation, OLEDs encapsulated with the NL retain more than 95% of their brightness. An extrapolated device lifetime substantially in excess of 10 000 h can be achieved, clearly proving the suitability of the NLs as highly dense and reliable thin film encapsulation of sensitive organic electronic devices."

The physical and chemical properties of polymerized cycloaliphatic epoxy hybrid materials (hybrimers) are easily tunable by controlling the precursors. A single hybrimer coating on a PET film is optically transparent and shows low permeability of up to 0.68 g m−2 day−1 per mil measured by a Ca degradation test.

Due to the temperature‐activated transport in organic semiconductors, this can result in brightness inhomogeneities and catastrophic failure. Here, it is shown that due to the strong electrothermal feedback of OLEDs, the common spatial current and voltage distribution is completely changed, requiring advanced device modeling and operation concepts. This study clearly demonstrates the effect of S‐shaped negative differential resistance in OLEDs induced by self‐heating. As a consequence, for increasing voltage, regions with declining voltages are propagating through the device, and even more interestingly, a part of these regions show even decreasing currents, leading to strong local variation in luminance. The expected breakthrough of OLED lighting technology will require an improved price performance ratio, and the realization of modules with very high brightness but untainted appearance is considered to be an essential step into this direction. Thus, a deeper understanding of the control of electrothermal feedback will help to make OLEDs in lighting more competitive."

The first organic light-emitting materials were fluorescent emitters in which only singlet excitons contributed to the overall device efficiency. [1] Highly efficient light-emitting materials based on phosphorescent emitters, which also use the radiative decay of triplet excitons, were developed, and these OLEDs performed well above, for example, incandescent lighting sources. [2] Since the beginning of OLED development, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been the most commonly used anode material. The ITO work function is typically in the range 4.5–4.7 eV and depends on the method of ITO preparation and its surface treatment. [3] This range of values is somewhat low for efficient hole injection in typical organic hole-transport materials. The low ITO work function becomes less important if electrically doped charge-transport layers are used. [4–7] If an intrinsic light-emitting layer is placed between n-and p-doped layers for electron and hole transport, this approach leads to a significant decrease in the driving voltage for so-called p–i–n-OLEDs, increasing the power efficiency of the device. Together with a double emission layer material, [8] these p–i–n structures are responsible for the highest OLED efficiencies reported to date. [7,9] For applications using flexible substrates, inorganic anodes such as ITO fail to provide stable anode properties, mainly because of their brittleness.

The enhancement in power efficiency at higher luminance is also over 50%. The remarkable enhancement in power efficiency has been attributed to the effective charge generation, transport and extraction due to the presence of interface-modified ZnPc:C60 CGL in tandem OLEDs.

The Streptomyces antibioticus glycosyltransferases, OleI and OleD, glycosylate and inactivate oleandomycin and diverse macrolides including erythromycin, respectively. The structure of these enzyme–ligand complexes, in tandem with kinetic analysis of site-directed variants, provide insight into the interaction of macrolides with their synthetic apparatus. Erythromycin binds to OleD and the 23S RNA of its target ribosome in the same conformation and, although the antibiotic contains a large number of polar groups, its interaction with these macromolecules is primarily through hydrophobic contacts. Erythromycin and oleandomycin, when bound to OleD and OleI, respectively, adopt different conformations, reflecting a subtle effect on sugar positioning by virtue of a single change in the macrolide backbone. The data reported here provide structural insight into the mechanism of resistance to both endogenous and exogenous antibiotics, and will provide a platform for the future redesign of these catalysts for antibiotic remodelling."

The OLED employs a device architecture capable of simultaneously generating all the emissions required to form a series of daylight chromaticities.

464,10.1021/JP7117373,2008,Aggregation-Induced Emissions of Fluorenonearylamine Derivatives : A New Kind of Materials for Nondoped Red Organic Light-Emitting Diodes,"A new kind of fluorenonearylamine derivatives possessing vagarious red-emitting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics was reported for the first time. On the basis of theoretical calculations and experimental results, the AIE was found to originate from the unique dimer (excimer) specifically in the aggregates. In the crystals of both compounds, every two molecules are bond together by intermolecular O···H or C···C bonds to form particular dimers. In virtue of their nice solid-state red fluorescence, nondoped red-light OLEDs based on these AIE-active materials were fabricated. The devices exhibited low turn-on voltages of about 3 V, luminescence of 14135 and 4813 cd m-2, and efficiencies of 1.40 and 0.35 lm W-1 based on the two materials. The results demonstrated that such AIE-active materials are promising candidates for nondoped red emission OLED applications."
465,10.1063/1.3636398,2011,Continuous blade coating for multi-layer large-area organic light-emitting diode and solar cell,"A continuous roll-to-roll compatible blade-coating method for multi-layers of general organic semiconductors is developed. Dissolution of the underlying film during coating is prevented by simultaneously applying heating from the bottom and gentle hot wind from the top. The solvent is immediately expelled and reflow inhibited. This method succeeds for polymers and small molecules. Uniformity is within 10% for 5 cm by 5 cm area with a mean value of tens of nanometers for both organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and solar cell structure with little material waste. For phosphorescent OLED 25 cd/A is achieved for green, 15 cd/A for orange, and 8 cd/A for blue. For fluorescent OLED 4.3 cd/A is achieved for blue, 9 cd/A for orange, and 6.9 cd/A for white. For OLED with 2 cm by 3 cm active area, the luminance variation is within 10%. Power conversion efficiency of 4.1% is achieved for polymer solar cell, similar to spin coating using the same materials. Very-low-cost and high-throughput fabrication of efficient ..."
466,10.1063/1.1425448,2002,Optimization of external coupling and light emission in organic light-emitting devices: modeling and experiment,"The emission of light and external coupling after the appropriate excitons have been formed in the organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) has been investigated. The internally emitted light can be classified into three modes: externally emitted, substrate waveguided, and indium–tin–oxide (ITO)/organic waveguided. A combined classical and quantum mechanical microcavity model is used to calculate the distribution of light emission into these three modes in an OLED on planar substrates. The ITO/organic modes maybe suppressed due to the thinness of the ITO/organic layers. Consequently, as much as over 50% of the internally generated light is emitted externally in some structures, much greater than the ∼20% figure given by classical ray optics. This model is used to examine how this distribution varies with exciton to cathode distance, the thickness of the ITO layer, and the index of refraction of the substrate. It can also be applied to OLEDs on shaped substrates where an increase in the total external emissi..."

The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was employed for the design and analysis of the PC OLED. Based on the design parameters derived from the FDTD calculations, a 2D PC layer was introduced on the glass substrate of a typical OLED structure by two-step irradiated hologram lithography and reactive ion etching. Experiments showed that incorporation of the PC layer improved the light extraction efficiency by over 50% compared to the conventional OLED, without noticeable degradation in electrical characteristics, under typical operating conditions. This improvement originates from the liberation of the photons trapped in the high-index guiding layers."
468,10.1063/1.2818362,2007,Characterization of triplet-triplet annihilation in organic light-emitting diodes based on anthracene derivatives,"We report that the steady-state electroluminescence in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on anthracene derivatives has a substantial contribution from annihilation of triplet states generated by recombining charge carriers. For the OLED devices of the following general structure: indium tin oxide∕N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine∕9,10-bis(2-naphthyl)-2-t-butylanthracene∕Alq3 (tris(8-hydroxyquinolate)aluminum)∕LiF∕Al, triplet-triplet annihilation contributes as much as 3%–6% of the overall electroluminescence. The intensity of triplet-triplet annihilation-related emission strongly varies with the current density and pulse width, being quadratic and linear functions of current density at low ( 10mA∕cm2) current density regimes, respectively. We find that quenching by charge carriers is the dominant decay process for the triplet states under a wide range of operating conditions, yielding triplet-state lifetimes from tens to hundreds of microseconds.

The proposed pixel circuit can effectively compensate for the threshold-voltage shift of the driving TFT and the OLED degradation, which is verified by the simulation work using SMART-SPICE software. It is shown that the average nonuniformity of the OLED current for the proposed pixel circuit is 5.7% compared with 85.7% for the conventional 2T1C pixel circuit, and thus, the brightness uniformity of AMOLED displays can be enhanced. Moreover, a high contrast ratio can be achieved by the proposed pixel circuit since the OLED does not emit any light except for the emission period."

Heat dissipation behavior of top-emission OLEDs fabricated on silicon, glass, and planarized stainless steel substrates was measured by using an infrared camera. Peak temperature measured from the backside of each substrate was saturated to be 21.4, 64.5, and 40.5 °C, 180 s after the OLED was operated at luminance of 10 000 cd/m2 and 80% luminance lifetime was about 198, 31, and 96 h, respectively. Efficient heat dissipation through the highly thermally conductive substrates reduced temperature increase, resulting in much improved OLED lifetime."

The PO moiety is used as a point of saturation between the fluorene bridge and the outer phenyl groups so that the triplet exciton energy of PO6 is 2.72 eV, similar to that of a dibromo substituted fluorene, but it is more amenable to vacuum sublimation and has good film forming properties. Computational analysis (B3LYP/6-31G*) predicts the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of PO6 to be lower by 1.5 and 0.59 eV, respectively, compared to a similar diphenylamino substituted derivative. In a simple bilayer OLED device, PO6 exhibits structured UV electroluminescence at a peak wavelength of 335 nm and structured lower energy emission with peaks at 380 and 397 nm, similar to the sol..."
472,10.1021/AR030210R,2005,Toward the ideal organic light-emitting diode. The versatility and utility of interfacial tailoring by cross-linked siloxane interlayers.,"Small molecule and polymer organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promise of revolutionizing display technologies. Hence, these devices and the materials that render them functional are the focus of intense scientific and technological interest. The archetypical multilayer OLED heterostructure introduces numerous chemical and physical challenges to the development of efficient and robust devices. It is demonstrated here that robust, pinhole-free, conformal, adherent films with covalently interlinked structures are readily formed via self-assembling or spin-coating organosilane-functionalized molecular precursors at the anode-hole transport layer interface. In this manner, molecularly ""engineered"" hole transport and hydrocarbon anode functionalization layers can be introduced with thicknesses tunable from the angstrom to nanometer scale. These investigations unequivocally show that charge injection and continuity at the anode-hole transport layer interface, hence OLED durability and efficiency, can be substantially enhanced by these tailored layers."
473,10.1021/JA0263588,2002,"1,8-Naphthalimides in phosphorescent organic LEDs: the interplay between dopant, exciplex, and host emission.","Four different 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives were examined in phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), i.e., 1,8-naphthalimide, N-phenyl-1,8-naphthalimide, N-2,6-dibromophenyl-1,8-naphthalimide (niBr), and bis-N,N-1,8-naphthalimide. Photoluminescence from all four naphthalimides have violet-blue fluorescence and phosphorescent bands between 550 and 650 nm (visible at 77 K). While all four compounds gave good glassy films when doped with a phosphorescent dopant, only the niBr films remained glassy for extended periods. OLED studies focused on niBr, with two different architectures. One OLED structure (type 1) had the niBr layer as a doped luminescent layer and an undoped niBr layer to act as a hole-blocking layer. The alternate structure (type 2) utilizes a doped CBP layer as the luminescent layer and the niBr layer is used as a hole-blocking layer only (CBP = 4,4'-N,N'-dicarbazolylbiphenyl). Type 1 and 2 OLEDs were prepared with green, yellow, and red emissive phosphorescent dopants (Irppy, btIr, and btpIr, respectively). The dopants were organometallic Ir complexes, previously shown to give highly efficient OLEDs. Of the three dopants, the btpIr-based OLEDs showed the best device performance in both structures (peak efficiencies for type 2: 3.2% and 2.3 lum/W at 6.3 V; type 1: 1.7% and 1.3 lm/W at 6.1 V). The green and yellow dopants gave very similar performance in both type 1 and 2 devices (peak efficiencies are 0.2-0.3%), which were significantly poorer than the btpIr-based OLEDs. The emission spectrum of the btIr- and btpIr-based devices (type 1 and 2) are the same as the solution photoluminescence spectrum of the dopant alone, while the Irppy device gives a broad red emission line (lambda(max) = 640 nm). The red Irppy.niBr emission line is assigned to an Irppy.niBr exciplex. The type 2 Irppy-based device gave a voltage-dependent spectrum, with the red emission observed at low bias (4-8 V), switching over to strong green emission as the bias was raised. All other devices showed bias-independent spectra. Estimates of HOMO, LUMO, and excited-state energies (dopant, niBr, and exciplex) were used to explain the observed spectral properties of these devices. btpIr-based devices emit efficiently from isolated dopant states (external efficiencies = 3.2 %, 2.3 lum/W). Irppy-based devices emit only from exciplex states, with low efficiency (external efficiency = 0.3%). btIr.niBr films have very similar energies for the dopant, exciplex, and niBr triplet states, such that relaxation can go through any of these states, leading to low device efficiency (external efficiency = 0.4%). High device efficiency is achieved only when dopant emission is the dominant pathway for relaxation, since exciplex and niBr triplet states give either weak or no electroluminescence."
474,10.1364/OE.17.007562,2009,Exceptionally efficient organic light emitting devices using high refractive index substrates.,"Organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) are now used in commercial cell phones and flat screen displays, but may become even more successful in lighting applications, in which large area, high efficiency, long lifetime and low cost are essential. Due to the relatively high refractive index of the organic layers, conventional planar bottom emitting OLEDs have a low outcoupling efficiency. Various approaches for enhancing the optical outcoupling efficiency of bottom emitting OLEDs have been introduced in the literature. In this paper we demonstrate a green bottom emitting OLED with a record external quantum efficiency (42%) and luminous efficacy (183 lm/W). This OLED is based on a high index substrate and a thick electron transport layer (ETL) which uses electrical doping. The efficient light outcoupling is modeled by optical simulations."
475,10.1002/ADFM.200700154,2008,Influence of Molecular Dipoles on the Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence of Dipolar Spirobifluorenes,"This Full Paper investigates a series of strongly fluorescent donor–acceptor‐substituted spirobifluorene compounds, red 2‐diphenylamino‐7‐(2,2‐dicyanovinyl)‐9,9′‐spirobifluorene (DCV), green 2‐diphenylamino‐9,9′‐spirobifluorene7‐carxoxaldehyde (CHO), and blue 2‐diphenylamino‐7‐(2,2‐diphenylvinyl)‐9,9′‐spirobifluorene (DPV), together with their spiro‐linked “dimeric” analogs, 2DCV, 2,2′‐bis(diphenylamino)‐9,9′‐spirobifluorene‐7,7′‐dicarboxaldehyde (2CHO), and 2,2′‐bis(diphenylamino)‐7,7′‐bis(2,2‐diphenylvinyl)‐9,9′‐spirobifluorene (2DPV), respectively. The emission optical density and, hence, the intensity of photoluminescence (PL) or electroluminescence (EL) of the “dimeric” analogs is presumed to increase, which is beneficial for organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) applications. The physical properties, including the dipole moments obtained from quantum chemistry calculations, emission solvatochromism, fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) as well as the EL of these six spirobifluorene compounds have been examined in detail. We found that Φf as well as OLED performance (EL efficiency and intensity) of the strongly dipolar DCV decrease significantly in the “dimeric” analog 2DCV, but less so in the moderately dipolar CHO and 2CHO, and only slightly in the weakly dipolar DPV and 2DPV. This is parallel to the intramolecular dipole moment, which is large for 2DCV, medium for 2CHO, and very small for 2DPV. Here, we show for the first time systematically that the luminescence intensity is closely correlated with the local electric field induced by the molecular dipole. A strong electric field may facilitate radiationless decay channels with a charge‐transfer nature, leading to a high quenching rate. Consistent with this conclusion, which is derived from the red DCV/2DCV and green CHO/2CHO, our new blue fluorophore DPV with an essentially zero dipole moment has successfully achieved one of the best electrofluorescent blue OLEDs. At the same time, by doping the highly dipolar DCV into an isolated environment with the low‐polarity Alq3 as the host matrix, we obtained a very high performance of saturated yellow OLEDs as well, This is possibly due to the reduction of emission‐quenching dipoles from the neighboring molecules. Our results have provided an important insight in designing luminescent materials, as follows: molecular dipole moments should be kept at a low magnitude to avoid quenching induced by a strong local electric field in the chromophore."
476,10.1021/jp807429h,2009,Theoretical study of the cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes used as chromophores for organic light-emitting diodes.,"Time-dependent density functional theory with linear and quadratic response technology is used to calculate electronic structure, spectra, and spin-orbit coupling effects for analysis of the main mechanism for phosphorescence of the recently synthesized iridium complex [bis(2-phenylpyridine)(2-carboxy-4-dimethylaminopyridine)iridium(III)]. This compound exhibits strong green phosphorescence which is used in solution processable organic light-emitting diode devices (OLEDs) to overcome the efficiency limit imposed by the formation of triplet excitons. Attempting to foresee new structure-property relations that can guide an improved design of OLED devices based on phosphorescence of the lowest triplet state, we have conducted a theoretical analysis of the photophysical properties of a series of iridium cyclometalated complexes."

We report on efficient OLEDs with an inverted top-emitting architecture on recyclable cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) substrates. The OLEDs have a bottom cathode of Al/LiF deposited on a 400 nm thick N,N′-Di-[(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl]-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (α-NPD) layer and a top anode of Au/MoO3. They achieve a maximum luminance of 74 591 cd/m2 with a current efficacy of 53.7 cd/A at a luminance of 100 cd/m2 and 41.7 cd/A at 1000 cd/m2. It is shown that the α-NPD layer on the CNC substrate is necessary for achieving high performance OLEDs. The electroluminescent spectra of the OLEDs as a function of viewing angle are presented and show that the OLED spectra are subject to microcavity effects."

The full‐color pixel structure can be attained by using a combination of top‐emission OLEDs and fine‐patterned OTFTs. The fine‐patterned OTFTs are integrated by utilizing an organic semiconductor (OSC) separator, which is an insulating wall structure made of an organic insulator. Organic insulators are actively used for the OTFT integration, as well as for the separator, in order to enhance the mechanical flexibility of the OTFT backplane. By using these technologies, active‐matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays can be driven by the developed OTFT backplane even when they are mechanically flexed."

The excited states are formed at a blue fluorescent light-emitting layer (LEL), and the triplets diffuse through a spacer layer to one or more phosphorescent LEL(s). A key feature enabling the triplet diffusion in such OLEDs is the use of a blue fluorescent emitter with triplet energy above, or not much below, that of the fluorescent host.

A very low turn-on voltage (3 V) was actually observed for the device with NiO on ITO. The enhancement of hole injections by depositing NiO on the ITO anode was further verified by the hole-only devices. The excellent hole-injection ability of NiO was also demonstrated by devising a device with patterned NiO on the ITO anode. Our results suggest that the NiO/ITO anode is an excellent choice to enhance hole injections of OLED devices.

Apparent model-dependent values of the electron mobility (μe) in Alq3 have been calculated from the onset of EL for both device structures upon invoking different internal electric field distributions. For the single-layer OLEDs, transient experiments with different dc bias voltages indicated that the EL delay time is determined by the accumulation of charge carriers inside the device rather than by transport of the latter. This interpretation is supported by the observation of delayed EL after the voltage pulse is turned off. In the multilayer OLED the ..."

The results show that it is possible to obtain OMR at voltages below ``turn-on,'' where no OMR was visible for devices operated in the dark. The photoinduced OMR has a field dependence that is identical to that obtained for OLEDs containing very thin layers, where triplet dissociation at the cathode was a major component of the OMR. At voltages around the open circuit voltage, where the current through the device is very small, very large OMRs of $\ensuremath{\sim}300%$ can be observed. The results support our proposed model for organic magnetoresistance as being caused in part by the interaction of free carriers with triplet excitons within the device.

By controlling the thickness of the dielectric layer deposited on top of a thin metal cathode, the transmittance of the top electrode can be adjusted. Maximum light output is not achieved at highest cathode transmittance, indicating that the interplay between different interference effects can be controlled by means of the capping-layer thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the electrical device characteristic is not influenced by the capping layer. The strength of our concept in particular lies in the fact that the optical and the electrical device performance can be optimized separately. Using the capping-layer concept, we have achieved an OLED efficiency of 64 cd/A with pure green emission."
494,10.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.00880.x,1998,Two glycosyltransferases and a glycosidase are involved in oleandomycin modification during its biosynthesis by Streptomyces antibioticus,"A 5.2 kb region from the oleandomycin gene cluster in Streptomyces antibioticus located between the oleandomycin polyketide synthase gene and sugar biosynthetic genes was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of three open reading frames (designated oleI, oleN2 and oleR). The oleI gene product resembled glycosyltransferases involved in macrolide inactivation including the oleD product, a previously described glycosyltransferase from S. antibioticus. The oleN2 gene product showed similarities with different aminotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of 6‐deoxyhexoses. The oleR gene product was similar to several glucosidases from different origins. The oleI, oleR and oleD genes were expressed in Streptomyces lividans. OleI and OleD intracellular proteins were partially purified by affinity chromatography in an UDP‐glucuronic acid agarose column and OleR was detected as a major band from the culture supernatant. OleI and OleD showed oleandomycin glycosylating activity but they differ in the pattern of substrate specificity: OleI being much more specific for oleandomycin. OleR showed glycosidase activity converting glycosylated oleandomycin into active oleandomycin. A model is proposed integrating these and previously reported results for intracellular inactivation, secretion and extracellular reactivation of oleandomycin."
495,10.1063/1.4717463,2012,Red-green-blue polymer light-emitting diode pixels printed by optimized laser-induced forward transfer,"An optimized laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) technique has been used to fabricate tri-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED) pixels. At reduced pressures, and with a defined donor-receiver gap, patterned depositions of polyfluorene-based OLED pixels have been achieved. OLED pixel functionality has been demonstrated and compared with devices made using conventional deposition techniques. In addition, improved functionality has been obtained by coating the cathode with an electron-injecting layer, a process not possible using conventional OLED fabrication techniques. The OLED pixels fabricated by LIFT reach efficiencies on the range of conventionally fabricated devices and even surpass them in the case of blue pixels."
496,10.1063/1.3097354,2009,Microcavity top-emitting organic light-emitting devices integrated with diffusers for simultaneous enhancement of efficiencies and viewing characteristics,"We show that integrating diffuser films with microcavity top-emitting organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) provide a convenient approach for simultaneously achieving large quantum- efficiency enhancement (1.38 times compared to top-emitting devices without diffusers and 2.1 times compared to conventional bottom-emitting devices) and improving viewing characteristics (more saturated/stable colors over angles, emission patterns more Lambertian, pixel sharpness remained) of top-emitting microcavity OLEDs for display applications. Most importantly, the fabrication of the diffuser films is simple and effective. These features may make it attractive for use in enhancing OLED performances in various applications."
497,10.1021/JZ101039D,2010,Dumbbell-Shaped Spirocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon to Control Intermolecular π−π Stacking Interaction for High-Performance Nondoped Deep-Blue Organic Light-Emitting Devices,"Dumbbell-shaped spirocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the basis of molecular modeling exhibit no π−π stacking interaction among chromophores in the molecular packing diagrams. A model compound of 1,6-di(spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-2-yl)pyrene (DSFXPy) with the pyrene−pyrene distance of up to 10.4 A has been synthesized for high-performance nondoped deep-blue organic light-emitting devices. The proof-of-concept nondoped OLEDs have been fabricated with the configuration of ITO/MoOx(2 nm)/NPB(30 nm)/DSFXPy(30 nm)/TPBi(40 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al. DSFXPy-based nondoped OLED exhibits a maximum current efficiency of 7.4 cd/A (4.6% at 260 cd m−2) and excellent CIE coordinates (0.16, 0.15) (at 6500 cd m−2), surpassing most reported nondoped deep-blue OLEDs. Dumbbell-shaped spirocyclic arenes will be promising candidates for OLEDs."
498,10.1063/1.3200947,2009,Organic light-emitting diode with liquid emitting layer,"We demonstrate an original organic light-emitting diode (OLED) having a neat liquid host of 9-(2-ethylhexyl)carbazole (EHCz) doped with a guest emitter of 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnapthacene (rubrene). The device structure is composed of indium tin-oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulphonate)/EHCz:rubrene/Cs2CO3/ITO. We demonstrate that the liquid organic semiconducting layer surely transports charge carriers, leading to electroluminescence from rubrene with the highest external quantum efficiency of ηext=0.03% at a current density of 0.26 mA/cm2. Our demonstration of the liquid-OLEDs will open another possibility of organic semiconductors and light-emitting applications."
499,10.1117/12.416878,2001,Gas permeation and lifetime tests on polymer-based barrier coatings,"We describe a flexible, transparent plastic substrate for OLED display applications. A flexible, composite thin film barrier is deposited under vacuum onto commercially available polymers, restricting moisture and oxygen permeation rates to undetectable levels using conventional permeation test equipment. The barrier is deposited under vacuum in a process compatible with conventional roll- coating technology. The film is capped with a thin film of transparent conductive oxide yielding an engineered substrate (BarixTM) for next generation, rugged, lightweight or flexible OLED displays. Preliminary tests indicate that the substrate is sufficiently impermeable to moisture and oxygen for application to moisture-sensitive display applications, such as organic light emitting displays, and is stable in pure oxygen to 200 degrees Celsius."
