0,10.1021/acsaem.8b00012,"Hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains are more flexible than alkyl chains and can facilitate the π–π stacking of conjugated polymer backbones, which has been proven to be a key structural feature leading to better device performance in polymer:fullerene blend polymer solar cells (PSCs). So far, little has been known about the influence of OEG side chains on the performance of non-fullerene acceptors in polymer:non-fullerene acceptor blends. Based on an easily accessible conjugated backbone of dicyanomethylene indanone–thiophene–fluorene–thiophene–dicyanometnylene indanone (DICTF), two non-fullerene molecular acceptors were synthesized with decyl (DICTF-C10) and triethylene glycol monoether (DICTF-TEG) side chains to blend with the polymer donor of PTB7-Th for PSCs. Replacing the decyl side chains with the TEGs on DICTF does improve the π–π stacking between the conjugated backbones as expected. For DICTF-TEG, nevertheless, forming the BHJ blend with the PTB7-Th donor leads to unfavorable fil..."
1,10.1021/acsaem.8b00574,"A novel conjugated D–A polymer, PTBFBz, with asymmetrical thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF) and fluorobenzotriazole (Bz) units was designed and synthesized for the first time. PTBFBz showed the strong absorption with a wide bandgap of 1.89 eV. Power conversion efficiency of nonfullerene polymer solar cells based on PTBFBz:ITIC with thermal and sequential solvent annealing reached up to 8.33%, which is the highest reported value among the asymmetrical TBF-based polymer solar cells. The results demonstrate that the asymmetrical TBF unit can be one of the most promising building blocks in constructing the wide bandgap polymers for highly efficient polymer solar cells."
2,10.1021/acsaem.8b00453,"Reducing voltage loss, namely, Vloss, has been demonstrated to be an effective way to improve the efficiencies of photovoltaic devices, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% have been reported in non-fullerene based polymer solar cells (PSCs) with Vloss value lower than 0.6 V. However, for all polymer solar cells (APSCs), the PCEs lag far behind the non-fullerene PSCs with organic small molecular acceptors. And there have been no successful examples of high-efficiency APSCs along with low Vloss values so far. Here, we reported APSCs that demonstrated a high efficiency of 6.66% simultaneously with a small voltage loss of 0.56 V by using a new polymer PBDT-DFQX1 as donor and N2200 as acceptor. Notably, when PBDT-DFQX1 is combined with a small molecular acceptor (SMA) O-IDTBR, the relative SMA based PSC exhibited a higher PCE of 8.76% also with a low voltage loss of 0.56 V. These results indicated that PBDT-DFQX1 would be a promising polymer donor material in photovoltaic device application,..."
3,10.1021/acsaem.8b00506,"A benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-based donor material with chlorine atoms substituted on its side chains, named PBClT, was designed and developed in order to enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc) without decreasing charge carrier transfer in the corresponding blend films. The chlorinated polymer, PBClT, was an excellent donor material possessing a blue-shifted absorbance, resulting in desired complementary light absorption with low-band gap acceptor materials, for example, ITIC. In addition, the multiple chlorination dramatically decreased the HOMO energy level of PBClT, and the Voc of the corresponding device increased to 1.01 V, which is much higher than that of the nonchlorine analogous, PTB7-Th, with a Voc of approximately 0.82 V. The GIWAXS experiments displayed that PBClT/ITIC blend films showed a “face-on” orientation, which suggested that the chlorine substituents on the side chains favored π–π stacking in the direction perpendicular to the electron flow in photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, the ..."
4,10.1021/acsaem.8b00183,"The performance of boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as electron-accepting materials in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with a range of reported literature polymers were simultaneously screened to observe if the design criteria for polymeric electron-donating materials, originally designed for pairing with fullerene derivatives, can be applied to non-fullerene electron acceptors. Initially, the morphology and film formation of the BsubPc-containing active layer films was improved by using a volatile additive, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, which is known to solubilize a BsubPc but not a representative high-performing polymer (PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8). Thereafter, with the resulting semioptimal fabrication parameters, 10 polymeric electron-donating materials were screened with the BsubPc derivative, PhO-Cl6BsubPc (phenoxy-hexachloro-boron-subphthalocyanine), and PC61BM. Device metrics demonstrate that the BsubPc-based devices perform in-line with their ana..."
5,10.1021/acsaem.8b00535,"A conjugated polymer donor containing BODIPY-thiophene dyads in the backbone, P(BdP-EHT), combined with a low bandgap nonfullerene acceptor (SMDPP) consisting of carbazole and diketopyrrolopyrrole units linked with a tetracyanobutadiene acceptor π-linker, was used to design bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. After the optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapor annealing of the P(BdP-EHT):SMDPP active layer, the resulting polymer solar cell showed an overall power conversion efficiency of 9.29%, which is significantly higher than that for the polymer solar cell based on PC71BM (7.41%) processed under identical conditions. This improved power conversion efficiency is attributed to enhanced values of short circuit photocurrent and open circuit voltage, the better light harvesting efficiency of the P(BdP-EHT):SMDPP active layer in the near-infrared region, and the higher Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy level of the SMDPP as compared to PC71BM, combined. Moreov..."
6,10.1021/acsaem.8b00929,"Three molecular semiconductors are compared and evaluated in organic field-effect transistors and organic solar cells. The molecules are constructed from the dyes diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), perylene diimide (PDI), and N-(alkyl)benzothioxanthene-3,4-dicarboximide (BTXI). The compound PDI–DPP–PDI (1) has previously been reported and used as a nonfullerene acceptor. The compounds PDI–DPP–BTXI (2) and BTXI–DPP–BTXI (3) were synthesized using direct (hetero)arylation methods and fully identified using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. All three compounds were characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations. Increasing the BTXI content results in a progressive destabilization of the electronic energy levels. For all compounds, no significant changes in the optical absorption spectra are observed when compared to a combination of the constituent optical absorption spectra. Compound 1 exhibits electron transport characteristics and functions as an..."
7,10.1021/acsami.6b03926,"Carrier mobility is a vital factor determining the electrical performance of organic solar cells. In this paper we report that a high-efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cell (NF-OSC) with a power conversion efficiency of 6.94 ± 0.27% was obtained by optimizing the hole and electron transportations via following judicious selection of polymer donor and engineering of film-morphology and cathode interlayers: (1) a combination of solvent annealing and solvent vapor annealing optimizes the film morphology and hence both hole and electron mobilities, leading to a trade-off of fill factor and short-circuit current density (Jsc); (2) the judicious selection of polymer donor affords a higher hole and electron mobility, giving a higher Jsc; and (3) engineering the cathode interlayer affords a higher electron mobility, which leads to a significant increase in electrical current generation and ultimately the power conversion efficiency (PCE)."
8,10.1021/acsami.6b08284,"Solvent additive has proven as a useful protocol for improving the film nanomorphology of polymer donor (D): fullerene acceptor (A) blends in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic cells. By contrast, the effect of such solvent additive on nonfullerene BHJ cells based on perylene diimide acceptor, for instance, is less effective because of their highly planar structure and strong π-aggregation in solid state. Here we choose N,N'-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene (PTB7) as a model D:A blend system to investigate how solvent engineering strategy synergistically impacts the blend film nanomorphology. Based on the differences of solvent volatility and solubility, various host solvents-chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) and solvent additives-chloronaphthalene (CN) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) are selected for comparative studies. It is found that the π-aggregation of PDIs can be largely suppressed by using low-boiling point (Tb) CF solvent, yet enlarged by using high-Tb CB. Moreover, CN additive provides good solubility of PDI molecules and hence reduces large PDI aggregates in CB system, while DIO exhibiting poor solubility works oppositely. By contrast, DIO that presents larger Tb difference with CF prolongs the film-forming, which assists in optimizing the PDI aggregation and increases the intermixed PTB7:PDI phases more significantly than CN in CF system, yielding the finest phase-separation morphology and balanced charge mobility. Consequently, the inverted BHJ cells based on CF-processed PTB7:PDI blend film with 0.4 vol % DIO exhibit the highest PCE of 3.55% with a fill factor of 56%, both of which are among the best performance for such a paradigm PTB7:PDI blend-based BHJ cells."
9,10.1021/acsami.6b15707,"New small molecules having modified acceptor strength and π-conjugation length and containing dicyanovinylene (DCV) and tricyanovinylene (TCV) as a strongly electron-accepting unit with indacenodithiophene, IDT(DCV)2, IDT(TCV)2, and IDTT(TCV)2, were synthesized and studied in terms of their applicability to polymer solar cells with PTB7-Th as an electron-donating polymer. Intriguingly, the blended films containing IDT(TCV)2 and IDTT(TCV)2 exhibited superior shelf life stabilities of more than 1000 h without any reduction in the initial power conversion efficiency. The low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels and robust internal morphologies of small TCV-containing molecules could afford excellent shelf life stability."
10,10.1021/acsami.6b16395,"We designed, synthesized, and characterized a series of novel electron deficient small molecule nonfullerene acceptors based on 1,8-naphthalimide (NAI) and 9-fluorenone (FN) with different branched alkyl chains using various techniques. These molecules are based on an acceptor-donor-acceptor-donor-acceptor (A1-D-A2-D-A1) molecular design configuration with NAI as the end-capping acceptor (A1), FN as electron-withdrawing central (A2) group, and thiophene ring as a donor (D) unit. These materials are named as NAI-FN-NAI (BO) and NAI-FN-NAI (HD) where BO and HD represent butyloctyl and hexyldecyl alkyl groups, respectively. To further modify energy levels of these materials, we converted the weak electron withdrawing ketonic group (C═O) attached to the FN moiety of NAI-FN-NAI (BO) to a stronger electron withdrawing cyano group (C≡N) to obtain the compound NAI-FCN-NAI (BO) by keeping the same alkyl chain. The optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties of the new acceptors were studied. The materials exhibited higher to medium band gaps, low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, and highly thermally stable properties. Organic solar cell devices employing conventional poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) a donor polymer and the newly designed small molecules as the acceptor were investigated. Among all new materials, organic solar cell devices based on NAI-FN-NAI (BO) as an acceptor exhibit the highest performance with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 9.1 mAcm-2, a fill factor (FF) of 45%, and an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.6%. This is the first report of 9-fluorenone based nonfullerene acceptor with P3HT donor in organic solar cell devices with such a promising performance."
11,10.1021/acsami.7b05417,"There has been a growing interest in the design and synthesis of non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells that may overcome the drawbacks of the traditional fullerene-based acceptors. Herein, two novel push-pull (acceptor-donor-acceptor) type small-molecule acceptors, that is, ITDI and CDTDI, with indenothiophene and cyclopentadithiophene as the core units and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) as the end-capping units, are designed and synthesized for non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). After device optimization, PSCs based on ITDI exhibit good device performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 8.00%, outperforming the CDTDI-based counterparts fabricated under identical condition (2.75% PCE). We further discuss the performance of these non-fullerene PSCs by correlating the energy level and carrier mobility with the core of non-fullerene acceptors. These results demonstrate that indenothiophene is a promising electron-donating core for high-performance non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors."
12,10.1021/acsami.7b06650,"A formylated benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) (BDCPDT) ladder-type structure with forced coplanarity is coupled with two 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) moieties via olefination to form a non-fullerene acceptor, BDCPDT-IC. The BDCPDT-IC, as an acceptor (A1) with broad light-absorbing ability and excellent solution processability, is combined with a second PC71BM acceptor (A2) and a medium band gap polymer, PBDB-T, as the donor (D) to form a ternary blend with gradient HOMO/LUMO energy alignments and panchromatic absorption. The device with the inverted architecture using the D:A1:A2 ternary blend has achieved a highest efficiency of 9.79% with a superior Jsc of 16.84 mA cm-2."
13,10.1021/acsami.7b09253,"Recent years have seen a rapid progress in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF PSCs). However, the donor materials accordingly used are typical low or medium band gap polymers, some of which possess badly overlapped absorption spectra relative to the low band gap n-type acceptors, for example, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene) (ITIC). To obtain polymers simultaneously owning a wide band gap, a highly extended π-conjugation system, and a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), a polymer (PBDTSi-TA) incorporating 2-(triisopropylsilylethynyl)thiophene substituted benzodithiophene (BDTSi) and fluorinated benzotriazole (FTAZ) units was designed and synthesized. PBDTSi-TA (Egopt = 1.92 eV) exhibits strong molecular aggregation properties and a lower-lying HOMO energy level compared to its structural analogues. When blended with ITIC and after device optimization with solvent vapor annealing in combination with a developed PDIN/BCP/Ag cathode structure, PSCs yielded a PCE of 7.51%, with Voc = 0.96 V. Moreover, a rather small energy loss (Eloss) of 0.6-0.63 eV was determined. For comparison, another polymer (PBDTSi-Qx) with a more-electron-deficient quinoxaline-based acceptor unit was also synthesized and applied to NF PSCs. Charge generation rate, exciton dissociation probabilities, dark leakage current, nanoscale morphology, and charge carrier mobilities have been evaluated to probe the reasons for the differentiated performances. The results suggest that PBDTSi-TA is a promising donor material for NF PSCs, and the molecular design strategy demonstrated here would be helpful for pursuing high-performance polymers for PSCs."
14,10.1021/acsami.7b09757,"Although the combination of wide band gap polymer donors and narrow band gap small-molecule acceptors achieved state-of-the-art performance as bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers for organic solar cells, there have been only several of the wide band gap polymers that actually realized high-efficiency devices over >10%. Herein, we developed high-efficiency, low-energy-loss fullerene-free organic solar cells using a weakly crystalline wide band gap polymer donor, PBDTTPD-HT, and a nonfullerene small-molecule acceptor, ITIC. The excessive intermolecular stacking of ITIC is efficiently suppressed by the miscibility with PBDTTPD-HT, which led to a well-balanced nanomorphology in the PBDTTPD-HT/ITIC BHJ active films. The favorable optical, electronic, and energetic properties of PBDTTPD-HT with respect to ITIC achieved panchromatic photon-to-current conversion with a remarkably low energy loss (0.59 eV)."
15,10.1021/acsami.7b09915,"Three indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IT) cored small molecular acceptors (ITIC-SC6, ITIC-SC8, and ITIC-SC2C6) were synthesized, and the influence of side chains on their performances in solar cells was systematically probed. Our investigations have demonstrated the variation of side chains greatly affects the charge dissociation, charge mobility, and morphology of the donor:acceptor blend films. ITIC-SC2C6 with four branched side chains showed improved solubility, which can ensure the polymer donor to form favorable fibrous nanostructure during the drying of the blend film. Consequently, devices based on PBDB-ST:ITIC-SC2C6 demonstrated higher charge mobility, more effective exciton dissociation, and the optimal power conversion efficiency up to 9.16% with an FF of 0.63, a Jsc of 15.81 mA cm-2, and a Voc of 0.92 V. These results reveal that the side chain engineering is a valid way of tuning the morphology of blend films and further improving PCE in polymer solar cells."
16,10.1021/acsami.7b10059,"A new wide-band-gap conjugated polymer PBODT was successfully synthesized that showed high crystallinity and was utilized as the active material in nonfullerene bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs). The photovoltaic devices based on the as-cast blend films of PBODT with ITIC and IDIC acceptors showed notable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.06% and 9.09%, with high open-circuit voltages of 1.00 and 0.93 V that correspond to low energy losses of 0.59 and 0.69 eV, respectively. In the case of PBODT:ITIC, lower exciton quenching efficiency and monomolecular recombination are found for devices with small driving force. On the other hand, the relatively higher driving force and suppressed monomolecular recombination for PBODT:IDIC devices are identified to be the reason for their higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and higher PCEs. In addition, when processed with the nonchlorinated solvent 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, a good PCE of 8.19% was still achieved for the IDIC-based device. Our work shows that such wide-band-gap polymers have great potential for the environmentally friendly fabrication of highly efficient PSCs."
17,10.1021/acsami.7b12612,"In this research, a haptacyclic carbazole-based dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) ladder-type structure was formylated to couple with two 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) moieties, forming a new nonfullerene acceptor DTCCIC-C17 using a bulky branched 1-octylnonayl side chain at the nitrogen of the embedded carbazole and four 4-octylphenyl groups at the sp3-carbon bridges. The rigid and coplanar main-chain backbone of the DTCC core provides a broad light-absorbing window and a higher-lying LUMO energy level, whereas the bulky flanked side chains reduce intermolecular interactions, making DTCCIC-C17 amorphous with excellent solution processability. The DTCCIC-C17 as an acceptor is combined with a medium band gap polymer poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1',3'-di-2-thienyl-5',7'-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1',2'-c:4',5'-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) as the donor in the active layer to obtain suitable highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy alignments and complimentary absorption. The devices with an inverted configuration (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag) without using an aqueous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate layer were fabricated for better device stability. When the diiodooctane-treated PBDB-T:DTCCIC-C17 active layer was thermally annealed at 50 °C for 10 min, the device achieved the highest efficiency of 9.48% with a high Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 14.27 mA cm-2, and an FF of 0.68."
18,10.1021/acsami.7b16406,"The geometries of acceptors based on perylene diimides (PDIs) are important for improving the phase separation and charge transport in organic solar cells. To fine-tune the geometry, biphenyl, spiro-bifluorene, and benzene were used as the core moiety to construct quasi-three-dimensional nonfullerene acceptors based on PDI building blocks. The molecular geometries, energy levels, optical properties, photovoltaic properties, and exciton kinetics were systematically studied. The structure-performance relationship was discussed as well. Owing to the finest phase separation, the highest charge mobility and smallest nongeminate recombination, the power conversion efficiency of nonfullerene solar cells using PDI derivatives with biphenyl core (BP-PDI4) as acceptor reached 7.3% when high-performance wide band gap donor material poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1',3'-di-2-thienyl-5',7'-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1',2'-c:4',5'-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione))] was blended."
19,10.1021/acsami.7b18152,"We synthesized three semicrystalline polymers (PTTBTBO, PDTBTBO, and P2FDTBTBO) by modulating the intra- and intermolecular noncovalent Coulombic interactions and investigated their photovoltaic characteristics under various light intensities. Low series (Rs) and high shunt (Rsh) resistances are essential prerequisites for good device properties under standard illumination (100 mW cm-2). Considering these factors, among three polymers, PDTBTBO polymer solar cells (PSCs) exhibited the most desirable characteristics, with peak power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 7.52 and 9.60% by being blended with PC71BM under standard and dim light (2.5 mW cm-2), respectively. P2FDTBTBO PSCs exhibited a low PCE of 3.69% under standard light due to significant charge recombination with high Rs (9.42 Ω cm2). However, the PCE was remarkably improved by 2.3 times (8.33% PCE) under dim light, showing negligible decrease in open-circuit voltage and remarkable increase in fill factor, which is due to an exceptionally high Rsh of over 1000 kΩ cm2. Rs is less significant under dim light because the generated current is too small to cause noticeable Rs-induced voltage losses. Instead, high Rsh becomes more important to avoid leakage currents. This work provides important tips to further optimize PSCs for indoor applications with low-power electronic devices such as Internet of things sensors."
20,10.1021/acsami.7b18717,"Two types of electron acceptors were synthesized by coupling two kinds of electron-rich cores with four equivalent perylene diimides (PDIs) at the α-position. With fully aromatic cores, TPB and TPSe have π-orbitals spread continuously over the whole aromatic conjugated backbone, unlike TPC and TPSi, which contain isolated PDI units due to the use of a tetrahedron carbon or silicon linker. Density functional theory calculations of the projected density of states showed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for TPB are localized in separate regions of space. Further, the LUMO of TPB shows a greater contribution from the orbitals belonging to the connective core of the molecules than that of TPC. Overall, the properties of the HOMO and LUMO point at increased intra-molecular delocalization of negative charge carriers for TPB and TPSe than for TPC and TPSi and hence at a more facile intra-molecular charge transfer for the former. The film absorption and emission spectra showed evidences for the inter-molecular electron delocalization in TPB and TPSe, which is consistent with the network structure revealed by X-ray diffraction studies on single crystals of TPB. These features benefit the formation of charge transfer states and/or facilitate charge transport. Thus, higher electron mobility and higher charge dissociation probabilities under Jsc condition were observed in blend films of TPB:PTB7-Th and TPSe:PTB7-Th than those in TPC:PTB7-Th and TPSi:PTB7-Th blend films. As a result, the Jsc and fill factor values of 15.02 mA/cm2, 0.58 and 14.36 mA/cm2, 0.55 for TPB- and TPSe-based solar cell are observed, whereas those for TPC and TPSi are 11.55 mA/cm2, 0.47 and 10.35 mA/cm2, 0.42, respectively."
21,10.1021/acsami.8b00216,"We used the quinoxaline (Qx) unit to design and synthesize two nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors of Qx1 and Qx1b with an A2-A1-D-A1-A2 skeleton, where indacenodithiophene (IDT), Qx, and rhodanine (R) were adopted as the central donor (D), bridge acceptors (A1), and terminal acceptors (A2), respectively. Qx1 and Qx1b contain different side chains of 4-hexylphenyl and octyl in the central IDT segment to modulate the properties of final small molecules. Both small molecules show good thermal stability, high solubility, and strong and broad absorption spectra with optical band gaps of 1.74 and 1.68 eV, respectively. Qx1 and Qx1b exhibit the complementary absorption spectra with the classic poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of -3.60 and -3.66 eV, respectively. Polymer solar cells based on P3HT:Qx1 showed a high open-circuit voltage ( Voc) of 1.00 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.03%, whereas P3HT:Qx1b achieved a Voc of 0.95 V and a PCE of 4.81%. These results demonstrate that the Qx unit is also an effective building block to construct promising n-type nonfullerene small molecules to realize a relatively high Voc and PCE for P3HT-based solar cells."
22,10.1021/acsami.8b01308,"The open-circuit voltage ( Voc) loss has always been a major factor in lowering power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). A method to improve the Voc is indispensable to achieve high PCEs. In this paper, we investigated a series of perylene diimide-based ladder-type molecules as electron acceptors in nonfullerene OPVs. The D-A ladder-type structures described here lock our π-systems into a planar structure and eliminate bond twisting associated with linear conjugated systems. This enlarges the interface energy gap (Δ EDA), extends electronic delocalization, and hence improves the Voc. More importantly, these devices showed an increase in Voc without compromising either the Jsc or the FF. C5r exhibited a strong intermolecular interaction and a PCE value of 6.1%. Moreover, grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis and atomic force microscopy images suggested that our fused-ring acceptors showed a suitable domain size and uniform blend films, which were not affected by their rigid molecular structures."
23,10.1021/acsami.8b04541,"In this work, a kind of ""donor-acceptor (D-A) combined π-bridge"" based on the regioselective reactivity of monofluoro-substituted benzothiadiazole (FBT) to link a thiophene ring has been designed to construct a new A-π-D-π-A-type small molecular acceptor (IDT-FBTR) with indacenodithiophene (IDT) as a central core (D) and 3-octyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine as an electron-withdrawing terminal group (A). Because of the strong intramolecular push-pull electron effect, the IDT-FBTR shows a strong and broad intramolecular charge-transfer absorption band in the range of 500-750 nm. Especially, as an electron-deficient FBT unit (A') and an electron-rich thiophene ring (D') in ""D-A combined π-bridge"" exert an ""offset effect"" to regulate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the molecule, a relatively high LUMO energy level can be maintained for IDT-FBTR that is helpful to enhance the open-circuit voltage ( Voc) for highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, the optimized OSC device based on IDT-FBTR as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor shows a much high Voc of 1.02 V with a relatively low Eloss of 0.56 eV and a best power conversion efficiency of 9.14%."

The as-generated copolymers show the comparable optical and electrochemical properties. The alkylthio-thienyl-substituted BDT unit facilities a benign decrease of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. This consequently enhances open-circuit voltages ( VOC) over 0.9 V in relevant solar cells with the fullerene acceptor ([6, 6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, PC71BM) or the nonfullerene acceptor (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3- d:2',3'- d']- s-indaceno[1,2- b:5,6- b']dithiophene, ITIC). The combination studies of Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy and electroluminescence further rationalize the VOC difference between solar cells with fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors. An impressively high power conversion efficiency of 10.19% is obtained for the device based on PTzBI-Ph:ITIC, outperforming the 8.84% achieved by the PC71BM-based device. Our results demonstrate that the modification of substituents of BDT units can effectively decrease the HOMO level and consequently improve VOC, ultimately allowing the attainment of high-efficiency polymer solar cells."
25,10.1021/acsami.8b04432,"We present here a series of wide-band-gap ( Eg: >1.8 eV) polymer donors by incorporating thiophene-flanked phenylene as an electron-donating unit and quinoxaline as an electron-accepting co-unit to attain large open-circuit voltages ( Vocs) and short-circuit currents ( Jscs) in nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Fluorination was utilized to fine-tailor the energetics of polymer frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) by replacing a variable number of H atoms on the phenylene moiety with F. It was found that fluorination can effectively modulate the polymer backbone planarity through intramolecular noncovalent S···F and/or H···F interactions. Polymers (P2-P4) show an improved molecular packing with a favorable face-on orientation compared to their nonfluorinated analogue (P1), which is critical to charge carrier transport and collection. When mixed with IDIC, a nonfullerene acceptor, P3 with two F atoms, achieves a remarkable Voc of 1.00 V and a large Jsc of 15.99 mA/cm2, simultaneously, yielding a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7%. Notably, the 1.00 V Voc is among the largest values in the IDIC-based OSCs, leading to a small energy loss ( Eloss: 0.62 eV) while maintaining a large PCE. The P3:IDIC blend shows an efficient exciton dissociation through hole transfer even under a small energy offset of 0.16 eV. Further fluorination leads to the polymer P4 with increased chain-twisting and mismatched FMO levels with IDIC, showing the lowest PCE of 2.93%. The results demonstrate that quinoxaline-based copolymers are promising donors for efficient OSCs and the fluorination needs to be fine-adjusted to optimize the interchain packing and physicochemical properties of polymers. Additionally, the structure-property correlations from this work provide useful insights for developing wide-band-gap polymers with low-lying highest occupied molecular orbitals to minimize Eloss and maximize Voc in nonfullerene OSCs for efficient power conversion."

The IDT2BR materials mix fully with PC71BM materials, and the energy state of this phase can be tuned by varying the blending ratio. We performed photoluminescence and external quantum efficiency studies and found that the ternary charge cascade structure efficiently transfers the photogenerated charges from the polymer to IDT2BR and finally to PC71BM materials. Ternary blend devices containing the IDT2BR:PC71BM acceptor blend and various types of donor polymers were found to exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) improved by more than 10% over the PCEs of the binary blend devices."

A trade-off between suppressing the self-aggregation and maintaining the charge-transfer properties was achieved by FTPDI2. Using PTB7-Th as the electron donor, the FTPDI2-based nonfullerene OSCs show a high power conversion efficiency of 8.28%, without the assistance of any additives."

Recently, ternary polymer solar cell blends have been explored as a strategy to improve PSC performance; however, this approach has been demonstrated only for polymer–fullerene solar cells with organic ternary additives and has not addressed stability issues under supersolar irradiation. Here, we present the first polymer solar cells comprising ternary blends of high efficiency polymers, nonfullerene perylenediimide acceptors, and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube additives.

When mesitylene was used as the solvent, rather than chlorobenzene, an improved power conversion efficiency (11.1%) was achieved without the need for pre- or post-treatments.

Meanwhile, chlorine substitution lowered the HOMO level of PBTCl, which increased the open-circuit voltage of the corresponding polymer-based devices. The 2D GIWAXS analysis illustrated that the PBTCl/ITIC blend film exhibited a “face-on” orientation and scattering features of both PBTCl and ITIC, suggesting that the blend of PBTCl and ITIC was phase-separated and formed individual crystalline domains of the donor and acceptor, which promoted charge transfer in the bicontinuous film and eventually elevated the solar energy conversion efficiency. The PBTCl-based nonfullerene PSC exhibited a maximum PCE of 7.57% with a Voc of 0.91 V, which was an approximately 13% increasing in the PCE compared to that of the ..."

In this work, a series of nonfullerene PSCs were fabricated with J71 as the donor and IT-M and/or ITIC with an almost identical band gap as acceptors. Although IT-M and ITIC have almost identical band gaps, the two optimized binary PSCs exhibit different photovoltaic parameters. The short current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of J71:IT-M based PSCs are larger than those of J71:ITIC based PSCs; the other key parameter, the fill factor (FF), is just the opposite. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of optimized ternary PSCs arrives at 11.60% by inheriting the advantages of binary PSCs.

Optimization of the photoactive layer nanomorphology yields a short-circuit current density value of 27.3 mA/cm2, one of the highest values in organic solar cells reported to date, which competes with other types of solution-processed solar cells such as perovskite or quantum dot devices. Along with decent open-circuit voltage (0.71 V) and fill factor values (66%), a power conversion efficiency of 12.8% is achieved for the champion devices. Morphology characterizations elucidate that the origin of this high photocurrent is mainly the increased π–π coherence length of the acceptor, the domain spacing, as well as the mean-square composition variation of the blend. Optoelectronic measurements confirm a balanced hole and electron mobility and reduced trap-assisted recombination for the best devices."

The trade-off between ΔEDA and photocurrent generation significantly limits the simultaneous enhancement of both VOC and short-circuit current density (JSC). Here, we report a new medium-bandgap NFA, IDTT-T, containing a weakly electron-withdrawing N-ethyl thiabarbituric acid terminal group on each end of the indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) core.

The standard PBDB-T:BDCPDT-IC device showed a PCE of 9.33% with a Voc of 0.86 V and a Jsc of 16.56 mA/cm2. By molecular engineering of the acceptor unit, the BDCPDT-TTC:PBDB-T-based device delivered an enhanced efficiency of 10.29% with a simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.94 V and Jsc of 17.72 mA/cm2. Incorporation of the electron-donating thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit into the acceptor moiety decreases the electron-accepting strength, thereby upshifting the HOMO/LUMO energy levels to decrease the ΔEHOMO and Eloss, achieving a larger Voc.

We find that the strong intermolecular interaction and favorable antiparallel packing induced by the dipole moment can effectively enhance both lamellar packing and π–π stacking.

This molecular design results in excellent solubility in solutions, ordered molecular packing in films, slightly elevated energy levels, and a higher film absorption coefficient.

We report herein on an investigation of the effect of the substituents on the thiophene (T) linker between NTz and Np on the properties and photovoltaic performance. The photophysical and physicochemical measurements showed that the absorption behavior as well as frontier-orbital energy levels can be fine-tuned by the choice of the substituent on the thiophene rings. Bulk-heterojunction-type OSCs based on these acceptors under blending with poly(3-hexylthiophene) as a donor showed various power conversion efficiencies, ranging from 0.26 to 2.14%. The substituents on the thiophene rings also have a significant influence on the blend film properties, which explain the differences in the short-circuit current densities and fill factors in the OSCs.

This article demonstrates that the photovoltaic characteristics of blend films of regioregular poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (rr‐P3HT) and PDI molecules are improved upon using a core‐alkylated PDI derivative instead of the often used N‐alkylated PDI molecules. A doubling of the power conversion efficiency of P3HT:PDI solar cells by using the core‐alkylated PDI derivative is observed leading to an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 0.5% for a P3HT:PDI solar cell under AM1.5 solar illumination. Furthermore, the optical properties of the novel PDI derivative are compared to two standard exclusively N‐alkylated PDI derivatives by steady‐state and time‐resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in solution and solid state. The experiments reveal that aggregation in the solid state determines the photophysics of all PDI derivatives. However, the emission energy and excited state lifetime of the aggregates are clearly influenced by the alkyl‐substitution pattern through its effect on the packing of the PDI molecules. X‐ray diffraction experiments before and after thermal annealing of PDI:polystyrene and PDI:P3HT blends reveal subtle differences in the packing characteristics of the different PDI derivatives and, problematically, that P3HT ordering is suppressed by all of the PDI derivatives."

However, their too strong self-assembly power that promoted the formation of mesoor microscale structures over exciton diffusion length scales [ 13 ] also limited their use for BHJ solar cell applications. Therefore, realizing balanced aggregation with effi cient charge transport in CN-substituted stilbenic structures remained challenging. This work focused on developing novel dicyanodistyrylbenzene-based non-fullerene acceptors with high electron affi nities and good solution processability. A specifi c method for modulating the self-assembly tendencies was implemented by incorporating a naphthalimide (NI) moiety into the terminal position of the molecules. The bulkiness of the NI substituent weakened the intermolecular interactions, so that the balanced aggregation characteristics could be induced. Indeed, aggregate formation in the spin-coated fi lm was dramatically suppressed, in contrast with the structures observed among other cyanostilbene thin fi lms. Furthermore, the outstanding electron-transporting properties of the NI unit [ 9,14 ] synergistically affected the electron acceptor properties, and the material solubilities were also notably increased by introducing branched alkyl chains at the N-position of the NI moiety. The photovoltaic properties of these molecules were investigated using regioregular poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor.

To maximize the VOC of PSCs, it is important to fine‐tune the energy level offset between the donor and acceptor materials, but in a way not negatively affecting the morphology of the donor:acceptor (D:A) blends. Here, an effective material design rationale based on a family of D–A1–D–A2 terthiophene (T3) donor polymers is reported, which allows for the effective tuning of energy levels but without any negative impacts on the morphology of the blend. Based on a T3 donor unit combined with difluorobenzothiadiazole (ffBT) and difluorobenzoxadiazole (ffBX) acceptor units, three donor polymers are developed with highly similar morphological properties. This is particularly surprising considering that the corresponding quaterthiophene polymers based on ffBT and ffBX exhibit dramatic differences in their solubility and morphological properties. With the fine‐tuning of energy levels, the T3 polymers yield nonfullerene PSCs with a high efficiency of 9.0% for one case and with a remarkably low energy loss (0.53 V) for another polymer.

In this study, a series of methoxyl‐modified dithieno[2,3‐d:2′,3′‐d′]‐s‐indaceno[1,2‐b:5,6‐b′]dithiophene‐based small‐molecule acceptor (SMA) isomers are synthesized and characterized to determine the effect of substitution position of the terminal group in these acceptor–donor–acceptor‐type SMAs. Minor changes in the substitution position are demonstrated to greatly influence the optoelectronic properties and molecular packing of the isomers. Note that SMAs with planar molecular backbones show more ordered molecular packing and smaller π–π stacking distances, thus dramatically higher electron mobilities relative to their counterparts with distorted end‐groups. By utilizing polymer poly[(2,6‐(4,8‐bis(5‐(2‐ethylhexyl)thiophen‐2‐yl)benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b′]dithiophen)‐co‐(1,3‐di(5‐thiophene‐2‐yl)‐5,7‐bis(2‐ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2‐c:4,5‐c′]dithiophene‐4,8‐dione)] (PBDB‐T) as an electron donor, an optimum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9% is achieved in the device based on PBDB‐T:IT‐OM‐2, which is among the top efficiencies reported as of yet. Moreover, the PCE stays above 10% as the film thickness increases to 250 nm, which is very advantageous for large‐area printing. Overall, the intrinsic molecular properties as well as the morphologies of blends can be effectively modulated by manipulating the substituent position on the terminal groups, and the structure–property relationships gleaned from this study will aid in designing more efficient SMAs for versatile applications."

The PSCs based on J81:ITIC and J81:m‐ITIC yield high power conversion efficiency of 10.60% and 11.05%, respectively, with high V oc of 0.95–0.96 V benefit from the lower‐lying HOMO energy level of J81 donor.

The solar cells are based on poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with varying molecular weights and a nonfullerene acceptor (rhodanine‐benzothiadiazole‐coupled indacenodithiophene, IDTBR) and are fabricated in air. P3HT:IDTBR solar cells light‐soaked over the course of 2000 h lose about 5% of power conversion efficiency (PCE), in stark contrast to [6,6]‐Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)‐based solar cells whose PCE shows a burn‐in that extends over several hundreds of hours and levels off at a loss of ≈34%. Replacing PCBM with IDTBR prevents short‐circuit current losses due to fullerene dimerization and inhibits disorder‐induced open‐circuit voltage losses, indicating a very robust device operation that is insensitive to defect states. Small losses in fill factor over time are proposed to originate from polymer or interface defects. Finally, the combination of enhanced efficiency and stability in P3HT:IDTBR increases the lifetime energy yield by more than a factor of 10 when compared with the same type of devices using a fullerene‐based acceptor instead."
53,10.1002/aenm.201700834,"“Nonfullerene” acceptors are proving effective in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells when paired with selected polymer donors. However, the principles that guide the selection of adequate polymer donors for high‐efficiency BHJ solar cells with nonfullerene acceptors remain a matter of some debate and, while polymer main‐chain substitutions may have a direct influence on the donor–acceptor interplay, those effects should be examined and correlated with BHJ device performance patterns. This report examines a set of wide‐bandgap polymer donor analogues composed of benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b′]dithiophene (BDT), and thienyl ([2H]T) or 3,4‐difluorothiophene ([2F]T) motifs, and their BHJ device performance pattern with the nonfullerene acceptor “ITIC”. Studies show that the fluorine‐ and ring‐substituted derivative PBDT(T)[2F]T largely outperforms its other two polymer donor counterparts, reaching power conversion efficiencies as high as 9.8%. Combining several characterization techniques, the gradual device performance improvements observed on swapping PBDT[2H]T for PBDT[2F]T, and then for PBDT(T)[2F]T, are found to result from (i) notably improved charge generation and collection efficiencies (estimated as ≈60%, 80%, and 90%, respectively), and (ii) reduced geminate recombination (being suppressed from ≈30%, 25% to 10%) and bimolecular recombination (inferred from recombination rate constant comparisons). These examinations will have broader implications for further studies on the optimization of BHJ solar cell efficiencies with polymer donors and a wider range of nonfullerene acceptors."

With negligible influence on optical bandgaps and energy levels, the crystalline behavior of PTTI‐Tx polymers was modulated by varying the T:2T ratio in the polymer backbone; this resulted in the formation of different microstructures upon blending with a nonfullerene m‐ITIC acceptor in NF‐PSCs. In particular, a PTPTI‐T70:m‐ITIC system enabled favorable small‐scale phase separation with an increased population of face‐on oriented crystallites, thereby boosting the processes of effective exciton dissociation and charge transport in the device. Consequently, the highest power conversion efficiency of 11.02% with an enhanced short‐circuit current density of 17.12 mA cm−2 is achieved for the random polymer‐based NF‐PSCs thus far. These results indicate that random terpolymerization is a simple and practical approach for the optimization of a donor polymer toward highly efficient NF‐PSCs."
55,10.1002/aenm.201701674,"Nonfullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on polymer donors and nonfullerene small molecular acceptors (SMAs) have recently attracted considerable attention. Although much of the progress is driven by the development of novel SMAs, the donor polymer also plays an important role in achieving efficient nonfullerene PSCs. However, it is far from clear how the polymer donor choice influences the morphology and performance of the SMAs and the nonfullerene blends. In addition, it is challenging to carry out quantitative analysis of the morphology of polymer:SMA blends, due to the low material contrast and overlapping scattering features of the π–π stacking between the two organic components. Here, a series of nonfullerene blends is studied based on ITIC‐Th blended with five different donor polymers. Through quantitative morphology analysis, the (010) coherence length of the SMA is characterized and a positive correlation between the coherence length of the SMA and the device fill factor (FF) is established. The study reveals that the donor polymer can significantly change the molecular ordering of the SMA and thus improve the electron mobility and domain purity of the blend, which has an overall positive effect that leads to the enhanced device FF for nonfullerene PSCs."

The chemical, optical, and physical properties, device characteristics, and film morphology of 6TIC are intensively studied. 6TIC shows a narrow bandgap with band edge reaching 905 nm due to the electron‐rich π‐conjugated 6T core and reduced resonance stabilization energy. The rigid, π‐conjugated 6T also offers lower reorganization energy to facilitate very low VOC loss in the 6TIC system. The analysis of film morphology shows that PTB7‐Th and 6TIC can form crystalline domains and a bicontinuous network. These domains are enlarged when thermal annealing is applied. Consequently, the device based on PTB7‐Th:6TIC exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.07% with a high JSC > 20 mA cm−2 and a high VOC of 0.83 V with a relatively low VOC loss (≈0.55 V).

As a large portion of the solar energy is located in the near‐infrared region, it is important to develop ultralow‐bandgap SMAs that have extended absorption in the spectral range of 800–1000 nm to maximize light absorption and efficiencies. In this work, three low‐bandgap SMAs, namely, IXIC, IXIC‐2Cl, and IXIC‐4Cl, are designed and synthesized with same fused terthieno[3,2‐b]thiophene donor unit and different end groups (EGs). The three SMAs all have low optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.35, 1.30, and 1.25 eV, respectively. The chlorination on EGs can lower the energy level and broaden absorption range of the SMAs. As a result, the Voc of the devices is reduced but the Jsc is significantly increased. In addition, the addition of chlorine atoms can enhance π–π stacking and crystallinity of the SMAs, which result in high fill factors. Overall, the optimum EGs are monochlorine‐substituted IC and OSCs based on PBDB‐T:IXIC‐2Cl that can achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 12.2%, which is one of the highest PCEs for nonfullerene organic solar cells based on low‐bandgap SMAs."

On the contrary, the face‐on oriented π–π stacking is only slightly disrupted by the H‐di‐PDI, which has a more rigid structure to provide suitable percolation pathways for charge transport. As a result, a very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.41% is achieved in the PTB7‐Th:H‐di‐PDI derived device.

OPV devices based on NTz‐Np under the blend with P3HT show high photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 2.81%, which is the highest class among the P3HT/nonfullerene‐based OPVs with the conventional device structure.

Very interestingly, the exciton dissociation efficiency in the active layer is quite high, even though the LUMO and HOMO energy differences between the donor and acceptor materials are as small as ≈0.08 and 0.19 eV, respectively. The PCE of 6% is the highest for the PSCs with a Voc as high as 1.3 V.

The sulfur atom insertion further reduces the HOMO level of PBDTS–NQx to −5.31 eV, contributing to a high open‐circuit voltage, Voc, of 0.91 V. Conjugated n‐octylthienyl side chains attached on the NQx skeletons also significantly improve the π–π* transitions and optical absorptions of the copolymers in the region of short wavelengths, which induce a good complementary absorption when blending with the low bandgap small molecular acceptor of 3,9‐bis(2‐methylene‐(3‐(1,1‐dicyanomethylene)‐indanone))‐5,5,11,11‐tetrakis(4‐hexylphenyl)‐dithieno[2,3‐d:2′,3′‐d′]‐s‐indaceno[1,2‐b:5,6‐b′]dithiophene.

In this study, we employ transient optical and optoelectronic analysis to elucidate the factors determining device photocurrent and FF in blends of the highly crystalline donor polymer PffBT4T‐2OD with the promising NFA FBR or the more widely studied fullerene acceptor PC71BM. Geminate recombination losses, as measured by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, are observed to be significantly higher for PffBT4T‐2OD:FBR blends. This is assigned to the smaller LUMO‐LUMO offset of the PffBT4T‐2OD:FBR blends relative to PffBT4T‐2OD:PC71BM, resulting in the lower photocurrent generation efficiency obtained with FBR. Employing time delayed charge extraction measurements, these geminate recombination losses are observed to be field dependent, resulting in the lower FF observed with PffBT4T‐2OD:FBR devices.

71,10.1002/adfm.201704507,"To maximize the short‐circuit current density (JSC) and the open circuit voltage (VOC) simultaneously is a highly important but challenging issue in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a benzotriazole‐based p‐type polymer (J61) and three benzotriazole‐based nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (BTA1‐3) are chosen to investigate the energetic driving force for the efficient charge transfer. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of small molecule acceptors can be fine‐tuned by modifying the end‐capping units, leading to high VOC (1.15–1.30 V) of OSCs. Particularly, the LUMO energy level of BTA3 satisfies the criteria for efficient charge generation, which results in a high VOC of 1.15 V, nearly 65% external quantum efficiency, and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.25%. This is one of the highest VOC in the high‐performance OSCs reported to date. The results imply that it is promising to achieve both high JSC and VOC to realize high PCE with the carefully designed nonfullerene acceptors."

A novel nonfullerene acceptor (ITC6‐IC) is designed and developed by introducing long alkyl chains into the terminal electron‐donating building blocks. ITC6‐IC has achieved definite conformation with a planar structure and better solubility in common organic solvents. The weak electron‐donating hexyl upshifts the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of ITC6‐IC, resulting in a higher VOC in comparison to the widely used ITIC. The OSCs based on PBDB‐T:ITC6‐IC reveal a promising power conversion efficiency of 11.61% and an expected high VOC of 0.97 V. The weaker π–π stacking induced by steric hindrance affords ITC6‐IC with enhanced compatibility with polymer donors. The blend film treated with suitable thermal annealing exhibits a fibril crystallization feature with a good bicontinuous network morphology. The results indicate that the molecular design approach of ITC6‐IC can be inspirational for future development of nonfullerene acceptors for high efficiency OSCs."

Here, a comprehensive study is reported to understand the impacts of charge transport, energetic disorder, and charge transfer states (CTS) on the losses in open‐circuit voltage (Voc) based on three high performing bulk heterojunction solar cells with the best PCE exceeding 11%. It is found that the champion poly[(2,6‐(4,8‐bis(5‐(2‐ethylhexyl)thiophen‐2‐yl)benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b′]dithiophene)‐co‐(1,3‐di(5‐thiophene‐2‐yl)‐5,7‐bis(2‐ethylhexyl)‐benzo[1,2‐c:4,5‐c′]dithiophene‐4,8‐dione))] (PBDB‐T):IT‐M solar cell (PCE = 11.5%) is associated with the least disorder. The determined energetic disorder in part reconciles the difference in Voc between the solar cells. A reduction is observed in the nonradiative losses (ΔVnonrad) coupled with the increase of energy of CTS for the PBDB‐T:IT‐M device, which may be related to the improved balance in carrier mobilities, and partially can explain the gain in Voc. The determined radiative limit for Voc combined with the ΔVnonrad generates an excellent agreement for the Voc with the experimental values. The results suggest that minimizing the energetic disorder related to transport and CTS is critical for the mitigation of Voc losses and improvements on the device performance."

On the other side, a little more blueshifted but much stronger absorption and much lower‐lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level can be realized for PBDTF‐FBT when introducing fluorine atoms instead of sulfur atoms. With the combination of both fluorination and sulfuration strategies, PBDTS‐FBT exhibits the best absorption ability, lowest HOMO energy level, and highest crystallinity, which make PBDTSF‐FBT devices show the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.69% in fullerene PSCs and 11.66% in nonfullerene PSCs.

Moreover, the open‐circuit voltage (Voc) of the ternary PSCs is enhanced with an increase of the third acceptor ITCN content, which is attributed to the higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of ITCN than that of IT‐M, thus exhibits a higher Voc in PBDB‐T:ITCN binary system. Ultimately, the ternary PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 12.16%, which is higher than the PBDB‐T:ITM‐based PSCs (10.89%) and PBDB‐T:ITCN‐based ones (2.21%). This work provides an effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs."

These copolymers exhibit wide bandgaps over 2.07 eV and low‐lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels below −5.35 eV, which match well with the typical low‐bandgap acceptor of ITIC, resulting in a good complementary absorption from 300 to 900 nm and a low HOMO level offset (≤0.13 eV). Compared to PBDT‐TDZ, PBDTS‐TDZ with alkylthio side chains exhibits the stronger optical absorption, lower‐lying HOMO level, and higher crystallinity. By using a single green solvent of o‐xylene, PBDTS‐TDZ:ITIC devices exhibit a large open‐circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.10 eV and an extremely low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.48 eV. At the same time, the desirable high short‐circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.78 mA cm−2 and fill factor of 65.4% are also obtained, giving rise to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.80% without any additive and post‐treatment. When adopting a homotandem device architecture, the PCE is further improved to 13.35% (certified as 13.19%) with a much larger Voc of 2.13 V, which is the best value for any type of homotandem organic solar cells reported so far."

In addition to matched energy levels and complementary absorption spectrum with IDIC, PM6 possesses high crystallinity and strong π–π stacking alignment, which are favorable to charge carrier transport and hence suppress recombination in devices. As a result, the PM6:IDIC‐based PSCs without extra treatments show an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9%, which is the record value for the as‐cast PSC devices reported in the literature to date. Moreover, the device performances are insensitive to the active layer thickness (≈95–255 nm) and device area (0.20–0.81 cm2) with PCEs of over 11%. Besides, the PM6:IDIC‐based flexible PSCs with a large device area of 1.25 cm2 exhibit a high PCE of 6.54%. These results indicate that the PM6:IDIC blend is a promising candidate for future roll‐to‐roll mass manufacturing and practical application of highly efficient PSCs."

Relative to naphthalene‐based IHIC2, naphthodithiophene‐based IOIC2 with a larger π‐conjugation and a stronger electron‐donating core shows a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (IOIC2: −3.78 eV vs IHIC2: −3.86 eV), broader absorption with a smaller optical bandgap (IOIC2: 1.55 eV vs IHIC2: 1.66 eV), and a higher electron mobility (IOIC2: 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 vs IHIC2: 5.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Thus, IOIC2‐based OSCs show higher values in open‐circuit voltage, short‐circuit current density, fill factor, and thereby much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) values than those of the IHIC2‐based counterpart. In particular, as‐cast OSCs based on FTAZ: IOIC2 yield PCEs of up to 11.2%, higher than that of the control devices based on FTAZ: IHIC2 (7.45%). Furthermore, by using 0.2% 1,8‐diiodooctane as the processing additive, a PCE of 12.3% is achieved from the FTAZ:IOIC2‐based devices, higher than that of the FTAZ:IHIC2‐based devices (7.31%). These results indicate that incorporating extended conjugation into the electron‐donating fused‐ring units in nonfullerene acceptors is a promising strategy for designing high‐performance electron acceptors."
108,10.1002/adma.201704904,"Organic solar cell optimization requires careful balancing of current–voltage output of the materials system. Here, such optimization using ultrafast spectroscopy as a tool to optimize the material bandgap without altering ultrafast photophysics is reported. A new acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)‐type small‐molecule acceptor NCBDT is designed by modification of the D and A units of NFBDT. Compared to NFBDT, NCBDT exhibits upshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level mainly due to the additional octyl on the D unit and downshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level due to the fluorination of A units. NCBDT has a low optical bandgap of 1.45 eV which extends the absorption range toward near‐IR region, down to ≈860 nm. However, the 60 meV lowered LUMO level of NCBDT hardly changes the Voc level, and the elevation of the NCBDT HOMO does not have a substantial influence on the photophysics of the materials. Thus, for both NCBDT‐ and NFBDT‐based systems, an unusually slow (≈400 ps) but ultimately efficient charge generation mediated by interfacial charge‐pair states is observed, followed by effective charge extraction. As a result, the PBDB‐T:NCBDT devices demonstrate an impressive power conversion efficiency over 12%—among the best for solution‐processed organic solar cells."
109,10.1002/adma.201705208,"Most nonfullerene acceptors developed so far for high‐performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are designed in planar molecular geometry containing a fused‐ring core. In this work, a new nonfullerene acceptor of DF‐PCIC is synthesized with an unfused‐ring core containing two cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) moieties and one 2,5‐difluorobenzene (DFB) group. A nearly planar geometry is realized through the F···H noncovalent interaction between CPDT and DFB for DF‐PCIC. After proper optimizations, the OSCs with DF‐PCIC as the acceptor and the polymer PBDB‐T as the donor yield the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.14% with a high fill factor of 0.72. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is among the highest values for the OSCs with nonfullerene acceptors owning unfused‐ring cores. Furthermore, no obvious morphological changes are observed for the thermally treated PBDB‐T:DF‐PCIC blended films, and the relevant devices can keep ≈70% of the original PCEs upon thermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h. This tolerance of such a high temperature for so long time is rarely reported for fullerene‐free OSCs, which might be due to the unique unfused‐ring core of DF‐PCIC. Therefore, the work provides new idea for the design of new nonfullerene acceptors applicable in commercial OSCs in the future."

Compared to the reported ITIC with phenylalkyl side chains, the new acceptor C8‐ITIC exhibits a reduction in the optical band gap, higher absorptivity, and an increased propensity to crystallize. Accordingly, blends with the donor polymer PBDB‐T exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 12.4%. Further improvements in efficiency are found upon backbone fluorination of the donor polymer to afford the novel material PFBDB‐T. The resulting blend with C8‐ITIC shows an impressive PCE up to 13.2% as a result of the higher open‐circuit voltage. Electroluminescence studies demonstrate that backbone fluorination reduces the energy loss of the blends, with PFBDB‐T/C8‐ITIC‐based cells exhibiting a small energy loss of 0.6 eV combined with a high JSC of 19.6 mA cm−2."

Compared to unmethylated counterparts (ITCPTC), MeIC exhibits a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level value, tighter molecular packing, better crystallites quality, and stronger absorption in the range of 520–740 nm. The MeIC‐based polymer solar cells (PSCs) with J71 as donor, achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE), up to 12.54% with a short‐circuit current (JSC) of 18.41 mA cm−2, significantly higher than that of the device based on J71:ITCPTC (11.63% with a JSC of 17.52 mA cm−2). The higher JSC of the PSC based on J71:MeIC can be attributed to more balanced μh/μe, higher charge dissociation and charge collection efficiency, better molecular packing, and more proper phase separation features as indicated by grazing incident X‐ray diffraction and resonant soft X‐ray scattering results. It is worth mentioning that the as‐cast PSCs based on MeIC also yield a high PCE of 11.26%, which is among the highest value for the as‐cast nonfullerene PSCs so far. Such a small modification that leads to so significant an improvement of the photovoltaic performance is a quite exciting finding, shining a light on the molecular design of the nonfullerene acceptors."
112,10.1002/adma.201706363,"Relative to electron donors for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs), electron acceptors that absorb strongly in the visible and even near‐infrared region are less well developed, which hinders the further development of OSCs. Fullerenes as traditional electron acceptors have relatively weak visible absorption and limited electronic tunability, which constrains the optical and electronic properties required of the donor. Here, high‐performance fullerene‐free OSCs based on a combination of a medium‐bandgap polymer donor (FTAZ) and a narrow‐bandgap nonfullerene acceptor (IDIC), which exhibit complementary absorption, matched energy levels, and blend with pure phases on the exciton diffusion length scale, are reported. The single‐junction OSCs based on the FTAZ:IDIC blend exhibit power conversion efficiencies up to 12.5% with a certified value of 12.14%. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that exciting either the donor or the acceptor component efficiently generates mobile charges, which do not suffer from recombination to triplet states. Balancing photocurrent generation between the donor and nonfullerene acceptor removes undesirable constraints on the donor imposed by fullerene derivatives, opening a new avenue toward even higher efficiency for OSCs."

The two molecules reveal broad (600–900 nm) and strong absorption due to the satisfactory electron‐donating ability of INP. Compared with its counterpart INPIC, fluorinated nonfullerene acceptor INPIC‐4F exhibits a stronger near‐infrared absorption with a narrower optical bandgap of 1.39 eV, an improved crystallinity with higher electron mobility, and down‐shifted highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on INPIC‐4F exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.13% and a relatively low energy loss of 0.54 eV, which is among the highest efficiencies reported for binary OSCs in the literature. The results demonstrate the great potential of the new INP as an electron‐donating building block for constructing high‐performance nonfullerene acceptors for OSCs."
114,10.1002/adma.201707170,"Besides broadening of the absorption spectrum, modulating molecular energy levels, and other well‐studied properties, a stronger intramolecular electron push–pull effect also affords other advantages in nonfullerene acceptors. A strong push–pull effect improves the dipole moment of the wings in IT‐4F over IT‐M and results in a lower miscibility than IT‐M when blended with PBDB‐TF. This feature leads to higher domain purity in the PBDB‐TF:IT‐4F blend and makes a contribution to the better photovoltaic performance. Moreover, the strong push–pull effect also decreases the vibrational relaxation, which makes IT‐4F more promising than IT‐M in reducing the energetic loss of organic solar cells.

Here, a pair of nonfullerene small‐molecule acceptors, IT‐2Cl and IT‐4Cl, is designed and synthesized by introducing easy‐synthesis chlorine substituents onto the indacenodithieno[3,2‐b]thiophene units. The unique feature of the large dipole moment of the CCl bond enhances the intermolecular charge‐transfer effect between the donor–acceptor structures, and thus expands the absorption and down shifts the molecular energy levels. Meanwhile, the introduction of CCl also causes more pronounced molecular stacking, which also helps to expand the absorption spectrum. Both of the designed OSCs devices based on two acceptors can deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 13% when blended with a polymer donor with a low‐lying highest occupied molecular orbital level. In addition, since IT‐2Cl and IT‐4Cl have very good compatibility, a ternary OSC device integrating these two acceptors is also fabricated and obtains a PCE greater than 14%. Chlorination demonstrates effective ability in enhancing the device performance and facile synthesis route, which both deserve further exploitation in the modification of photovoltaic materials."

As a result, the PBDB‐T‐2Cl‐based PSCs exhibit higher open circuit voltage (Voc) than the PBDB‐T‐2F‐based devices, leading to an outstanding power conversion efficiency of over 14%.

The film-forming process was judiciously optimized by carefully manipulating the following four parameters: the additive content during film processing, the volume of the host solvent for solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the volume ratio of the additive versus the host solvent for SVA, and the time for SVA. Through such controls, the photocurrent dramatically increased from 5.40 to 12.83 mA/cm2 and the fill factor from 32.61 to 56.43% as a result of the reduction of the monomolecular and bimolecular loss and the improvement of the electron mobility.

Through systematic device optimization and characterization studies, we find that the nonfullerene analogues (FBM, CBM, and CDTBM) all perform comparably well, independent of the molecular structure and electronics of the π-bridge that links the two electron-deficient BM end groups.

134,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03323,"Two spirobifluorene (SF)-functioned 3D nonfullerene electron acceptors—SF-OR and SF-ORCN—that use rhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine as the terminal units, respectively, were designed and synthesized. These new acceptor materials show reversible electrochemical reduction and a high optical absorption coefficient, which are critical in device operation. Electronic and structural characterizations reveal that the inclusion of cyano group on rhodanine improve the electron accepting ability at the sacrifice of structure order, since the conjugated backbone becomes less planar, which prohibits cofacial stacking. SF-OR and SF-ORCN show good photovoltaic performances when paired with a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) donor, and the optimized devices give power conversion efficiencies of 4.66% and 4.48%, respectively. These values are higher than that of fullerene acceptor-based control devices (3.55%), which are also among the best in small molecular nonfullerene acceptor organic solar cells based on ..."
135,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b04287,"This paper describes the synthesis and application of βTPB6 and βTPB6-C as electron acceptors for organic solar cells. Compound βTPB6 contains four covalently bonded PDIs with a BDT-Th core at the β-position. The free rotation of PDIs renders βTPB6 with varying molecular geometries. The cyclization of βTPB6 yields βTPB6-C with high rigidity of the molecular geometry and enlarged conjugated skeleton. The inverted solar cells based on βTPB6-C and PTB7-Th as the donor polymer exhibited the highest efficiency of 7.69% with Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 14.9 mAcm–2, and FF of 0.56, which is 31% higher than that for βTPB6 based devices. The larger fraction of βTPB6-C and PTB7-Th than that of βTPB6:PTB7-Th in a blend film takes a face-on orientation packing pattern for π-systems that benefits the charge transport and hence higher PCE value than that for βTPB6:PTB7-Th. It was also found that a proper DIO:DPE additive further enhances this trend, which results in an increase of the PCE value for βTPB6-C:PTB7-Th while decr..."

Both acceptors exhibit strong and broad absorption in the range from 500 to 720 nm as well as appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. Replacing the linear hexyl chains with the branched 2-ethylhexyl chains has a large impact on the film morphology of photoactive layers. In the blend film based on DTNIC8 bearing the branched alkyl chains, morphology with well-defined phase separation was observed. This optimal phase morphology yields efficient exciton dissociation, reduced bimolecular recombination, and enhanced and balanced charge carrier mobilities. Benefited from these factors, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PBDB-T:DTNIC8 deliver a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.03% with a high fill factor (FF) of 72.84%..."

IffBR exhibits peak UV–vis absorbance at 658 nm, which is complementary with the absorption profiles of the wide-bandgap conjugated polymers poly[4,8-bis(4,5-dihexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-alt-2-(2-butyloctyl)-5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole] (PBTA-BO) and the fullerene acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The ternary device constructed with PBTA-BO/PC71BM/IffBR as the light-absorption layer exhibited significantly better photovoltaic performance than those obtained from devices based on a bulk-heterojunction layer comprised of binary components. This improvement was attributed to the broadened absorbance, formation of cascade charge-transfer pathways, reduced nongeminate..."
138,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b01089,"An angular-shaped 4,9-didodecylnaphthodithiophene-based octacyclic ladder-type structure was developed. This new ladder-type donor (LD) was coupled with electron-withdrawing IC and FIC units to form two A-LD-A type non-fullerene acceptor materials, NCIC and NCFIC. NCIC and NCFIC as the n-type acceptors are blended with a p-type donor PBDB-T to form the complementary absorption and suitable energy level alignments. The binary-blend PBDB-T:NCIC and PBDB-T:NCFIC devices achieved an efficiency of 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively.

It is interesting to find that the Voc of the ternary-blend devices is reversely in proportional to the added amount of PC71BM. The device using the PBDB-T:NCIC:PC71BM (1:1:1 in wt %) showed a..."
139,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b02276,"Two novel non-fullerene acceptors, SN6IC and SN6IC-4F, based on an S,N-heteroacene backbone were designed and synthesized. The cyclopentadiene fragments of commonly used acceptors were replaced with pyrrole rings to improve the electron-donating ability to increase the energy levels of the molecules. Both acceptors match well with the absorption and energy levels of the polymer donor PBDB-T, and PBDB-T:SN6IC-4F-based solar cells showed an excellent power conversion efficiency of 13.2%, with a relatively small VOC loss of 0.54 eV. This study proves that the introduction of a nitrogen atom to replace the sp3-hybridized carbon in the fused ring is very effective for making highly efficient NFAs to further improve the performance of organic solar cells."

The optoelectronic properties of these molecules were fine-tuned with the objective of attaining strong absorption at longer wavelengths by changing the low-ionization-potential moiety. The electron-accepting function of these materials was investigated with poly(3-n-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a standard electron donor. Significant photocurrent generation in the near infrared region, with an external quantum yield reaching as high as 22 % at 700 nm and an onset >800 nm was achieved. The results support efficient hole transfer to P3HT taking place after light absorption by the acceptor molecules. A Channel II-dominated power conversion efficiency of up to 1.5 % was, thus, achieved."

This molecule exhibits a low band gap (Eg = 1.52 eV), strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region and a high LUMO level (−3.79 eV). When a large band gap polymer J51 (Eg = 1.91 eV) was used as the donor, complementary absorption of the polymer donor and acceptor was obtained in the wavelength range of 350–850 nm.

Moreover, this performance is much higher than that of J51:PC71BM based PSCs under similar device fabrication conditions (PCE = 6.0%). The trade-off features of the Jsc and Voc existing in PSCs with fullerene acceptors have been minimized in the fullerene-free PSCs based on IDSe-T-IC and J51.

146,10.1039/c7ee00844a,"Low-bandgap polymers/molecules are an interesting family of semiconductor materials, and have enabled many recent exciting breakthroughs in the field of organic electronics, especially for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here, such a low-bandgap (1.43 eV) non-fullerene electron acceptor (BT-IC) bearing a fused 7-heterocyclic ring with absorption edge extending to the near-infrared (NIR) region was specially designed and synthesized. Benefitted from its NIR light harvesting, high performance OPVs were fabricated with medium bandgap polymers (J61 and J71) as donors, showing power conversion efficiencies of 9.6% with J61 and 10.5% with J71 along with extremely low energy loss (0.56 eV for J61 and 0.53 eV for J71). Interestingly, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy studies on both systems show that efficient charge generation was observed despite the fact that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–HOMO offset (ΔEH) in the blends was as low as 0.10 eV, suggesting that such a small ΔEH is not a crucial limitation in realizing high performance of NIR non-fullerene based OPVs. Our results indicated that BT-IC is an interesting NIR non-fullerene acceptor with great potential application in tandem/multi-junction, semitransparent, and ternary blend solar cells."
147,10.1039/c8ee00215k,"Non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) attract more attention due to the constantly refreshed power conversion efficiency (PCE) based on the versatile non-fullerene acceptors. In this work, PCEs of 10.51% and 11.02% were obtained for two kinds of non-fullerene PSC with IDT6CN-M or ITCPTC as the acceptor and PBDB-T as the donor. ITCPTC has a relatively narrow bandgap and a high absorption coefficient compared with IDT6CN-M, which explains well the relatively large short-circuit current density of 17.44 mA cm−2 for the ITCPTC based binary PSCs. Meanwhile, the IDT6CN-M based binary PSCs exhibit a relatively high fill factor (FF) of 75.3% and an open-circuit voltage of 0.915 V. A PCE of 11.92% and a FF of 76.5% were achieved for the ternary PSCs with 60 wt% ITCPTC content in the acceptors, which should be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting and their good compatibility for a synergistic improvement of exciton utilization and charge transport in the ternary active layers.

149,10.1021/ja508472j,"New electron-acceptor materials are long sought to overcome the small photovoltage, high-cost, poor photochemical stability, and other limitations of fullerene-based organic photovoltaics. However, all known nonfullerene acceptors have so far shown inferior photovoltaic properties compared to fullerene benchmark [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), and there are as yet no established design principles for realizing improved materials. Herein we report a design strategy that has produced a novel multichromophoric, large size, nonplanar three-dimensional (3D) organic molecule, DBFI-T, whose π-conjugated framework occupies space comparable to an aggregate of 9 [C60]-fullerene molecules. Comparative studies of DBFI-T with its planar monomeric analogue (BFI-P2) and PC60BM in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, by using a common thiazolothiazole-dithienosilole copolymer donor (PSEHTT), showed that DBFI-T has superior charge photogeneration and photovoltaic properties; PSEHTT:DBFI-T solar cells combined a high short-circuit current (10.14 mA/cm(2)) with a high open-circuit voltage (0.86 V) to give a power conversion efficiency of 5.0%. The external quantum efficiency spectrum of PSEHTT:DBFI-T devices had peaks of 60-65% in the 380-620 nm range, demonstrating that both hole transfer from photoexcited DBFI-T to PSEHTT and electron transfer from photoexcited PSEHTT to DBFI-T contribute substantially to charge photogeneration. The superior charge photogeneration and electron-accepting properties of DBFI-T were further confirmed by independent Xenon-flash time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, which correctly predict the relative magnitudes of the conversion efficiencies of the BHJ solar cells: PSEHTT:DBFI-T > PSEHTT:PC60BM > PSEHTT:BFI-P2. The results demonstrate that the large size, multichromophoric, nonplanar 3D molecular design is a promising approach to more efficient organic photovoltaic materials."
150,10.1021/ja508814z,"Perylenediimide (PDI)-based acceptors offer a potential replacement for fullerenes in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). The most promising efforts have focused on creating twisted PDI dimers to disrupt aggregation and thereby suppress excimer formation. Here, we present an alternative strategy for developing high-performance OPVs based on PDI acceptors that promote slip-stacking in the solid state, thus preventing the coupling necessary for rapid excimer formation. This packing structure is accomplished by substitution at the PDI 2,5,8,11-positions (""headland positions""). Using this design principle, three PDI acceptors, N,N-bis(n-octyl)-2,5,8,11-tetra(n-hexyl)-PDI (Hexyl-PDI), N,N-bis(n-octyl)-2,5,8,11-tetraphenethyl-PDI (Phenethyl-PDI), and N,N-bis(n-octyl)-2,5,8,11-tetraphenyl-PDI (Phenyl-PDI), were synthesized, and their molecular and electronic structures were characterized. They were then blended with the donor polymer PBTI3T, and inverted OPVs of the structure ITO/ZnO/Active Layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated and characterized. Of these, 1:1 PBTI3T:Phenyl-PDI proved to have the best performance with Jsc = 6.56 mA/cm(2), Voc = 1.024 V, FF = 54.59%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 3.67%. Devices fabricated with Phenethyl-PDI and Hexyl-PDI have significantly lower performance. The thin film morphology and the electronic and photophysical properties of the three materials are examined, and although all three materials undergo efficient charge separation, PBTI3T:Phenyl-PDI is found to have the deepest LUMO, intermediate crystallinity, and the most well-mixed domains. This minimizes geminate recombination in Phenyl-PDI OPVs and affords the highest PCE. Thus, slip-stacked PDI strategies represent a promising approach to fullerene replacements in BHJ OPVs."

A straightforward synthesis route was employed, offering the potential for large scale preparation of this material. Inverted OPV devices employing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor polymer and FBR as the acceptor gave power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 4.1%. Transient and steady state optical spectroscopies indicated efficient, ultrafast charge generation and efficient photocurrent generation from both donor and acceptor. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate polaron generation efficiency as well as recombination dynamics. It was determined that the P3HT:FBR blend is highly intermixed, leading to increased charge generation relative to comparative devices with P3HT:PC60BM, but also faster recombination due to a nonideal morphology in which, in contrast to P3HT:PC60BM devices, the acceptor does not aggregate enough to create appropriate percolation pathways that prevent fast nongeminate recombination. Despite this nonoptimal morphology the P3HT:FBR devices exhibit better performance than P3HT:PC60BM devices, used as control, demonstrating that this acceptor shows great promise for further optimization."

153,10.1021/jacs.5b11149,"Non-fullerene acceptors have recently attracted tremendous interest because of their potential as alternatives to fullerene derivatives in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have lagged far behind those of the polymer/fullerene system, mainly because of the low fill factor (FF) and photocurrent. Here we report a novel perylene bisimide (PBI) acceptor, SdiPBI-Se, in which selenium atoms were introduced into the perylene core. With a well-established wide-band-gap polymer (PDBT-T1) as the donor, a high efficiency of 8.4% with an unprecedented high FF of 70.2% is achieved for solution-processed non-fullerene organic solar cells. Efficient photon absorption, high and balanced charge carrier mobility, and ultrafast charge generation processes in PDBT-T1:SdiPBI-Se films account for the high photovoltaic performance.

To further increase power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices, it is of a great challenge to develop suitable polymer donor material that matches well with the low bandgap n-OS acceptors thus providing complementary absorption and nanoscaled blend morphology, as well as suppressed recombination and minimized energy loss. To address this challenge, we synthesized three medium bandgap 2D-conjugated bithienyl-benzodithiophene-alt-fluorobenzotriazole copolymers J52, J60, and J61 for the application as donor in the PSCs with low bandgap n-OS ITIC as acceptor. The three polymers were designed with branched alkyl (J52), branched alkylthio (J60), and linear alkylthio (J61) substituent on the thiophene conjugated side chain of the benzodithiophene (BDT) units for studying effect of the substituents on the photovoltaic performance of the polymers. The alkylthio side chain, red-shifted absorption down-shifted the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and improved crystallinity of the 2D conjugated polymers. With linear alkylthio side chain, the tailored polymer J61 exhibits an enhanced JSC of 17.43 mA/cm(2), a high VOC of 0.89 V, and a PCE of 9.53% in the best non-fullerene PSCs with the polymer as donor and ITIC as acceptor.

In a comparison with its isomeric counterpart ITIC with para-alkyl-phenyl substitution, m-ITIC shows a higher film absorption coefficient, a larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of m-ITIC resulted in a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.77% for the nonfullerene PSCs with m-ITIC as acceptor and a medium bandgap polymer J61 as donor, which is significantly improved over that (10.57%) of the corresponding devices with ITIC as acceptor. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 11.77% is one of the highest values reported in the literature to date for nonfullerene PSCs. More importantly, the m-ITIC-based device shows less thickness-dependent photovoltaic behavior than ITIC-based devices in the active-layer thickness range of 80-360 nm, which is beneficial for large area device fabrication. These results indicate that m-ITIC is a promising low bandgap n-OS for the application as an acceptor in PSCs, and the side-chain isomerization could be an easy and convenient way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the donor and acceptor materials for high efficiency PSCs."

By comparing the fused and nonfused SMAs, we show that the ring-fusion introduces several beneficial effects on the properties and performances of the acceptor material, including more favorable energy levels, enhanced light absorption and stronger intermolecular packing. Interestingly, morphology data reveal that the fused molecule yields higher domain purity and thus can better maintain its molecular packing and electron mobility in the blend. Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that FTTB-PDI4 exhibits a ""double-decker"" geometry with two pairs of mostly parallel PDI units, which is distinctively different from reported PDI-tetramers with highly twisted geometries and can explain the better performance of the material.

161,10.1021/jacs.8b02695,"To simultaneously achieve low photon energy loss ( Eloss) and broad spectral response, the molecular design of the wide band gap (WBG) donor polymer with a deep HOMO level is of critical importance in fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we developed a new benzodithiophene unit, i.e., DTBDT-EF, and conducted systematic investigations on a WBG DTBDT-EF-based donor polymer, namely, PDTB-EF-T. Due to the synergistic electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atom and ester group, PDTB-EF-T exhibits a higher oxidation potential, i.e., a deeper HOMO level (ca. -5.5 eV) than most well-known donor polymers. Hence, a high open-circuit voltage of 0.90 V was obtained when paired with a fluorinated small molecule acceptor (IT-4F), corresponding to a low Eloss of 0.62 eV. Furthermore, side-chain engineering demonstrated that subtle side-chain modulation of the ester greatly influences the aggregation effects and molecular packing of polymer PDTB-EF-T. With the benefits of the stronger interchain π-π interaction, the improved ordering structure, and thus the highest hole mobility, the most symmetric charge transport and reduced recombination are achieved for the linear decyl-substituted PDTB-EF-T (P2)-based PSCs, leading to the highest short-circuit current density and fill factor (FF). Due to the high Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (χ), surface-directed phase separation occurs in the P2:IT-4F blend, which is supported by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy results and cross-sectional transmission electron microscope images. By taking advantage of the vertical phase distribution of the P2:IT-4F blend, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2% with an outstanding FF of 0.76 was recorded for inverted devices. These results demonstrate the great potential of the DTBDT-EF unit for future organic photovoltaic applications."
162,10.1021/jacs.8b05834,"Minimization of open-circuit-voltage ( VOC) loss is required to transcend the efficiency limitations on the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV). We study charge recombination in an OPV blend comprising a polymer donor with a small molecule nonfullerene acceptor that exhibits both high photovoltaic internal quantum efficiency and relatively high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency. Notably, this donor/acceptor blend, consisting of the donor polymer commonly referred to as PCE10 with a pseudoplanar small molecule acceptor (referred to as FIDTT-2PDI) exhibits relatively bright delayed photoluminescence on the microsecond time scale beyond that observed in the neat material. We study the photoluminescence decay kinetics of the blend in detail and conclude that this long-lived photoluminescence arises from radiative nongeminate recombination of charge carriers, which we propose occurs via a donor/acceptor CT state located close in energy to the singlet state of the polymer donor. Additionally, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies point toward low subgap disorder, which could be beneficial for low radiative and nonradiative losses. These results provide an important demonstration of photoluminescence due to nongeminate charge recombination in an efficient OPV blend, a key step in identifying new OPV materials and materials-screening criteria if OPV is to approach the theoretical limits to efficiency."
163,10.1039/c3ta14839d,"Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices consisting of a novel non-fullerene acceptor based on a decacyclene triimide core and the common polymer donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) exhibit good power conversion efficiency (∼1.6%) as-cast. However, thermal annealing results in a drastic decrease in both the efficiency and the electron current. Polarized soft X-ray spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray scattering reveal that thermal annealing results in a reorientation of the acceptor molecules to an edge-on orientation with their π–π stacking direction predominantly in-plane with the substrate and overall hexagonal packing among planar columnar structures. This packing motif greatly hinders vertical electron transport in bulk heterojunction films. Furthermore, in situ X-ray scattering studies show that this critical reorientation occurs even at relatively low temperatures (∼60 °C). These results are some of the first to highlight differences between the morphology of non-fullerene and fullerene-based bulk heterojunctions and critical parameters that must be controlled when designing future high-performance non-fullerene acceptor molecules."
164,10.1039/c4ta02851a,"The aggregate-induced limitation for high power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perylene-diimide (PDI):polymer solar cells can be circumvented when two simple rules are respected; the aggregate size of PDI remains short enough and the omnipresent PDI aggregates are electronically interconnected. Following these guidelines, a PCE of 3.7% is delivered by using the solution-processable, planar PDI monomer of N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide as the electron acceptor mixed with the low-energy gap polymeric donor poly[(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene))-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-CT). The PBDTTT-CT:PDI composite absorbs strongly the light in the region of 400 nm–800 nm and after adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) efficient photocurrent generation is achieved. Space-charge limited dark current and transient photovoltage measurements suggest that the use of the DIO component optimizes the electron/hole carrier mobility ratio, suppresses the non-geminate recombination losses and improves the charge extraction efficiency."

IDT–2BM and IDTT–2BM exhibited strong and broad absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and appropriate LUMO (−3.8 eV) and HOMO (−5.5 to −5.6 eV) levels matching with the classical polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T. IDT–2BM and IDTT–2BM films exhibited intrinsic electron mobilities of about 3.7 × 10−6 and 1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Fullerene-free PSCs employing PBDTTT-C-T as the donor and IDT–2BM or IDTT–2BM as the acceptor afforded power conversion efficiencies of 4.26% and 4.81%, respectively."
169,10.1039/c6ta08870h,"Herein we present the design of three perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives with different molecular geometries; namely the monomeric PDI1, the bay-linked PDI2 dimer, and the bay-linked PDI4 tetramer with a 9,9′-spirobifluorene core that are utilized as electron acceptors in non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). In all cases the PTB7-Th polymer is used as the electron donor. Among the three PTB7-Th:PDI systems, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) is obtained by the PDI4-based OSC device that exhibits a maximum PCE = 6.44% followed by the PDI2-based (PCE = 5.32%) and PDI1-based (PCE = 2.48%) devices. The detailed study of the photoluminescence quenching, morphology and temperature-dependent charge transport properties of the three systems reveal that the highest PCE of PTB7-Th:PDI4 is a consequence of the three-dimensional (3D) molecular architecture of PDI4 that tunes energetic disorder in the PDI phase and contributes to the improvement of electron transport. Transient photovoltage characterization experiments further identify that the actual effect coming from the 3D molecular geometry of the PDI4 acceptor on PCE is the minimization of non-geminate charge recombination losses. This study provides updated guidelines for optimizing further the molecular structure of 3D small molecular electron acceptors that can be used in highly efficient non-fullerene OSCs."

After optimization, i.e. donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapour annealing, the polymer solar cells exhibited power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.86% and 7.19% for DPP7 and DPP8 as acceptors, respectively. These results indicate that slight changes in the chemical structure of the small acceptor molecule significantly increase the efficiency of the device. The design and synthesis of these non-fullerene acceptors with broader absorption spectra extended towards the near infrared region may be key for the further development of high-performance and cost-effective solution-processed organic solar cells."
171,10.1039/c6ta10450a,"Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are becoming a serious contender to fullerene-based electron acceptors in organic photovoltaics, due to their structural versatility and easily tunable optical and electronic properties. However, NFA-based solar cells often have a decreased short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) compared to their fullerene-based counterparts. Here, we investigate the fundamental causes of this decrease in the performance of solar cells using a non-fullerene acceptor (SF-PDI2) paired with two polymer donors, FTAZ and PyCNTAZ, compared with their fullerene-based counterparts. Through a number of experimental techniques and morphological studies, we show that the SF-PDI2-based solar cells suffer from insufficient charge generation, transport, and collection when compared with the PCBM-based solar cells. The SF-PDI2-based solar cells show increased bimolecular recombination, which, together with other recombination loss mechanisms in these cells, causes a significant decrease in their Jsc and FF. Notably, the less pure domains, low electron mobility (on the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and imbalanced mobility (in regard to the hole mobility) further explain the low FF. On the other hand, the higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the SF-PDI2 devices is mainly due to the increase in the CT state energy. It is worth mentioning that the PyCNTAZ-based devices show an ultralow charge separation energy (ΔECS), close to 0 eV. Our results demonstrate that further increasing the mobility (both of electrons and holes) in these NFA-based solar cells would be a viable approach to further enhance the efficiency of these new types of solar cells, ideally, without losing the high Voc of such cells."
172,10.1039/c7ta01143a,"Ladder-type dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) cores, which possess highly extended π-conjugated backbones and versatile modular structures for derivatization, were widely used to develop high-performance p-type polymeric semiconductors. However, an n-type DTCC-based organic semiconductor has not been reported to date. In this study, the first DTCC-based n-type organic semiconductor (DTCC–IC) with a well-defined A–D–A backbone was designed, synthesized, and characterized, in which a DTCC derivative substituted by four p-octyloxyphenyl groups was used as the electron-donating core and two strongly electron-withdrawing 3-(dicyanomethylene)indan-1-one moieties were used as the terminal acceptors. It was found that DTCC–IC has strong light-capturing ability in the range of 500–720 nm and exhibits an impressively high molar absorption coefficient of 2.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 669 nm owing to effective intramolecular charge transfer and a strong D–A effect. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTCC–IC are −5.50 and −3.87 eV, respectively. More importantly, a high electron mobility of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was determined by the space-charge-limited current method; this electron mobility can be comparable to that of fullerene derivative acceptors (μe ∼ 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). To investigate its application potential in non-fullerene solar cells, we fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) by blending a DTCC–IC acceptor with a PTB7-Th donor under various conditions. The results suggest that the optimized device exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6% and a rational high VOC of 0.95 V. These findings demonstrate that the ladder-type DTCC core is a promising building block for the development of high-mobility n-type organic semiconductors for OSCs."
173,10.1039/c7ta02141k,"Three planar nonfullerene acceptors (FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8) comprising a central fluorenedicyclopentathiophene (FT) core and two 2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone) terminal groups are designed and synthesized. The coplanarity of the molecular backbone can be maintained through a locked conformation via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The solubility of these nonfullerene acceptors is very good because the FT core can bear enough flexible aliphatic side-chain substitutions. Thus, the dilemma of the planarity–solubility tradeoff can be minimized. Through changing the length of the six flexible aliphatic side chains at the central FT core, we can easily adjust the π–π interactions of nonfullerene acceptors and optimize the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layers. Among these three small molecular acceptors, FTIC-C6C8 based active layers show the best morphology together with the highest electron and hole mobility. These inherent advantages of FTIC-C6C8 guarantee it a high power conversion efficiency of 11.12% when used in non-fullerene polymer solar cells with a wide-bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T. Our results provide an appropriate molecular design strategy for building high-performance nonfullerene acceptors and show that optimizing alkyl-side chains is a very effective way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of devices."

Compared to the analogous polymer J61 with linear dodecylthio side chains in the BDTT unit and a long 2-hexyldecyl side chain in BTz-2F, PSBZ possesses branched 2-butyloctyl side chains to increase steric hindrance of the BDTT unit and a short 2-butyloctyl side chain to decrease steric hindrance of the BTz-2F unit for more efficient charge separation and transport in the devices. As a result, PSBZ exhibited stronger π–π interaction and smaller stacking spacing leading to a higher extinction coefficient of 1.48 × 105 cm−1 and a high hole mobility of 8.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to the analogous polymer J61 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.53% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.43 mA cm−2, the PSBZ:ITIC-based polymer solar cells yielded a higher PCE of 10.5% with a higher Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2.

The oligomers showed strong absorptions in the red and near-IR region in solution and in the solid state. As a consequence of the strong electron-accepting character, the absorption band of DCI-2 in thin films is significantly red-shifted compared to that of PY-1 resulting in a low optical energy gap of 1.23 eV. In optimized solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells using a polymeric donor P1, the new non-fullerene acceptor DCI-2 provides an excellent power conversion efficiency of 6.94% which is noticeably higher than that of PY-1-based devices (PCE = 4.89%).

ATT-3 shows a planar backbone configuration facilitating charge transport and exhibits strong and broad absorption ranging from 300 to 770 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.61 eV. ATT-3 shows a complementary absorption and well-matched HOMO and LUMO energy levels with P3HT. P3HT:ATT-3-based PSCs show a high PCE of 6.26% with a high Voc of 0.927 V and a small energy loss of 0.68 eV, which is comparable to the best value obtained by using an O-IDTBR acceptor."

However, this fluorine effect has not been well-studied in systems containing new, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Here, we investigate the impact of donor polymer fluorination in NFA-based solar cells by fabricating devices with either a fluorinated conjugated polymer (FTAZ) or its non-fluorinated counterpart (HTAZ) as the donor polymer and a small molecule NFA (ITIC) as the acceptor. We found that, similar to fullerene-based devices, fluorination leads to an increased open circuit voltage (Voc) from the lowered HOMO level and improved fill factor (FF) from the higher charge carrier mobility. More importantly, donor polymer fluorination in this NFA-based system also led to a large increase in short circuit current (Jsc), which stems from the improved charge transport and extraction in the fluorinated device. This study demonstrates that fluorination is also advantageous in NFA-based PSCs and may improve performance to a higher extent than in fullerene-based PSCs. In the context of other recent reports on demonstrating higher photovoltaic device efficiencies with fluorinated materials, fluorination appears to be a valuable strategy in the design and synthesis of future donors and acceptors for PSCs."

Encouragingly, the OSCs based on ITIC-OE show a high power conversion efficiency of 8.5%, which is the highest value for OSCs that employ high dielectric constant materials. Nevertheless, this value is lower than those of ITIC-based control devices. The less phase-separated morphology in blend films due to the reduced crystallinity of ITIC-OE and the too good miscibility between PBDB-T and ITIC-OE are responsible for the lower device performance.

Chlorine atoms were directly attached to the backbones of the polymers, which induced non-ignorable steric hindrance because of the relatively large size of chlorine. To overcome this influence, a structural design of extended conjugated thiophene units was further introduced to increase the π–π interactions. In this way, two new chlorinated D–A polymers were developed that combined two-dimensional thiophene conjugated side chains for enhanced intermolecular interactions with chlorine atoms for an elevated open-circuit voltage in photovoltaic devices. As a result of chlorination, which substantially changed the charge distribution along the polymer backbone through its electron-withdrawing nature and resonance effect, the two polymers exhibited deep-lying HOMO levels and blueshifted absorbances for more complementary light absorption with a non-fullerene acceptor, such as ITIC. By taking advantage of the synergistic chlorination of the backbone and the introduction of conjugated thiophene side chains, the optimized bulk heterojunction device based on 2D-PBTCl and ITIC showed a PCE of 8.81% compared to the PCE of PTB7-Th of 6.91%, which corresponds to an approximately 28% improvement in solar energy conversion.

In this work, we change the alkoxy substituted fluorobenzene side chains to alkyl substituted fluorothiophene in the Qx unit and employ the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit with different lengths of alkyl thiophene side chains to obtain two new Qx based polymers, named TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2, respectively. The TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend film has clear nanoscale phase separation and a suitable domain size, and the device with the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend film shows lower geminate recombination and higher charge mobility than those with TTFQx-T2:ITIC. Therefore, the TTFQx-T1:ITIC based device exhibits a higher PCE of 10.52% than that based on the TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend with a moderate PCE of 7.22%. The inverted devices from TTFQx-T1:ITIC blends with a larger active area of 16 mm2 than the conventional device (4.5 mm2) show a good PCE of 9.21%. The results highlight that the alkyl lengths and the kinds of aromatic rings in side chains are significant for the development of high performance photovoltaic polymers.

The difference in PCEs between the devices based on J71 and PBDB-T is mainly ascribed to the gap of the open circuit voltage. It should be mentioned that the J71-based device exhibited an energy loss of 0.62 eV, which is significantly lower than the most reported energy loss. For the low band-gap polymer donor PCE-10, the device also showed a relatively high PCE of 8.34%. The different device performances are analyzed in depth from charge transport and collection, to recombination loss mechanism and morphology of blend films. This work reveals that the new n-type organic semiconductor is very promising as a universal nonfullerene acceptor, pairing with different band-gap polymer donors."
188,10.1039/c8ta00783g,"Two non-fullerene acceptors with selenophene π bridges to link the indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) or difluorinated IC (2F-IC) terminals, i.e.IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F, were synthesized. IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F have low optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.45 and 1.39 eV, respectively. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on them were fabricated with the wide band gap polymer PBDB-T as the donor. A wide photo-current response extending to 850 and 900 nm was observed for the IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F based devices, respectively. Besides, the PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend film exhibited higher electron mobility and more balanced hole and electron transport ascribed to the higher packing order of IDT2Se-4F in the blends and a proper phase-separated morphology. As a result, the IDT2Se-4F based devices delivered a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.19% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.49 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 65.9%, whereas the devices based on IDT2Se showed a lower maximum PCE of 9.36%."

The nonfullerene BHJ devices with the SM acceptor D5T6F-M achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to ca. 4.5% (vs. ca. 2% for D7T8F-M-based devices). Our study shows that –F substitutions in SM systems – otherwise used as donors – is an effective approach in the design of nonfullerene acceptors for efficient BHJ solar cells with polymer donors."
190,10.1039/c8ta03753a,"Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors have been increasing rapidly over the last couple of years, little is known about the correlations between molecular structures and blend morphologies. In this work, we design and synthesize three acceptor–donor–core–donor–acceptor (A–D–C–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptors, HF–PCIC, HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC, which possess the same electron-donating parts (D) and electron-accepting terminals (A), but different benzene-based cores (C). We observe that such minor chemical variations can lead to distinct differences in their photovoltaic properties. The resulting PSCs based on HF–PCIC with a 2,5-difluorobenzene core yield a good PCE of 10.97%, which is higher than those of HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC based PSCs (8.36% and 9.09%). If the processing solvent is changed from chlorobenzene to chloroform, a further improved PCE of 11.49% is obtained for HF–PCIC-based PSCs due to the formation of finer phase separation domains. This is the highest value among the PSCs with non-fullerene acceptors possessing unfused cores. Through a series of characterization techniques, we disclose that the diverse benzene-based cores influence the molecular geometries of the three non-fullerene acceptors, resulting in varied molecular packing modes and film morphologies. The results suggest that the tuning of non-fullerene acceptors' geometries is an effective method to optimize the film morphology and thus the photovoltaic properties. The unfused-core in A–D–C–D–A small molecules provides a good building block to construct high-performance non-fullerene acceptors."

Our new design with tetrahedral configuration (or 3D) could be an efficient approach to increase the PCE of OSCs with non-fullerene acceptors."
192,10.1039/c6tc05107c,"The geometry of organic π-conjugated small molecules can impact the morphology of blended-thin films and subsequent performance in opto-electronic devices. In this report, we investigate the role of molecular conformation of perylene diimide (PDI) dimers designed to act as non-fullerene acceptors in organic solar cells. A series of three PDI dimers is presented in which the PDI chromophores are directly linked via the bay position (PDI2, 3) or separated by one (PDI2Ac, 4) or two (PDI2Ac2, 5) acetylene spacers. In all cases, the exo-position of the PDI dimers is N-annulated. New compounds 4 and 5 were synthesized via an optimized and facile synthetic pathway. Directly linked PDI dimers adopted a highly twisted conformation whereas adding two acetylene spacers rendered the PDI chromophores coplanar. 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of each dimer revealed a highly sensitive electronic structure that is strongly influenced by the acetylene spacers. It was found that compounds 4 and 5 with less twisted structures exhibited similar electron affinities but lower ionization potentials, lower organic solvent solubility, and red-shifted optical absorption spectra when compared to the highly twisted dimer 3. In addition, 4 and 5 showed a stronger tendency to aggregate in both solution and the solid state. This had a large impact on the performance of organic solar cells using these materials as electron acceptors. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells based upon a PTB7-Th:3 active layer could reach high power conversion efficiencies of 5.23%. In contrast, PTB7-Th:4 and PTB7-Th:5 based devices had ∼5 times lower performance owing to the formation of unfavourable active layer morphologies."
193,10.1039/c7tc00706j,"Herein, a new asymmetric n-type semiconducting molecule (PhITBD) with an indenothiophene core was designed, synthesized using tethering 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)-malononitrile (BM) as terminal groups, and applied to polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PSCs with asymmetric PhITBD displayed improved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6.57% as compared to those with the symmetric molecule IDT-2BM. The higher PCE value of the PhITBD-based PSC was mainly attributed to the enhanced photovoltaic properties, the Voc, Jsc, FF induced by complementary light absorption (550–600 nm range), morphological improvement, and balanced charge carrier transport in the active layer. Due to the effective morphological control and absorption enhancement, asymmetric structured n-type-conjugated molecules are potential candidates for improving the performance of bulk heterojunction non-fullerene type PSCs."
194,10.1039/c7tc02098h,"A series of D–A copolymers (P1–P3) based on a thiophene fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit and a 4,8-bis(4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTFT) unit have been designed and synthesized as electron-donating materials for non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) with ITIC as an electron-accepting material. The fusion of a thiophene ring with a BTAZ unit and introduction of a fluorine atom at the BDTT unit have been concurrently performed to regulate the absorption properties and energy levels, and two different alkyl side-chains have also been introduced to BTAZT and BDTFT units, respectively, to investigate the influence of side-chains on the properties of the polymers as well as the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs. The photovoltaic performance evaluation in combination with morphology characterization indicates that the introduction of a 2-ethylhexyl group simultaneously at BTAZT and BDTFT units is favourable for intermolecular π–π interaction that improves the morphologies and crystalline domain of P1:ITIC blend film, thus enhancing the charge mobility and the short-circuit current density (Jsc). But the large steric hindrance of the 2-butyloctyl group to replace the 2-ethylhexyl group at BDTFT (P2) or BTAZT (P3) deteriorates intermolecular interaction that leads to the decrease of charge mobility and poor Jsc. Thus, P1 based PSCs exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.14% with the best Jsc (14.11 ± 0.27 mA cm−2) and fill factor (63.41 ± 1.46%) among P1–P3 polymers."

196,10.1039/c7tc04750a,"Non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their good optical absorption and convenient structure modification. Some small molecular acceptors such as ITIC have exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance. Based on these acceptors, it is very important to screen donor materials to further improve the performance. The benzotriazole-based polymer is an important type of donor material, especially for non-fullerene PSCs. We have designed and synthesized a type of benzotriazole-based conjugated polymer with a 2D expanded side chain. These polymers exhibit good crystallinity in films. Non-fullerene PSC devices based on polymer:ITIC show a PCE of 8.03% with a high JSC of over 17 mA cm−2, which might be attributed to its good crystallinity.

Compared with conventional SubPc-based acceptors with optical absorption full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of less than 100 nm and optical bandgaps over 2 eV, both E-SubPc-PDI and S-SubPc-PDI possess broader absorption spectra with FWHM values of up to 170 nm and smaller optical bandgaps below 1.9 eV. Due to the different linkages between SubPc and PDIs, they exhibit different molecular geometries, optical properties, energy levels and stacking behaviors. With a more twisted molecular structure, the single bond linked S-SubPc-PDI exhibits reduced intermolecular aggregation and a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level compared to the acetylene bridge-linked E-SubPc-PDI. When blending with a donor polymer PBDB-T, the active layer of PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI shows more favorable phase separation and more balanced carrier transport. As a result, solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) based on S-SubPc-PDI exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 4.53%, which is much higher than that of E-SubPc-PDI-based devices (1.78%)."

The intriguing geometry of the HPB core and the spatial repulsion of the PDI rings created a twisted three-dimensional propeller-shaped conformation for HPB-PDI6. The propeller-shaped conformation could prevent the acceptor molecules from forming large aggregates in the active layer. As expected, the PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 blend films show a favorable morphology as well as high and balanced charge carrier mobility. Devices based on PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 achieved a PCE of 6.63% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2, and an FF of 48.0%.

199,10.1039/c8tc03303j,"Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have great potential to replace the commonly used fullerene derivatives in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, PDI-based molecules have a strong tendency to aggregate in thin films, which prevents the formation of appropriate phase separation. To alleviate this problem, much effort has been devoted to developing twisted PDI dimers with functional bridges at bay positions. Unfortunately, the bay-functionalized PDI dimers exhibit relatively low electron mobilities due to the excessive twist geometry. To solve this dilemma, an efficient method is to functionalize the PDI at less sterically-encumbered ortho-positions. In this article, we synthesized two novel ortho-functionalized PDI dimers, namely PDI-2Th-PDI and PDI-ThFTh-PDI, and investigated the influence of the conjugated bridge length on the physical and photovoltaic properties of PDIs. After introducing a fluorene bridge between the thiophene units, PDI-ThFTh-PDI with the extended conjugate length possessed a relatively low-crystalline nature and therefore exhibited one order of magnitude lower electron mobility compared to PDI-2Th-PDI. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells fabricated with PDI-2Th-PDI as the electron acceptor and PTB7-Th as the electron donor is almost twice that of the solar cell with PDI-ThFTh-PDI as the acceptor. Our findings provide important guidelines for the design of more efficient ortho-functionalized PDI acceptors."

The optical band gaps and the energy levels of the polymers were modulated by the copolymerization of the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit with the various comonomers. Moreover, by incorporating alkylthio substituents, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the polymer donors were effectively reduced, and thus the open-circuit voltages (Voc) of the fullerene-free PSC devices were strongly improved.

216,10.1039/c7cp00494j,"In this work, we provide systematic studies on the non-fullerene solar cells based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymers as electron donors and a well-known electron acceptor ITIC. ITIC has been widely reported in non-fullerene solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10%, when it is combined with a wide band gap conjugated polymer, while its application in small band gap DPP polymers has never been reported. Herein, we select four DPP polymers containing different thienyl linkers, resulting in distinct absorption spectra, energy levels and crystalline properties. Non-fullerene solar cells based on DPP polymers as donors and ITIC as an acceptor show PCEs of 1.9-4.1% and energy loss of 0.55-0.82 eV. The PCEs are much lower than those of cells based on fullerene derivatives due to the poor miscibility between the DPP polymers and ITIC, as confirmed by the morphology and charge transport investigation. The results indicate that it is important to tune the miscibility between the donor and acceptor in order to realize optimized micro-phase separation, which can further enhance the performance of DPP polymer based non-fullerene solar cells."
217,10.1039/c3py00457k,"Two amphiphilic and highly twisting perylene diimide (PDI) dimers, Bis-PDI-BDT-EG, were synthesized by using 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) and 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy) BDT (BDT-O) as covalent bridges at the 7,7′-positions, while at the 1,1′-positions, they were functionalized with weakly solvophobic 2-methoxylethoxyl (EG) units. The subtle structural differences between BDT-O and BDT-T lead to distinct aggregation abilities: with respect to the over-strong aggregation ability of the BDT-O bridged dimer 2, the BDT-T bridged dimer 1 shows largely reduced aggregation ability and is solution-processable in the commonly used organic solvent. The highly twisted conformation between the PDI–BDT–PDI planes produced steric-pairing effects, which directed ordered packing of dimer 1. When dimer 1 was blended with P3HT in a weight D/A ratio of 1 : 2.5, the electron mobility (μe) was 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the best PCE was 1.72%. Slowing the solvent evaporation speed benefited the packing order of the PDI dimer, and the μe value was slightly increased to 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The best PCE was improved up to 1.87%. The μe was further increased up to 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the D/A ratio was decreased down to 1 : 2.2 and the best PCE of 1.95% was achieved. Solid absorption spectra and XRD data of the blended films supported the improvement of the packing order of the PDI dimer by slowing the solvent annealing speed. AFM images supported the largely reduced aggregation ability of dimer 1 when blended with P3HT. The observed phase size of 35 nm is formed under the slow solvent annealing speed and a D/A ratio of 1 : 2.2. Our results revealed that the amphiphilic nature of the bridged aromatic unit reduces the aggregation ability and facilitates the ordered packing of the PDI units, contributing to the improvement of efficiency."
218,10.1039/c4ra05584e,"A new organic small molecule, 2-((10-(6-(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazole-9-yl)hexyl)-10H-phenothiazine-7-yl)methylene) malononitrile named CSORG5 has been synthesized and successfully applied for organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells as a novel electron acceptor along with P3HT as a donor. The CSORG5 molecule possess facile synthesis, solution processability, visible light absorption, a properly matched lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level with conjugated polymers and moderate electron mobility, making the molecule an ideal acceptor for P3HT and other low band gap conjugated polymers. The BHJ organic solar cell constructed from a P3HT:CSORG5 (1:1) active layer processed from a DIO/THF solvent, exhibits a high open circuit voltage of up to 0.98 V resulting in an overall power conversion efficiency of 2.80%. Furthermore, the PCE is enhanced up to 4.16% when a thin layer of TiO2 is inserted between the active layer and the Al electrode."
219,10.1039/c5ra03607k,"Six small molecules with three different dye units, ethyl cyanoacetate (ECA), 1,3-indandione (IN), and 3-ethylrhodanine (RH), attached to both ends of thiophene-flanked carbazole (Cz) or fluorene (Flu) cores were synthesized and used as acceptors in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Their optical and electrochemical, and consequent photovoltaic parameters varied mainly according to the dye units. The OPV cells were fabricated with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly(3-hexylthiophene):small molecule/LiF/Al and all devices except for Cz-IN showed photovoltaic performances with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range of 1.03–3.08% and open-circuit voltages as high as 1.03 V. Among them, the ECA and RH series had relatively high open-circuit voltages values because of their high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels. Devices based on Flu-IN and the RH series showed high short-circuit currents (JSC) because of the strong molecular aggregation, as evidenced by red-shifted UV absorption from solution to film. The adequate molecular aggregation in Flu-IN and RH films enhanced electron transport between the molecules, resulting in devices with high JSC and PCE values. This work demonstrates that the introduction of dye end units onto carbazole- and fluorene-based small molecules provides good candidates for non-fullerene acceptors."
220,10.1002/smll.201401082,"Fullerene-based polymer solar cells (PSCs), namely utilizing polymers as electron donors and fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors, have been the subject of organic photovoltaic and the predominant type of polymer solar cells in the past decade. [ 1–6 ] Although fullerene derivatives like [6,6]-phenylC 61 (or C 71 )-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM or PC 71 BM) have made great success, they still have several drawbacks, including poor absorption of visible light for PC 61 BM and high cost for PC 71 BM, which limit their practical applications. [ 7 ] In contrast, non-fullerene acceptors can be easily produced in large scale at low cost and chemically modifi ed with highly tunable absorption spectra and energy levels than those of fullerene derivatives. [ 8,9 ] Encouragingly, Facchetti et al. [ 10 ] reported a record power conversion effi ciency (PCE) of ≈6.4% in polymer:polymer blend-based PSCs, which demonstrated the great potential of fullerene-free PSCs and signifi cantly promoted the research in the fi eld.

221,10.1002/smll.201704491,"In recent years, rapid advances are achieved in polymer solar cells (PSCs) using nonfullerene small molecular acceptors. However, no research disclosing the influence of molecular weight (Mn ) of conjugated polymer on the nonfullerene device performance is reported. In this work, a series of polymers with different Mn s are synthesized to systematically investigate the connection between Mn and performance of nonfullerene devices for the first time. It is found that the device performance improves substantially as the Mn increases from 12 to 38 kDa and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 10.5% is realized. It has to be noted this PCE is achieved without using any additives and post-treatments, which is among the top efficiencies of additive- and post-treatment-free PSCs. Most importantly, the variation trend of the optimal active layer thickness and morphology is significantly different from the device with fullerene as acceptor. The findings clarify the effect of Mn on the performance of nonfullerene PSCs, which would benefit further efficiency improvement of nonfullerene PSCs."
222,10.1039/c8ee01546e,"To achieve efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs), an in-depth understanding of the key properties that govern the power output is necessary. Herein, three trialkylsilyl substituted benzodithiophene-based polymer donors (PJ1, PJ2, and PJ3) were synthesized with fine-tuning of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and optical absorption. Using the polymer series paired with absorption-complementary small molecular acceptors (SMAs), namely, m-ITIC, IDIC, and AIDIC, we systematically studied the performance of a 3 × 3 matrix of NF-PSCs. An increasing open-circuit voltage with deepening HOMOs of the polymer donors, and the enhanced short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) were ascribed to the well-intermixed blend morphology containing enhanced SMA order ranges with mixed face-on and edge-on orientations, the so-called 3-D texture. Such an optimal microstructure is best exemplified in the PJ2:IDIC combination, affording a highest efficiency of 12.01% with a simultaneously high JSC of 17.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.3%. The devices with an active layer thickness of 300 nm still maintain an impressive efficiency approaching 10% with a decent FF of 60.0%. Moreover, the Channel II process, i.e., photoinduced hole transfer through acceptor excitation, was demonstrated to be crucially important for photocurrent generation. This study highlights the importance of optimizing the trade-off between charge separation/transport and domain size to achieve high-performance NF-PSCs."
