PTBFBz showed the strong absorption with a wide bandgap of 1.89 eV. Power conversion efficiency of nonfullerene polymer solar cells based on PTBFBz:ITIC with thermal and sequential solvent annealing reached up to 8.33%, which is the highest reported value among the asymmetrical TBF-based polymer solar cells.

However, for all polymer solar cells (APSCs), the PCEs lag far behind the non-fullerene PSCs with organic small molecular acceptors. And there have been no successful examples of high-efficiency APSCs along with low Vloss values so far. Here, we reported APSCs that demonstrated a high efficiency of 6.66% simultaneously with a small voltage loss of 0.56 V by using a new polymer PBDT-DFQX1 as donor and N2200 as acceptor. Notably, when PBDT-DFQX1 is combined with a small molecular acceptor (SMA) O-IDTBR, the relative SMA based PSC exhibited a higher PCE of 8.76% also with a low voltage loss of 0.56 V. These results indicated that PBDT-DFQX1 would be a promising polymer donor material in photovoltaic device application,..."

Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.6b08284,"Solvent additive has proven as a useful protocol for improving the film nanomorphology of polymer donor (D): fullerene acceptor (A) blends in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic cells. By contrast, the effect of such solvent additive on nonfullerene BHJ cells based on perylene diimide acceptor, for instance, is less effective because of their highly planar structure and strong π-aggregation in solid state. Here we choose N,N'-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene (PTB7) as a model D:A blend system to investigate how solvent engineering strategy synergistically impacts the blend film nanomorphology. Based on the differences of solvent volatility and solubility, various host solvents-chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) and solvent additives-chloronaphthalene (CN) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) are selected for comparative studies. It is found that the π-aggregation of PDIs can be largely suppressed by using low-boiling point (Tb) CF solvent, yet enlarged by using high-Tb CB. Moreover, CN additive provides good solubility of PDI molecules and hence reduces large PDI aggregates in CB system, while DIO exhibiting poor solubility works oppositely. By contrast, DIO that presents larger Tb difference with CF prolongs the film-forming, which assists in optimizing the PDI aggregation and increases the intermixed PTB7:PDI phases more significantly than CN in CF system, yielding the finest phase-separation morphology and balanced charge mobility. Consequently, the inverted BHJ cells based on CF-processed PTB7:PDI blend film with 0.4 vol % DIO exhibit the highest PCE of 3.55% with a fill factor of 56%, both of which are among the best performance for such a paradigm PTB7:PDI blend-based BHJ cells."

The rigid and coplanar main-chain backbone of the DTCC core provides a broad light-absorbing window and a higher-lying LUMO energy level, whereas the bulky flanked side chains reduce intermolecular interactions, making DTCCIC-C17 amorphous with excellent solution processability. The DTCCIC-C17 as an acceptor is combined with a medium band gap polymer poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1',3'-di-2-thienyl-5',7'-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1',2'-c:4',5'-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) as the donor in the active layer to obtain suitable highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy alignments and complimentary absorption. The devices with an inverted configuration (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag) without using an aqueous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate layer were fabricated for better device stability. When the diiodooctane-treated PBDB-T:DTCCIC-C17 active layer was thermally annealed at 50 °C for 10 min, the device achieved the highest efficiency of 9.48% with a high Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 14.27 mA cm-2, and an FF of 0.68."

Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.7b18152,"We synthesized three semicrystalline polymers (PTTBTBO, PDTBTBO, and P2FDTBTBO) by modulating the intra- and intermolecular noncovalent Coulombic interactions and investigated their photovoltaic characteristics under various light intensities. Low series (Rs) and high shunt (Rsh) resistances are essential prerequisites for good device properties under standard illumination (100 mW cm-2). Considering these factors, among three polymers, PDTBTBO polymer solar cells (PSCs) exhibited the most desirable characteristics, with peak power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 7.52 and 9.60% by being blended with PC71BM under standard and dim light (2.5 mW cm-2), respectively. P2FDTBTBO PSCs exhibited a low PCE of 3.69% under standard light due to significant charge recombination with high Rs (9.42 Ω cm2). However, the PCE was remarkably improved by 2.3 times (8.33% PCE) under dim light, showing negligible decrease in open-circuit voltage and remarkable increase in fill factor, which is due to an exceptionally high Rsh of over 1000 kΩ cm2. Rs is less significant under dim light because the generated current is too small to cause noticeable Rs-induced voltage losses. Instead, high Rsh becomes more important to avoid leakage currents.

Because of the strong intramolecular push-pull electron effect, the IDT-FBTR shows a strong and broad intramolecular charge-transfer absorption band in the range of 500-750 nm. Especially, as an electron-deficient FBT unit (A') and an electron-rich thiophene ring (D') in ""D-A combined π-bridge"" exert an ""offset effect"" to regulate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the molecule, a relatively high LUMO energy level can be maintained for IDT-FBTR that is helpful to enhance the open-circuit voltage ( Voc) for highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, the optimized OSC device based on IDT-FBTR as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor shows a much high Voc of 1.02 V with a relatively low Eloss of 0.56 eV and a best power conversion efficiency of 9.14%."

Mater. Interfaces,10.1021/acsami.8b04432,"We present here a series of wide-band-gap ( Eg: >1.8 eV) polymer donors by incorporating thiophene-flanked phenylene as an electron-donating unit and quinoxaline as an electron-accepting co-unit to attain large open-circuit voltages ( Vocs) and short-circuit currents ( Jscs) in nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Fluorination was utilized to fine-tailor the energetics of polymer frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) by replacing a variable number of H atoms on the phenylene moiety with F. It was found that fluorination can effectively modulate the polymer backbone planarity through intramolecular noncovalent S···F and/or H···F interactions. Polymers (P2-P4) show an improved molecular packing with a favorable face-on orientation compared to their nonfluorinated analogue (P1), which is critical to charge carrier transport and collection. When mixed with IDIC, a nonfullerene acceptor, P3 with two F atoms, achieves a remarkable Voc of 1.00 V and a large Jsc of 15.99 mA/cm2, simultaneously, yielding a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7%. Notably, the 1.00 V Voc is among the largest values in the IDIC-based OSCs, leading to a small energy loss ( Eloss: 0.62 eV) while maintaining a large PCE. The P3:IDIC blend shows an efficient exciton dissociation through hole transfer even under a small energy offset of 0.16 eV. Further fluorination leads to the polymer P4 with increased chain-twisting and mismatched FMO levels with IDIC, showing the lowest PCE of 2.93%. The results demonstrate that quinoxaline-based copolymers are promising donors for efficient OSCs and the fluorination needs to be fine-adjusted to optimize the interchain packing and physicochemical properties of polymers.

The IDT2BR materials mix fully with PC71BM materials, and the energy state of this phase can be tuned by varying the blending ratio. We performed photoluminescence and external quantum efficiency studies and found that the ternary charge cascade structure efficiently transfers the photogenerated charges from the polymer to IDT2BR and finally to PC71BM materials.

Although IT-M and ITIC have almost identical band gaps, the two optimized binary PSCs exhibit different photovoltaic parameters. The short current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of J71:IT-M based PSCs are larger than those of J71:ITIC based PSCs; the other key parameter, the fill factor (FF), is just the opposite.

Optimization of the photoactive layer nanomorphology yields a short-circuit current density value of 27.3 mA/cm2, one of the highest values in organic solar cells reported to date, which competes with other types of solution-processed solar cells such as perovskite or quantum dot devices. Along with decent open-circuit voltage (0.71 V) and fill factor values (66%), a power conversion efficiency of 12.8% is achieved for the champion devices. Morphology characterizations elucidate that the origin of this high photocurrent is mainly the increased π–π coherence length of the acceptor, the domain spacing, as well as the mean-square composition variation of the blend. Optoelectronic measurements confirm a balanced hole and electron mobility and reduced trap-assisted recombination for the best devices."

To the best of our knowledge, 78.9% FF is a new record for nonfullerene PSCs. Overall, our work provides a simple and effective molecule-designing method to promote FF of nonfullerene PSCs."

[ 11 ] The CN group-induced “twist elasticity” characteristics, which led to a large torsional or conformational change in response to molecular interactions, provided versatile formations of self-assembled nanostructures and, thus, enabled various optoelectronics applications. In particular, efforts toward obtaining good electron transporting materials successfully attained maximum organic fi eld-effect transistor electron mobilities of 2.14 cm 2 V –1 s –1 using (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(2,5bis(hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene)bis(2-(5-(4-(trifl uoromethyl)phenyl) thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile) (Hex-4-TFPTA, Figure 1 a). [ 11b ] Blend systems, such as coaxial nanocables, [ 11c ] stimuli-responsive mixed assemblies, [ 11d,e ] and donor–acceptor charge-transfer complexes, [ 11f,g ] in combination with other π -conjugated materials were also extensively investigated in an effort to capitalize on the electron-accepting and self-assembly characteristics of these compounds. However, their too strong self-assembly power that promoted the formation of mesoor microscale structures over exciton diffusion length scales [ 13 ] also limited their use for BHJ solar cell applications. Therefore, realizing balanced aggregation with effi cient charge transport in CN-substituted stilbenic structures remained challenging. This work focused on developing novel dicyanodistyrylbenzene-based non-fullerene acceptors with high electron affi nities and good solution processability. A specifi c method for modulating the self-assembly tendencies was implemented by incorporating a naphthalimide (NI) moiety into the terminal position of the molecules. The bulkiness of the NI substituent weakened the intermolecular interactions, so that the balanced aggregation characteristics could be induced. Indeed, aggregate formation in the spin-coated fi lm was dramatically suppressed, in contrast with the structures observed among other cyanostilbene thin fi lms. Furthermore, the outstanding electron-transporting properties of the NI unit [ 9,14 ] synergistically affected the electron acceptor properties, and the material solubilities were also notably increased by introducing branched alkyl chains at the N-position of the NI moiety. The photovoltaic properties of these molecules were investigated using regioregular poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor. The device performances could be tuned by applying a thermal annealing treatment, and optimized devices were obtained with a PCE of as high as 2.71%, which comes close to that of PC 61 BM acceptor devices. The three newly designed compounds, NIDCS, NIDCS-MO, and NIDCS-HO, are illustrated in Figure 1 a. The three compounds included different substituents on the core phenyl unit, hydrogen, methoxy, and hexyloxy. The compounds were synthesized using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction and were purifi ed by fl ash column chromatography and recrystallization (Supporting Information Scheme S1).

This work focused on developing novel dicyanodistyrylbenzene-based non-fullerene acceptors with high electron affi nities and good solution processability. A specifi c method for modulating the self-assembly tendencies was implemented by incorporating a naphthalimide (NI) moiety into the terminal position of the molecules.

Characterizing of the complex morphology at multiple length scales of polymer:nonfullerene small molecular acceptor (SMA) systems remains largely unexplored. Through detailed characterizations (hard/soft X‐ray scattering) of the record‐efficiency polymer:SMA system with a close analog, quantitative morphological parameters are related to the device performance parameters and fundamental morphology–performance relationships that explain why additive use and thermal annealing are needed for optimized performance are established. A linear correlation between the average purity variations at small length scale (≈10 nm) and photovoltaic device characteristics across all processing protocols is observed in ≈12%‐efficiency polymer:SMA systems. In addition, molecular interactions as reflected by the estimated Flory–Huggins interaction parameters are used to provide context of the room temperature morphology results.

Energy Mater.,10.1002/aenm.201602000,"Organic solar cells (OSCs) made of donor/acceptor bulk‐heterojunction active layers have been of widespread interest in converting sunlight to electricity. Characterizing of the complex morphology at multiple length scales of polymer:nonfullerene small molecular acceptor (SMA) systems remains largely unexplored. Through detailed characterizations (hard/soft X‐ray scattering) of the record‐efficiency polymer:SMA system with a close analog, quantitative morphological parameters are related to the device performance parameters and fundamental morphology–performance relationships that explain why additive use and thermal annealing are needed for optimized performance are established. A linear correlation between the average purity variations at small length scale (≈10 nm) and photovoltaic device characteristics across all processing protocols is observed in ≈12%‐efficiency polymer:SMA systems. In addition, molecular interactions as reflected by the estimated Flory–Huggins interaction parameters are used to provide context of the room temperature morphology results. Comparison with results from annealed devices suggests that the two SMA systems compared show upper and lower critical solution temperature behavior, respectively.

The solar cells are based on poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with varying molecular weights and a nonfullerene acceptor (rhodanine‐benzothiadiazole‐coupled indacenodithiophene, IDTBR) and are fabricated in air. P3HT:IDTBR solar cells light‐soaked over the course of 2000 h lose about 5% of power conversion efficiency (PCE), in stark contrast to [6,6]‐Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)‐based solar cells whose PCE shows a burn‐in that extends over several hundreds of hours and levels off at a loss of ≈34%. Replacing PCBM with IDTBR prevents short‐circuit current losses due to fullerene dimerization and inhibits disorder‐induced open‐circuit voltage losses, indicating a very robust device operation that is insensitive to defect states. Small losses in fill factor over time are proposed to originate from polymer or interface defects. Finally, the combination of enhanced efficiency and stability in P3HT:IDTBR increases the lifetime energy yield by more than a factor of 10 when compared with the same type of devices using a fullerene‐based acceptor instead."

In this study, it is demonstrated that random donor polymers based on thieno[2′,3′:5′,6′]pyrido[3,4‐g]thieno[3,2‐c]isoquinoline‐5,11(4H,10H)‐dione (TPTI) containing two simple thiophene (T) and bithiophene (2T) electron‐rich moieties (PTTI‐Tx) can be promising materials for the fabrication of highly efficient NF‐PSCs. With negligible influence on optical bandgaps and energy levels, the crystalline behavior of PTTI‐Tx polymers was modulated by varying the T:2T ratio in the polymer backbone; this resulted in the formation of different microstructures upon blending with a nonfullerene m‐ITIC acceptor in NF‐PSCs. In particular, a PTPTI‐T70:m‐ITIC system enabled favorable small‐scale phase separation with an increased population of face‐on oriented crystallites, thereby boosting the processes of effective exciton dissociation and charge transport in the device. Consequently, the highest power conversion efficiency of 11.02% with an enhanced short‐circuit current density of 17.12 mA cm−2 is achieved for the random polymer‐based NF‐PSCs thus far. These results indicate that random terpolymerization is a simple and practical approach for the optimization of a donor polymer toward highly efficient NF‐PSCs."

The study reveals that the donor polymer can significantly change the molecular ordering of the SMA and thus improve the electron mobility and domain purity of the blend, which has an overall positive effect that leads to the enhanced device FF for nonfullerene PSCs."

Although much of the progress is driven by the development of novel SMAs, the donor polymer also plays an important role in achieving efficient nonfullerene PSCs. However, it is far from clear how the polymer donor choice influences the morphology and performance of the SMAs and the nonfullerene blends. In addition, it is challenging to carry out quantitative analysis of the morphology of polymer:SMA blends, due to the low material contrast and overlapping scattering features of the π–π stacking between the two organic components. Here, a series of nonfullerene blends is studied based on ITIC‐Th blended with five different donor polymers.

The chemical, optical, and physical properties, device characteristics, and film morphology of 6TIC are intensively studied. 6TIC shows a narrow bandgap with band edge reaching 905 nm due to the electron‐rich π‐conjugated 6T core and reduced resonance stabilization energy. The rigid, π‐conjugated 6T also offers lower reorganization energy to facilitate very low VOC loss in the 6TIC system. The analysis of film morphology shows that PTB7‐Th and 6TIC can form crystalline domains and a bicontinuous network. These domains are enlarged when thermal annealing is applied. Consequently, the device based on PTB7‐Th:6TIC exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.07% with a high JSC > 20 mA cm−2 and a high VOC of 0.83 V with a relatively low VOC loss (≈0.55 V). Moreover, a semitransparent solar cell based on PTB7‐Th:6TIC exhibits a relatively high PCE (7.62%). The device can have combined high PCE and high JSC is quite rare for organic solar cells."

Energy Mater.,10.1002/aenm.201801209,"A series of narrow bandgap electron acceptors is designed and synthesized for efficient near‐infrared (NIR) organic solar cells. Extending π‐conjugation of donor frameworks leads to an intense intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in broad absorption profiles with band edge reaching 950 nm. When blended with an electron donor polymer PTB7‐Th, IOTIC‐2F exhibits efficient charge transfer even with a small energetic offset, so as to achieve a large photogenerated current over 22 mA cm−2 with small energy losses (≈0.49 eV) in solar cell devices. With an intense NIR absorbance, PTB7‐Th:IOTIC‐2F‐based cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 12.1% with good visible transparency (52% transmittance from 370 to 740 nm). Analysis of film morphology reveals that processing with solvent additives enhances crystalline features of acceptor components, while keeping an appropriate level of donor:acceptor intermixing in the binary blends. The incorporation of the third component, ITIC‐2F, into the PTB7‐Th:IOTIC‐2F blends increases the device efficiency up to 12.9%.

The materials, SF‐DPPs, have an X‐shaped geometry arising from four DPP units attached to a spirobifluorene (SF) center. The spiro‐dimer of DPP‐fluorene‐DPP is highly twisted, which suppresses strong intermolecular aggregation. Branched 2‐ethylhexyl (EH), linear n‐octyl (C8), and n‐dodecyl (C12) alkyl sides are chosen as substituents to functionalize the N,N‐positions of the DPP moiety to tune molecular interactions. SF‐DPPEH, the best candidate in SF‐DPPs family, when blended with poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) showed a moderate crystallinity and gives a Jsc of 6.96 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.10 V, a fill factor of 47.5%, and a power conversion efficiency of 3.63%. However, SF‐DPPC8 and SF‐DPPC12 exhibit lower crystallinity in their BHJ blends, which is responsible for their reduced Jsc. Coupling DPP units with SF using an acetylene bridge yields SF‐A‐DPP molecules. Such a small modification leads to drastically different morphological features and far inferior device performance. These observations demonstrate a solid structure–property relationship by topology control and material design.

The PSCs based on PTZ1:PMI‐F‐PMI (2:1, w/w) with the treatment of a mixed solvent additive of 0.5% N‐methyl pyrrolidone and 0.5% diphenyl ether demonstrate a very high open‐circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.3 V with a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6%. The high Voc of the PSCs is a result of the high‐lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of −3.42 eV of the PMI‐F‐PMI acceptor and the low‐lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −5.31 eV of the polymer donor. Very interestingly, the exciton dissociation efficiency in the active layer is quite high, even though the LUMO and HOMO energy differences between the donor and acceptor materials are as small as ≈0.08 and 0.19 eV, respectively. The PCE of 6% is the highest for the PSCs with a Voc as high as 1.3 V.

The wide absorption range makes the active blends absorb more photons, giving rise to a high short‐circuit current density, Jsc, value of 15.62 mA cm−2. The sulfur atom insertion also enhances the crystallinity of PBDTS–NQx and presents its blend film with a favorable nanophase separation, resulting in improved Jsc and fill factor (FF) values with a high power conversion efficiency of 11.47%. This work not only provides a new fused ring acceptor block (NQx) for constructing high‐performance wide bandgap copolymers but also provides the NQx‐based copolymers for achieving highly efficient nonfullerene PSCs."

Funct. Mater.,10.1002/adfm.201704389,"Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) in blends with highly crystalline donor polymers have been shown to yield particularly high device voltage outputs, but typically more modest quantum yields for photocurrent generation as well as often lower fill factors (FF). In this study, we employ transient optical and optoelectronic analysis to elucidate the factors determining device photocurrent and FF in blends of the highly crystalline donor polymer PffBT4T‐2OD with the promising NFA FBR or the more widely studied fullerene acceptor PC71BM. Geminate recombination losses, as measured by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, are observed to be significantly higher for PffBT4T‐2OD:FBR blends. This is assigned to the smaller LUMO‐LUMO offset of the PffBT4T‐2OD:FBR blends relative to PffBT4T‐2OD:PC71BM, resulting in the lower photocurrent generation efficiency obtained with FBR. Employing time delayed charge extraction measurements, these geminate recombination losses are observed to be field dependent, resulting in the lower FF observed with PffBT4T‐2OD:FBR devices. These data therefore provide a detailed understanding of the impact of acceptor design, and particularly acceptor energetics, on organic solar cell performance. Our study concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results for the design of NFAs in organic solar cells."

Funct. Mater.,10.1002/adfm.201705927,"Molecular engineering of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) plays a vital role in the development of organic photovoltaics. Oxygen as an electron donating atom is incorporated into the NFA system as alkoxyl forms at central, terminal, or central conjugated moieties due to the tunability at structural conformation, solubility, electron donating ability, absorption, energy levels, etc. In this work, a novel dipyran‐based ladder‐type building block (Ph‐DTDP), which possesses two oxygen atoms in the conjugated skeleton, is designed and facilely synthesized. It is applied as the donor core for the acceptor–donor–acceptor‐type NFA design and such functionalized‐O efficiently enhances the electron donating ability, lowers the band gap, redshifts and extends the absorption spectra. In addition, the π‐bridge effects are considered as well. Photovoltaic performances are systematically investigated and a high power conversion efficiency of 9.21% can be afforded with an energy loss of 0.57 eV. Meanwhile, the morphologies as well as the carrier mobilities of the blend films are studied to assist further understanding of the structure–property relationships.

Detailed investigations reveal that the extension of conjugation can affect the optical and electronic properties, molecular aggregation properties, charge separation in the bulk‐heterojunction films, and thus the overall photovoltaic performances. Single‐junction PSCs based on PTzBI:ITIC and PTzBI‐DT:ITIC exhibit remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.24% and 9.43%, respectively. To our knowledge, these PCEs are the highest efficiency values obtained based on electron‐donating conjugated polymers consisting of imide‐functionalized electron‐withdrawing building blocks. Of particular interest is that the resulting device based on PTzBI exhibits remarkable PCE of 7% with the thickness of active layer of 300 nm, which is among the highest values of nonfullerene PSCs utilizing thick photoactive layer.

Detailed investigations reveal that the extension of conjugation can affect the optical and electronic properties, molecular aggregation properties, charge separation in the bulk‐heterojunction films, and thus the overall photovoltaic performances. Single‐junction PSCs based on PTzBI:ITIC and PTzBI‐DT:ITIC exhibit remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.24% and 9.43%, respectively. To our knowledge, these PCEs are the highest efficiency values obtained based on electron‐donating conjugated polymers consisting of imide‐functionalized electron‐withdrawing building blocks. Of particular interest is that the resulting device based on PTzBI exhibits remarkable PCE of 7% with the thickness of active layer of 300 nm, which is among the highest values of nonfullerene PSCs utilizing thick photoactive layer.

When adopting a homotandem device architecture, the PCE is further improved to 13.35% (certified as 13.19%) with a much larger Voc of 2.13 V, which is the best value for any type of homotandem organic solar cells reported so far."

In addition to matched energy levels and complementary absorption spectrum with IDIC, PM6 possesses high crystallinity and strong π–π stacking alignment, which are favorable to charge carrier transport and hence suppress recombination in devices. As a result, the PM6:IDIC‐based PSCs without extra treatments show an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9%, which is the record value for the as‐cast PSC devices reported in the literature to date. Moreover, the device performances are insensitive to the active layer thickness (≈95–255 nm) and device area (0.20–0.81 cm2) with PCEs of over 11%. Besides, the PM6:IDIC‐based flexible PSCs with a large device area of 1.25 cm2 exhibit a high PCE of 6.54%. These results indicate that the PM6:IDIC blend is a promising candidate for future roll‐to‐roll mass manufacturing and practical application of highly efficient PSCs."

In this work, a new nonfullerene acceptor of DF‐PCIC is synthesized with an unfused‐ring core containing two cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) moieties and one 2,5‐difluorobenzene (DFB) group. A nearly planar geometry is realized through the F···H noncovalent interaction between CPDT and DFB for DF‐PCIC. After proper optimizations, the OSCs with DF‐PCIC as the acceptor and the polymer PBDB‐T as the donor yield the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.14% with a high fill factor of 0.72. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is among the highest values for the OSCs with nonfullerene acceptors owning unfused‐ring cores. Furthermore, no obvious morphological changes are observed for the thermally treated PBDB‐T:DF‐PCIC blended films, and the relevant devices can keep ≈70% of the original PCEs upon thermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h. This tolerance of such a high temperature for so long time is rarely reported for fullerene‐free OSCs, which might be due to the unique unfused‐ring core of DF‐PCIC. Therefore, the work provides new idea for the design of new nonfullerene acceptors applicable in commercial OSCs in the future."

Fullerenes as traditional electron acceptors have relatively weak visible absorption and limited electronic tunability, which constrains the optical and electronic properties required of the donor. Here, high‐performance fullerene‐free OSCs based on a combination of a medium‐bandgap polymer donor (FTAZ) and a narrow‐bandgap nonfullerene acceptor (IDIC), which exhibit complementary absorption, matched energy levels, and blend with pure phases on the exciton diffusion length scale, are reported. The single‐junction OSCs based on the FTAZ:IDIC blend exhibit power conversion efficiencies up to 12.5% with a certified value of 12.14%. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that exciting either the donor or the acceptor component efficiently generates mobile charges, which do not suffer from recombination to triplet states. Balancing photocurrent generation between the donor and nonfullerene acceptor removes undesirable constraints on the donor imposed by fullerene derivatives, opening a new avenue toward even higher efficiency for OSCs."

As a result, higher and more balanced hole and electron transport properties are observed. Active layers for OSCs comprising DMTPA‐PDI3 acceptor and PBT7‐Th donor exhibit suppressed intermolecular aggregation, giving rise to uniform nanophase network formation.

The binary device based on 3TT‐FIC and the polymer PTB7‐Th exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.21% with a high short circuit current density (   Jsc) of 25.89 mA cm−2. To fine‐tune the morphology and make full use of the visible region sunlight, phenyl‐C71‐butyricacid‐methyl ester (PC71BM) is used as the third component to fabricate ternary devices. In contrast to the binary devices, the ternary blend organic solar cells show significantly enhanced EQE ranging from 300 to 700 nm and thus an improved  Jsc with a high value of 27.73 mA cm−2. A high PCE with a value of 13.54% is achieved for the ternary devices, which is one of the highest efficiencies in single junction organic solar cells reported to date. The results provide valuable insight for the ternary devices in which the external quantum efficiency (EQE) induced by the third component is evidently observed and directly contributed to the enhancement of the device efficiency."

Herein, we use a D/A combination of PBDTTT-C-T (polymer donor) and a perylene diimide (PDI) dimer (small molecule acceptor) and find that the additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) effectively controls the surface D/A compositions. As pointed out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, the air surface of the active layer is donor-rich and the buried surface is acceptor-rich, while there is a homogeneous distribution of D/A composition across the active layer between the air and the buried surfaces. The donor abundance, i.e., D/A weight ratio, in the acceptor-rich buried surface plays a crucial role in tuning the injection property of selective carrie..."

In this paper, we report an approach of fine-tuning the parameters relative to the film-forming kinetics to increase the power conversion efficiency, which significantly improved from 1.4 up to 6.1%. The film-forming process was judiciously optimized by carefully manipulating the following four parameters: the additive content during film processing, the volume of the host solvent for solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the volume ratio of the additive versus the host solvent for SVA, and the time for SVA. Through such controls, the photocurrent dramatically increased from 5.40 to 12.83 mA/cm2 and the fill factor from 32.61 to 56.43% as a result of the reduction of the monomolecular and bimolecular loss and the improvement of the electron mobility.

Photoluminescence measurements reveal almost complete quenching of both the donor and acceptor excitons, indicating efficient electron and hole transfer processes. The nanomorphology of the films shows fine mixing of the donor polymer and TP at 50 : 50% weight ratio with a photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 45% in the visible regime. At the donor–acceptor interface, both polymer and TP excitons undergo fast dissociation with similar time scales of a few picoseconds. The magnitude of the polaron yield of PBDTTT-CT:TP blends is observed to be comparable to that of PBDTTT-CT:PC70BM blends and exhibits similar μs-decay dynamics. A power conversion efficiency of 3.2% is achieved for devices with 50 : 50% by weight compositional ratio of polymer and TP."

This molecule exhibits a low band gap (Eg = 1.52 eV), strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region and a high LUMO level (−3.79 eV). When a large band gap polymer J51 (Eg = 1.91 eV) was used as the donor, complementary absorption of the polymer donor and acceptor was obtained in the wavelength range of 350–850 nm. The solar cell based on J51:IDSe-T-IC gives a maximum PCE of 8.6%, with a high Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 62.0%. Moreover, this performance is much higher than that of J51:PC71BM based PSCs under similar device fabrication conditions (PCE = 6.0%). The trade-off features of the Jsc and Voc existing in PSCs with fullerene acceptors have been minimized in the fullerene-free PSCs based on IDSe-T-IC and J51. The results demonstrate that fine-tuning the absorption and electronic energy levels of non-fullerene acceptors, and properly selecting a polymer donor to achieve complementary absorption, is a promising way to further improve the performance of the PSCs."

Here, such a low-bandgap (1.43 eV) non-fullerene electron acceptor (BT-IC) bearing a fused 7-heterocyclic ring with absorption edge extending to the near-infrared (NIR) region was specially designed and synthesized. Benefitted from its NIR light harvesting, high performance OPVs were fabricated with medium bandgap polymers (J61 and J71) as donors, showing power conversion efficiencies of 9.6% with J61 and 10.5% with J71 along with extremely low energy loss (0.56 eV for J61 and 0.53 eV for J71).

Here, such a low-bandgap (1.43 eV) non-fullerene electron acceptor (BT-IC) bearing a fused 7-heterocyclic ring with absorption edge extending to the near-infrared (NIR) region was specially designed and synthesized. Benefitted from its NIR light harvesting, high performance OPVs were fabricated with medium bandgap polymers (J61 and J71) as donors, showing power conversion efficiencies of 9.6% with J61 and 10.5% with J71 along with extremely low energy loss (0.56 eV for J61 and 0.53 eV for J71).

Devices fabricated with Phenethyl-PDI and Hexyl-PDI have significantly lower performance. The thin film morphology and the electronic and photophysical properties of the three materials are examined, and although all three materials undergo efficient charge separation, PBTI3T:Phenyl-PDI is found to have the deepest LUMO, intermediate crystallinity, and the most well-mixed domains. This minimizes geminate recombination in Phenyl-PDI OPVs and affords the highest PCE. Thus, slip-stacked PDI strategies represent a promising approach to fullerene replacements in BHJ OPVs."

A straightforward synthesis route was employed, offering the potential for large scale preparation of this material. Inverted OPV devices employing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor polymer and FBR as the acceptor gave power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 4.1%. Transient and steady state optical spectroscopies indicated efficient, ultrafast charge generation and efficient photocurrent generation from both donor and acceptor. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate polaron generation efficiency as well as recombination dynamics. It was determined that the P3HT:FBR blend is highly intermixed, leading to increased charge generation relative to comparative devices with P3HT:PC60BM, but also faster recombination due to a nonideal morphology in which, in contrast to P3HT:PC60BM devices, the acceptor does not aggregate enough to create appropriate percolation pathways that prevent fast nongeminate recombination. Despite this nonoptimal morphology the P3HT:FBR devices exhibit better performance than P3HT:PC60BM devices, used as control, demonstrating that this acceptor shows great promise for further optimization."

However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have lagged far behind those of the polymer/fullerene system, mainly because of the low fill factor (FF) and photocurrent. Here we report a novel perylene bisimide (PBI) acceptor, SdiPBI-Se, in which selenium atoms were introduced into the perylene core. With a well-established wide-band-gap polymer (PDBT-T1) as the donor, a high efficiency of 8.4% with an unprecedented high FF of 70.2% is achieved for solution-processed non-fullerene organic solar cells. Efficient photon absorption, high and balanced charge carrier mobility, and ultrafast charge generation processes in PDBT-T1:SdiPBI-Se films account for the high photovoltaic performance.

Here we report a highly efficient non-fullerene organic solar cell with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.08 V and a small voltage loss of 0.55 V. The high performance was enabled by a novel wide-bandgap (2.05 eV) donor polymer paired with a narrow-bandgap (1.63 eV) small-molecular acceptor (SMA). Our morphology characterizations show that both the polymer and the SMA can maintain high crystallinity in the blend film, resulting in crystalline and small domains. As a result, our non-fullerene organic solar cells realize an efficiency of 11.6%, which is the best performance for a non-fullerene organic solar cell with such a small voltage loss."

We study charge recombination in an OPV blend comprising a polymer donor with a small molecule nonfullerene acceptor that exhibits both high photovoltaic internal quantum efficiency and relatively high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency. Notably, this donor/acceptor blend, consisting of the donor polymer commonly referred to as PCE10 with a pseudoplanar small molecule acceptor (referred to as FIDTT-2PDI) exhibits relatively bright delayed photoluminescence on the microsecond time scale beyond that observed in the neat material. We study the photoluminescence decay kinetics of the blend in detail and conclude that this long-lived photoluminescence arises from radiative nongeminate recombination of charge carriers, which we propose occurs via a donor/acceptor CT state located close in energy to the singlet state of the polymer donor. Additionally, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies point toward low subgap disorder, which could be beneficial for low radiative and nonradiative losses. These results provide an important demonstration of photoluminescence due to nongeminate charge recombination in an efficient OPV blend, a key step in identifying new OPV materials and materials-screening criteria if OPV is to approach the theoretical limits to efficiency."

However, thermal annealing results in a drastic decrease in both the efficiency and the electron current. Polarized soft X-ray spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray scattering reveal that thermal annealing results in a reorientation of the acceptor molecules to an edge-on orientation with their π–π stacking direction predominantly in-plane with the substrate and overall hexagonal packing among planar columnar structures. This packing motif greatly hinders vertical electron transport in bulk heterojunction films. Furthermore, in situ X-ray scattering studies show that this critical reorientation occurs even at relatively low temperatures (∼60 °C). These results are some of the first to highlight differences between the morphology of non-fullerene and fullerene-based bulk heterojunctions and critical parameters that must be controlled when designing future high-performance non-fullerene acceptor molecules."

Following these guidelines, a PCE of 3.7% is delivered by using the solution-processable, planar PDI monomer of N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide as the electron acceptor mixed with the low-energy gap polymeric donor poly[(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene))-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-CT). The PBDTTT-CT:PDI composite absorbs strongly the light in the region of 400 nm–800 nm and after adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) efficient photocurrent generation is achieved. Space-charge limited dark current and transient photovoltage measurements suggest that the use of the DIO component optimizes the electron/hole carrier mobility ratio, suppresses the non-geminate recombination losses and improves the charge extraction efficiency."

In all cases the PTB7-Th polymer is used as the electron donor. Among the three PTB7-Th:PDI systems, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) is obtained by the PDI4-based OSC device that exhibits a maximum PCE = 6.44% followed by the PDI2-based (PCE = 5.32%) and PDI1-based (PCE = 2.48%) devices. The detailed study of the photoluminescence quenching, morphology and temperature-dependent charge transport properties of the three systems reveal that the highest PCE of PTB7-Th:PDI4 is a consequence of the three-dimensional (3D) molecular architecture of PDI4 that tunes energetic disorder in the PDI phase and contributes to the improvement of electron transport.

Here, we investigate the fundamental causes of this decrease in the performance of solar cells using a non-fullerene acceptor (SF-PDI2) paired with two polymer donors, FTAZ and PyCNTAZ, compared with their fullerene-based counterparts. Through a number of experimental techniques and morphological studies, we show that the SF-PDI2-based solar cells suffer from insufficient charge generation, transport, and collection when compared with the PCBM-based solar cells. The SF-PDI2-based solar cells show increased bimolecular recombination, which, together with other recombination loss mechanisms in these cells, causes a significant decrease in their Jsc and FF. Notably, the less pure domains, low electron mobility (on the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and imbalanced mobility (in regard to the hole mobility) further explain the low FF. On the other hand, the higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the SF-PDI2 devices is mainly due to the increase in the CT state energy. It is worth mentioning that the PyCNTAZ-based devices show an ultralow charge separation energy (ΔECS), close to 0 eV.

However, an n-type DTCC-based organic semiconductor has not been reported to date. In this study, the first DTCC-based n-type organic semiconductor (DTCC–IC) with a well-defined A–D–A backbone was designed, synthesized, and characterized, in which a DTCC derivative substituted by four p-octyloxyphenyl groups was used as the electron-donating core and two strongly electron-withdrawing 3-(dicyanomethylene)indan-1-one moieties were used as the terminal acceptors. It was found that DTCC–IC has strong light-capturing ability in the range of 500–720 nm and exhibits an impressively high molar absorption coefficient of 2.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 669 nm owing to effective intramolecular charge transfer and a strong D–A effect. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTCC–IC are −5.50 and −3.87 eV, respectively. More importantly, a high electron mobility of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was determined by the space-charge-limited current method; this electron mobility can be comparable to that of fullerene derivative acceptors (μe ∼ 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). To investigate its application potential in non-fullerene solar cells, we fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) by blending a DTCC–IC acceptor with a PTB7-Th donor under various conditions. The results suggest that the optimized device exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6% and a rational high VOC of 0.95 V. These findings demonstrate that the ladder-type DTCC core is a promising building block for the development of high-mobility n-type organic semiconductors for OSCs."

Compared to the analogous polymer J61 with linear dodecylthio side chains in the BDTT unit and a long 2-hexyldecyl side chain in BTz-2F, PSBZ possesses branched 2-butyloctyl side chains to increase steric hindrance of the BDTT unit and a short 2-butyloctyl side chain to decrease steric hindrance of the BTz-2F unit for more efficient charge separation and transport in the devices. As a result, PSBZ exhibited stronger π–π interaction and smaller stacking spacing leading to a higher extinction coefficient of 1.48 × 105 cm−1 and a high hole mobility of 8.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to the analogous polymer J61 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.53% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.43 mA cm−2, the PSBZ:ITIC-based polymer solar cells yielded a higher PCE of 10.5% with a higher Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2.

PM6 possesses a strong absorption in the short wavelength region of 300–685 nm with a large bandgap of 1.80 eV, which is complementary to that of ITIC (1.55 eV) and facilitates achieving high short-circuit current (Jsc) in PSCs. Moreover, PM6 shows a deep HOMO level of −5.50 eV, a strong crystallinity and a dominant face on packing, which helps to achieve a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) in PSCs. As a result, the PM6:ITIC-based PSCs obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% with a Voc of up to 1.04 V, a Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58%, under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2.

We found that, similar to fullerene-based devices, fluorination leads to an increased open circuit voltage (Voc) from the lowered HOMO level and improved fill factor (FF) from the higher charge carrier mobility. More importantly, donor polymer fluorination in this NFA-based system also led to a large increase in short circuit current (Jsc), which stems from the improved charge transport and extraction in the fluorinated device.

The nonfullerene BHJ devices with the SM acceptor D5T6F-M achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to ca. 4.5% (vs. ca. 2% for D7T8F-M-based devices). Our study shows that –F substitutions in SM systems – otherwise used as donors – is an effective approach in the design of nonfullerene acceptors for efficient BHJ solar cells with polymer donors."

If the processing solvent is changed from chlorobenzene to chloroform, a further improved PCE of 11.49% is obtained for HF–PCIC-based PSCs due to the formation of finer phase separation domains.

In this report, we investigate the role of molecular conformation of perylene diimide (PDI) dimers designed to act as non-fullerene acceptors in organic solar cells. A series of three PDI dimers is presented in which the PDI chromophores are directly linked via the bay position (PDI2, 3) or separated by one (PDI2Ac, 4) or two (PDI2Ac2, 5) acetylene spacers. In all cases, the exo-position of the PDI dimers is N-annulated. New compounds 4 and 5 were synthesized via an optimized and facile synthetic pathway. Directly linked PDI dimers adopted a highly twisted conformation whereas adding two acetylene spacers rendered the PDI chromophores coplanar. 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of each dimer revealed a highly sensitive electronic structure that is strongly influenced by the acetylene spacers. It was found that compounds 4 and 5 with less twisted structures exhibited similar electron affinities but lower ionization potentials, lower organic solvent solubility, and red-shifted optical absorption spectra when compared to the highly twisted dimer 3. In addition, 4 and 5 showed a stronger tendency to aggregate in both solution and the solid state.

The propeller-shaped conformation could prevent the acceptor molecules from forming large aggregates in the active layer. As expected, the PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 blend films show a favorable morphology as well as high and balanced charge carrier mobility. Devices based on PTB7-Th:HPB-PDI6 achieved a PCE of 6.63% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2, and an FF of 48.0%. Our results have demonstrated that the easily prepared propeller-shaped HPB-PDI6 could be a promising acceptor for high efficiency organic solar cells."

Mater. Chem. C,10.1039/c8tc03303j,"Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have great potential to replace the commonly used fullerene derivatives in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, PDI-based molecules have a strong tendency to aggregate in thin films, which prevents the formation of appropriate phase separation. To alleviate this problem, much effort has been devoted to developing twisted PDI dimers with functional bridges at bay positions. Unfortunately, the bay-functionalized PDI dimers exhibit relatively low electron mobilities due to the excessive twist geometry. To solve this dilemma, an efficient method is to functionalize the PDI at less sterically-encumbered ortho-positions. In this article, we synthesized two novel ortho-functionalized PDI dimers, namely PDI-2Th-PDI and PDI-ThFTh-PDI, and investigated the influence of the conjugated bridge length on the physical and photovoltaic properties of PDIs. After introducing a fluorene bridge between the thiophene units, PDI-ThFTh-PDI with the extended conjugate length possessed a relatively low-crystalline nature and therefore exhibited one order of magnitude lower electron mobility compared to PDI-2Th-PDI. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells fabricated with PDI-2Th-PDI as the electron acceptor and PTB7-Th as the electron donor is almost twice that of the solar cell with PDI-ThFTh-PDI as the acceptor. Our findings provide important guidelines for the design of more efficient ortho-functionalized PDI acceptors."

This study introduces the third component, nonfullerene acceptor IEICO, into binary PSC-based PBDTBDD:PC71 BM to fabricate ternary PSC with one donor and two acceptors. By carefully tuning the third component ratio and cathode engineering, the resulting ternary PSC shows a power conversion efficiency of 10.51%, greatly improved in comparison with binary PSCs-based PBDTBDD:PC71 BM (7.86%) and PBDTBDD:IEICO (5.19%). In addition to extended light absorption, the third component IEICO could accelerate charge-carrier transfer, decrease charge recombination, and increase electron collection, resulting from cascade energy levels, and ameliorate the device morphology to increase the contact area of the active layer and cathode buffer layer. This work demonstrates that ternary PSC incorporated with IEICO is a promising structure for producing high performance PSCs."

However, the development of D-s-A copolymers significantly falls behind the alternative D-A copolymers, especially for organic solar cells, because a breakthrough in device performance is not yet obtained with a reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2%-4%. Herein, a newly developed D-s-A copolymer PDRCNBDT, bearing 2-(1, 1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine pendant group as the donor material, delivers a high PCE of 5.3% for nonfullerene solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best value reported for D-s-A copolymers to date. The improved PCE is observed to be associated with a very small energy loss (Eloss ) of 0.57 eV, accompanied by a high open-circuit voltage (Voc ) of 1.015 eV. It is important to note that this efficient D-s-A copolymer is employed in organic solar cells (OSCs), free of additive and annealing treatments."

Chem.,10.1039/c7nj01971h,"Perylenediimide (PDI) possesses intense absorption, a low-lying energy level, and a high electron mobility. However, its highly planar conformation and thus strong intermolecular π–π stacking prevents its application as an electron acceptor used in efficient bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we report a structurally non-planar molecule TRIP-PDI3, in which a rigid and shape-persistent triptycene (TRIP) unit is employed as a central unit to collect three PDI arms at the periphery. As an electron acceptor, TRIP-PDI3 exhibits a low-lying LUMO energy level of −3.81 eV similar to that of conventional PCBM, but with an intensive light absorption in the range of 450–600 nm. BHJ OSCs were fabricated using TRIP-PDI as an electron acceptor and a low band gap polymer PBDT-TS1 as an electron donor, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.53%. The result demonstrates that TRIP is a promising building block for the construction of structurally non-planar PDI derivatives as non-fullerene (NF) electron acceptors for efficient OSCs."

Different end capped groups, 1,2,3-trifluorobenzene and fused-ring moieties (benzo[b]thiophene and benzo[b]furan), were separately introduced into promising DPP-based nonfullerenes SF-DPP-EH, and three new spiro-DPPs SF-(DPP3F)4, SF-(DPPBT)4 and SF-(DPPBF)4) were obtained. These terminal groups largely extend the conjugation in SF-DPP-EH with an obvious red-shifted absorption (25–43 nm).

ITIC has been widely reported in non-fullerene solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10%, when it is combined with a wide band gap conjugated polymer, while its application in small band gap DPP polymers has never been reported. Herein, we select four DPP polymers containing different thienyl linkers, resulting in distinct absorption spectra, energy levels and crystalline properties. Non-fullerene solar cells based on DPP polymers as donors and ITIC as an acceptor show PCEs of 1.9-4.1% and energy loss of 0.55-0.82 eV. The PCEs are much lower than those of cells based on fullerene derivatives due to the poor miscibility between the DPP polymers and ITIC, as confirmed by the morphology and charge transport investigation. The results indicate that it is important to tune the miscibility between the donor and acceptor in order to realize optimized micro-phase separation, which can further enhance the performance of DPP polymer based non-fullerene solar cells."

The subtle structural differences between BDT-O and BDT-T lead to distinct aggregation abilities: with respect to the over-strong aggregation ability of the BDT-O bridged dimer 2, the BDT-T bridged dimer 1 shows largely reduced aggregation ability and is solution-processable in the commonly used organic solvent. The highly twisted conformation between the PDI–BDT–PDI planes produced steric-pairing effects, which directed ordered packing of dimer 1. When dimer 1 was blended with P3HT in a weight D/A ratio of 1 : 2.5, the electron mobility (μe) was 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the best PCE was 1.72%. Slowing the solvent evaporation speed benefited the packing order of the PDI dimer, and the μe value was slightly increased to 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The best PCE was improved up to 1.87%. The μe was further increased up to 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the D/A ratio was decreased down to 1 : 2.2 and the best PCE of 1.95% was achieved. Solid absorption spectra and XRD data of the blended films supported the improvement of the packing order of the PDI dimer by slowing the solvent annealing speed. AFM images supported the largely reduced aggregation ability of dimer 1 when blended with P3HT. The observed phase size of 35 nm is formed under the slow solvent annealing speed and a D/A ratio of 1 : 2.2. Our results revealed that the amphiphilic nature of the bridged aromatic unit reduces the aggregation ability and facilitates the ordered packing of the PDI units, contributing to the improvement of efficiency."

However, no research disclosing the influence of molecular weight (Mn ) of conjugated polymer on the nonfullerene device performance is reported. In this work, a series of polymers with different Mn s are synthesized to systematically investigate the connection between Mn and performance of nonfullerene devices for the first time. It is found that the device performance improves substantially as the Mn increases from 12 to 38 kDa and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 10.5% is realized. It has to be noted this PCE is achieved without using any additives and post-treatments, which is among the top efficiencies of additive- and post-treatment-free PSCs.

Herein, three trialkylsilyl substituted benzodithiophene-based polymer donors (PJ1, PJ2, and PJ3) were synthesized with fine-tuning of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and optical absorption. Using the polymer series paired with absorption-complementary small molecular acceptors (SMAs), namely, m-ITIC, IDIC, and AIDIC, we systematically studied the performance of a 3 × 3 matrix of NF-PSCs. An increasing open-circuit voltage with deepening HOMOs of the polymer donors, and the enhanced short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) were ascribed to the well-intermixed blend morphology containing enhanced SMA order ranges with mixed face-on and edge-on orientations, the so-called 3-D texture. Such an optimal microstructure is best exemplified in the PJ2:IDIC combination, affording a highest efficiency of 12.01% with a simultaneously high JSC of 17.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.3%. The devices with an active layer thickness of 300 nm still maintain an impressive efficiency approaching 10% with a decent FF of 60.0%. Moreover, the Channel II process, i.e., photoinduced hole transfer through acceptor excitation, was demonstrated to be crucially important for photocurrent generation.
