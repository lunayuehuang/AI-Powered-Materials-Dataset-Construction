2,2,10.1016/j.cej.2021.130097,,,Weakening conformational locking for fine tuning of morphology and photovoltaic performance by introducing a third component,2021,"Abstract Herein, a new polymer o-PBTA-PSF (P1) is synthesized with a donor unit 4,8-bis(2-fluoro-4-((2-hexyldecyl)thio)phenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene containing the fluorine atoms (named o-BDTPSF) and an acceptor unit 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)–2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole. However, a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.46% is obtained for P1:ITIC-based devices. The poor performance ascribes to the strong aggregation originating from the conformational locking in the polymer backbone. Hence, we employ the random ternary polymerization strategy to synthesize a series of donor polymers to weaken the conformational locking and achieve excellent photovoltaic performance. The terpolymer P4 obtains the optimal PCE of 13.26% with an incorporation of 30% BDTPS, a similar structure of o-BDTPSF, into the P1 polymer backbone. This significant improvement benefits from the enhanced JSC and FF, resulting from the appropriate aggregation and better phase separation in the active layer. These results indicate that the photovoltaic performance could be improved through the strategy of random copolymerization and conformational control."

We used UV–Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering to investigate the optoelectronic and morphological properties of the resulting ternary blend films. We evaluated the carrier transport properties of these OPVs to identify the mechanism governing their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Of our two tested polymers, FTAZ had more suitable energy levels and miscibility; therefore, its presence increased the open-circuit voltage of the resulting ternary device. The embedded FTAZ facilitated the molecular packing of Y6 and improved the charge transport in the ternary blend, thereby improving the PCE of the device from 14.3% (binary) to 15.3% (ternary)."
5,5,10.1016/j.orgel.2021.106235,,,Effects of functionalization of Y6 end-groups with electron-withdrawing groups on the photovoltaic properties at the donor-acceptor interfaces of PM6/Y6 OSCs: A theoretical insight,2021,"Abstract Since the high performance non-fullerene acceptor Y6 appears, many organic solar cells (OSCs) based on it and its derivatives have been fabricated and studied. These OSCs show delicate changes of open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) with respect to prototype PM6/Y6 OSC. So far, the effects of functionalization of Y6 end-groups with electron-withdrawing groups on the photovoltaic properties at the donor-acceptor interfaces of PM6/Y6 OSC are still not well understood. In the present work, by modelling four OSCs based on symmetrical (Y6, Y6-4Cl, and Y6-4CN) and asymmetrical (Y6-2Cl) molecules, we find that for symmetrical Y6 and Y6-4Cl based OSCs, the computed VOCs and FFs obtained with reliable computational method show the same trend as experimental data, but the computational method used does not apply for asymmetrical Y6-2Cl based OSC. In addition, with respect to fluorination, chlorination generally would bring stronger simulated interfacial absorption spectrum, the smaller exciton binding energy of local excited state of monomers and charge transfer state at the interface, smaller singlet−triplet energy gap, the higher total oscillator strength of all CT states, and larger interfacial electrostatic potential difference. In contrast, PM6/Y6-4CN has relative much lower total oscillator strength of all CT states and predicted VOC and FF than prototype Y6/PM6 though the end-groups with CN substitutions have much stronger electron withdrawing ability. Our results gain insights into the donor-acceptor interfacial properties of OSCs based on Y6 and its derivatives."
6,6,10.1002/adma.202101295,,,Narrow-Bandgap Single-Component Polymer Solar Cells with Approaching 9% Efficiency,2021,"Two narrow-bandgap block conjugated polymers with a (D1-A1)-(D2-A2) backbone architecture, namely PBDB-T-b-PIDIC2T and PBDB-T-b-PTY6, are designed and synthesized for single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Both polymers contain same donor polymer, PBDB-T, but different polymerized nonfullerene molecule acceptors. Compared to all previously reported materials for SCOSCs, PBDB-T-b-PIDIC2T and PBDB-T-b-PTY6 exhibit narrower bandgap for better light harvesting. When incorporated into SCOSCs, the short-circuit current density (Jsc ) is significantly improved to over 15 mA cm-2 , together with a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit low energy loss due to high charge transfer (CT) states (Ect ) plus small non-radiative loss (0.26 eV), and improved stability under both ambient condition and continuous 80 °C thermal stresses for over 1000 h. Determination of the charge carrier dynamics and film morphology in these SCOSCs reveals increased carrier recombination, relative to binary bulk-heterojunction devices, which is mainly due to reduced ordering of both donor and acceptor fragments. The close structural relationship between block polymers and their binary counterparts also provides an excellent framework to explore further molecular features that impact the photovoltaic performance and boost the state-of-the-art efficiency of SCOSCs."
11,11,10.1007/s11664-021-09020-5,,,Optimization of Nanoparticle Organic Photovoltaic Device Performance using SCAPS Software,2021,"The fabrication of nanoparticle (NP) organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells has attracted great interest due to the possibility of controlling the morphology of the active layer and eliminating harmful solvents. However, NP OPV devices exhibit low efficiency compared with bulk heterojunction devices. The solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) simulation package using a framework based on a one-dimensional drift–diffusion model is applied in the current work to improve the efficiency of NP OPV devices with a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) active layer. The optimization results confirm that the best thickness for the active layer is 100 nm to 120 nm and that the device reaches its highest performance in this thickness range but low efficiency for thicknesses above 120 nm. Changing the electron mobility (in the range of 1 × 10−3 cm2/V-s < µe < 1 × 10−4 cm2/V-s) is found to have no impact on the device efficiency, whereas the device performance is improved by 27% when the hole mobility is varied in this range (1 × 10−3 cm2/V-s < µh < 1 × 10−4 cm2/V-s). Additionally, the donor and acceptor density (ND and NA) are optimized, revealing that the best values of 1 × 1015 cm−3 and 1 × 1018 cm3, respectively, lead to an improvement in the device efficiency by about 60%. The current findings indicate that the performance of NP OPV devices can indeed be enhanced by optimizing the morphology of the active layer."
12,12,10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.166787,,,DFT molecular modeling studies of D-π-A-π-D type cyclopentadithiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole based small molecules donor materials for organic photovoltaic cells,2021,"Abstract A novel six D-π-A-π-D type compounds containing small molecules from cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole building (DPP) units were designed, as donors, for improving the efficiency of bulk hetero-junction solar cells. The geometries of the title compounds were optimized using the density functional theory at the hybrid functional B3LYP in combination with the 6−311 g(d,p) basis set. Electronic structures, photo-physical, optical and intra-molecular charge transfer properties have been investigated. The contour plots of the transition density matrix have been simulated for all compounds and used to evaluate the hole-electron localization, the donor-acceptor interaction as well as the electronic excitation processes in their excited states. The new designed donors have shown a large absorption in the visible range with interesting hole transport properties, resulted from their rigid-planar structures. The open circuit voltage and the fill factor were estimated. The present computational study showed that tuning the building blocks of the organic materials dispose a potential approach for further enhance the performance of small molecules donor materials in bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) organic solar cells."
13,13,10.1088/1742-6596/1963/1/012012,,,DFT/TD-DFT Study of Donorπ-Acceptor Organic Dye models contained Triarylamine for an Efficient Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell,2021,"A systematic theoretical study was performed for dipolar triarylamine-based Dπ-A dyes. These dyes are composed of good required features to be active for enhancing the efficiency of solar cell such as arylamine donor moieties, and an acceptor part with cyanoacetic acid, while the conjugation process is adopted by the fluorene or biphenyl linkers. The required properties both electronic and opticals were computed with DFT/TDDFT levels and 6-31G (d, p) basis set, then show the response of the efficiency. The obtained results have predicted the excitation energies, HOMO-LUMO energy levels which indicate an improvement in the two principle processes; electron injection and the regeneration of dyes. Also, the important factors in close connection with the short-circuit current density (Jsc), such as light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), total reorganization energy (λtotal) and injection driving force (ΔGinject) have been explained. As a result, the calculated data verify that the D dye can represent a potential sensitizer for solar cells, this can be rationalized by its reasonable photovoltaic parameters with other electronic and optical properties."
17,17,10.1016/j.dyepig.2021.109387,,,Molecular packing modulation enabling optimized blend morphology and efficient all small molecule organic solar cells,2021,"Abstract The molecular planarity of a small molecule donor is one of the key factors affecting its molecular packing behavior, the morphology of the related active blend and thus the photovoltaic properties of all small molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs). In this contribution, a series of new benzodithiophene (BDT)-based A-π-D-π-A type small molecules were developed, namely SD1, SD2 and SD3, by combining the chemical modification of side chain (sulfuration), π-bridge (alkoxy groups introducing) and end group (different type or different alkyl chain). The sulfuration of the BDT side chains and introducing alkoxy group to the π-bridge could induce intermolecular S⋯S and intramolecular S⋯O non-covalent interactions for higher planarity of these small molecules. The rhodanine and cyanoacetate end groups showed less effect on the optical and electronic properties but significantly affected the molecular packing behavior and blend morphology. From SD1:Y6-T to SD2:Y6-T and SD3:Y6-T, the face-to-face packing was gradually reduced, while the face-to-edge packing was increased, which resulted in lowered exciton dissociation efficiency, further decreased the device performance. SD1:Y6-T blend exhibited more favorable face-to-face packing and ideal morphology for efficient charge dissociation and transport, contributing to a champion PCE of 10.12%. This work provided a deep insight of the donor and acceptor packing behavior effect on the photovoltaic property by molecular design."
18,18,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105957,,,Overcoming incompatibility of donors and acceptors by constructing planar heterojunction organic solar cells,2021,"Abstract Nanoscale phase separation plays a critical role in achieving high photovoltaic performance in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells, which is limited by solubility, crystallinity, and the compatibility of the donors and acceptors. However, these limits can be overcome by new applications of the traditional planar heterojunction structure. Herein, we demonstrate quasi-orthogonal solvents for a wide-band-gap donor (P2F-EHp) and a highly crystalline non-fullerene acceptor (M4–4F) to overcome the over-agglomeration and enabled the fabrication of a planar heterojunction device with a favorable power conversion efficiency of 14.2% (compared with 12.7% in bulk-heterojunction device), which is among one of the highest efficiencies of planar heterojunction devices to date. Detailed studies based on cross-sectional transmittance electron microscopy, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering at various incident angles, and resonance soft X-ray scattering measurements confirmed the formation of optimal nanoscale morphology. Further transient absorption measurements also proved that the exciton dissociation and free-carrier generation efficiency are not limited by the small mixed-phase area and large pure domains. These findings show insights into the intrinsic morphological changes and charge transfer process in bulk-heterojunction and planar heterojunction structures, providing a novel method for matching donors and acceptors with relatively poor compatibility."
19,19,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105963,,,Synergistically minimized nonradiative energy loss and optimized morphology achieved via the incorporation of small molecule donor in 17.7% efficiency ternary polymer solar cells,2021,"Abstract To further improve the photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells (PSCs), it is an essential and significantly challenging issue to synergistically minimize non-radiative energy loss and optimize morphology. In this work, ternary PSCs are fabricated by incorporating a small molecule donor, namely BTTzR, into the state-of-the-art PM6:Y6 binary system. Detailed investigations suggest that BTTzR can form energy cascade with binary components to facilitate charge transfer. Furthermore, the integration of BTTzR can enhance crystallization and domain purity of the binary blend, and effectively suppress the aggregation of Y6, which ultimately leads to more efficient charge transport and lower non-radiative energy loss (ΔEnr). As a result, compared to the binary devices with PCE of 15.8% and ΔEnr of 0.23 eV, the ternary PSCs with 20% BTTzR contents achieved a significantly enhanced performance with PCE of 17.7% and lower ΔEnr of 0.19 eV, which are among the best results reported in the literatures to date. Therefore, this work not only offers a high-efficiency ternary blend system but also provides an efficient strategy to synergistically minimize non-radiative energy loss and optimize the morphology for the development of PSCs."
20,20,10.1021/acsami.1c05921,,,All-Polymer Solar Cells Approaching 12% Efficiency with a New π-Conjugated Polymer Donor Enabled by a Nonhalogenated Solvent Process,2021,"High efficiency and nonhalogenated solvent processing are important issues for commercial application of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). In this regard, we increased the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs to a benchmark power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.66% by manipulating the pre-aggregation of a new π-conjugated polymer donor (Nap-SiBTz) using toluene as a solvent. This use of Nap-SiBTz enhanced the absorption coefficient (λmax = 9.30 × 104 cm-1), increased charge carrier mobility, suppressed trap-assisted recombination, improved bulk heterojunction morphology, and resulted in high PCEs of all-PSCs with an active layer thickness of 200 nm. To overcome severe charge recombination and energy losses, a 1-phenylnapthalene additive was used to achieve a well-ordered microstructure and molecular packing that inherently improved the device performances. The resulting encapsulation-free devices exhibited good ambient and thermal stabilities. The results of this study augur well for the future of the roll-to-roll production of all-PSCs."
21,21,10.1039/d1tc01290h,,,BODIPY-modified terpolymer donors for efficient fullerene- And nonfullerene-polymer solar cells,2021,"Developing efficient polymer donor materials to well-match with acceptors affords continuous contributions to the eminent progress of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a new series of terpolymer donors is developed by embedding electron-deficient boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as the third monomer into the backbone of the benchmark copolymer PTB7-Th. Terpolymers afford less-rigid planarity, ascensive light-harvest ability, down-shifted HOMO levels and modified aggregation properties. Compared with copolymer PTB7-Th, synchronously improved photovoltaic performance is realized by employing terpolymers as electron donors both for fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors, with the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhanced from 8.78% to 9.52% for PC71BM- and from 8.79% to 10.05% for IEICO-4F-based devices, respectively. Interestingly, it is found that in terpolymer:fullerene blends, favorable light-harvesting contributes to boosted PCE. Additionally, for PSCs based on nonfullerene acceptors, improved photovoltaic performance is mainly ascribed to the modified morphology by a terpolymer approach. Our results not only confirm the advantages of BODIPY units in constructing efficient terpolymers, but also illuminate the unique virtues of the terpolymer strategy in synergistical optimization of the photovoltaic parameters to contribute to both efficient fullerene- and nonfullerene-PSCs."
22,22,10.1021/acsami.1c02442,,,A Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor Composed of Benzodithiophene and Oxime-Substituted Thiophene for High-Performance Organic Solar Cells,2021,"Oxime-substituted thiophene (TO) is used as an acceptor (A) unit to copolymerize with the benzodithiophene (BDT) donor (D) unit to form a novel D-A polymer donor, PBDTTO, which has a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) of -5.60 eV and a wide bandgap of 2.03 eV, forming complementary absorption and matching energy levels with the narrow bandgap nonfullerene acceptors. Organic solar cells using PBDTTO and Y6 as the donor and acceptor, respectively, exhibited a JSC of 27.03 mA cm-2, a VOC of 0.83 V, and a fill factor of 0.59, reaching a high power conversion efficiency of 13.29%. The unencapsulated devices show good long-term stability in ambient air. Compared with the acceptor monomers used in other high-performance BDT-based D-A polymer donors, which are synthesized tediously in low yields, the TO acceptor monomer can be conveniently synthesized in only two steps with a high overall yield of 70%. These results demonstrate that TO unit can be used as a promising acceptor unit for developing BDT-based D-A polymer donors at low cost while maintaining high photovoltaic performance."
23,23,10.1126/sciadv.abf7672,,,"Revealing generation, migration, and dissociation of electron-hole pairs and current emergence in an organic photovoltaic cell",2021,"Photoexcitation, electron-hole pair migration, charge separation, and current generation are simulated quantum mechanically. Using an innovative quantum mechanical method for an open quantum system, we observe in real time and space the generation, migration, and dissociation of electron-hole pairs, transport of electrons and holes, and current emergence in an organic photovoltaic cell. Ehrenfest dynamics is used to study photoexcitation of thiophene:fullerene stacks coupled with a time-dependent density functional tight-binding method. Our results display the generation of an electron-hole pair in the donor and its subsequent migration to the donor-acceptor interface. At the interface, electrons transfer from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of thiophenes to the second LUMOs of fullerene. Further migration of electrons and holes leads to the emergence of current. These findings support previous experimental evidence of coherent couplings between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom and are expected to stimulate further work toward exploring the interplay between electron-hole pair (exciton) binding and vibronic coupling for charge separation and transport."
24,24,10.1515/zpch-2019-1523,,,The theoretical investigation of the opto-electronic properties of designed molecules having 2-(2-Methylene-3-oxo-indane-1-ylidene)malononitrile as end-capped acceptors,2021,"Abstract Five acceptor-donor-acceptor molecules having different core units with 2-(2-Methylene-3-oxo-indane-1-ylidene)malononitrile as end capped terminal acceptor unit were designed. The ground state geometries and electronic properties were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) at MPW1PW91/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The absorption spectra were computed by using time dependent DFT at MPW1PW91/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The designed molecules have broad absorption range in visible region. M3 shows relatively lower band gap so that having high light harvesting efficiency (LHE). The molecules consider as better hole blocking materials in term of high ionization potentials. The reorganization energies calculation of M1, M2 and M4 manifests that these molecules are the optimal candidate for electron transportation. High value of Voc has been observed for molecules which would favorably contribute in power conversion efficiency. M1, M2, M4 and M5 are more stable in terms of absolute hardness and electrostatic potential surfaces. All molecules show good opto-electronic properties in the aspect of their use in photovoltaic application."
25,25,10.1007/s11426-021-9988-6,,,Non-equivalent D-A copolymerization strategy towards highly efficient polymer donor for polymer solar cells,2021,"D-A copolymerization is a broadly utilized molecular design strategy to construct high efficiency photovoltaic materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs), and all the D-A copolymer donors reported till now are the alternate D-A copolymers with equal D- and A-units. Here, we first propose a non-equivalent D-A copolymerization strategy with unequal D- and A-units, and develop three novel non-equivalent D-A copolymer donors (PM6-D1, PM6-D2 and PM6-D3 with D/A unit ratio of 1.1:0.9, 1.2:0.8 and 1.3:0.7, respectively) by inserting more D units into the alternate D-A copolymer PM6 backbone to finely tune the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. The three non-equivalent D-A copolymers show the down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, higher hole mobility, higher degree of molecular self-assembly and higher molecular crystallinity with the increase of D-unit ratio in comparison with the alternate D-A copolymer PM6. As a result, all the three non-equivalent D-A copolymer-based PSCs with Y6 as acceptor achieve improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) with higher Voc, larger Jsc and higher FF simultaneously. Particularly, the PM6-D1:Y6 based PSC achieved a high PCE of 17.71%, which is significantly higher than that (15.82%) of the PM6:Y6 based PSC and is one of the highest performances in the binary PSCs."
26,26,10.3390/polym13111770,,,Comparing donor- and acceptor-originated exciton dynamics in non-fullerene acceptor blend polymeric systems,2021,"Non-fullerene type acceptors (NFA) have gained attention owing to their spectral extension that enables efficient solar energy capturing. For instance, the solely NFA-mediated absorbing region contributes to the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as ~30%, in the case of the solar cells comprised of fluorinated materials, PBDB-T-2F and ITIC-4F. This implies that NFAs must be able to serve as electron donors, even though they are conventionally assigned as electron acceptors. Therefore, the pathways of NFA-originated excitons need to be explored by the spectrally resolved photovoltaic characters. Additionally, excitation wavelength dependent transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was performed to trace the nature of the NFA-originated excitons and polymeric donor-originated excitons separately. Unique origin-dependent decay behaviors of the blend system were found by successive comparing of those solutions and pristine films which showed a dramatic change upon film formation. With the obtained experimental results, including TAS, a possible model describing origin-dependent decay pathways was suggested in the framework of reaction kinetics. Finally, numerical simulations based on the suggested model were performed to verify the feasibility, achieving reasonable correlation with experimental observables. The results should provide deeper insights in to renewable energy strategies by using novel material classes that are compatible with flexible electronics."
29,29,10.1002/adma.202100474,,,A Quinoxaline-Based D–A Copolymer Donor Achieving 17.62% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells,2021,"Side-chain engineering has been an effective strategy in tuning electronic energy levels, intermolecular interaction, and aggregation morphology of organic photovoltaic materials, which is very important for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two D-A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on bithienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the donor (D) unit, difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) with different side chains as the acceptor (A) unit, and thiophene as the π-bridges. PBQ6 with two alkyl-substituted fluorothiophene side chains on the DFQ units possesses redshifted absorption, stronger intermolecular interaction, and higher hole mobility than PBQ5 with two alkyl side chains on the DFQ units. The blend film of the PBQ6 donor with the Y6 acceptor shows higher and balanced hole/electron mobilities, less charge carrier recombination, and more favorable aggregation morphology. Therefore, the OSC based on PBQ6:Y6 achieves a PCE as high as 17.62% with a high fill factor of 77.91%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (15.55%) of the PBQ5:Y6-based OSC. The PCE of 17.62% is by far one of the highest efficiencies for the binary OSCs with polymer donor and Y6 acceptor."
30,30,10.1016/j.dyepig.2021.109330,,,Phenothiazine based organic dyes for dye sensitized solar cells: A theoretical study on the role of π-spacer,2021,"Abstract In this contribution, six new organic dyes were investigated by the density functional theory (DFT). The electron-donor unit is a phenothiazine fragment substituted by an ethynyl-pyrene unit while the electron acceptor group is the cyanoacrylic acid for all sensitizers; the π-linker was changed and its effect investigated. The dye baring dioxythiophene linker has the highest absorption maxima. The theoretical photovoltaic properties indicated that the over-all yield of the solar cell could be remarkably improved with the designed dyes. The results showed that all the studied organic dyes are potential candidates as photosensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)."
31,31,10.1002/adfm.202100387,,,Enhancement of Photovoltaic Current through Dark States in Donor-Acceptor Pairs of Tungsten-Based Transition Metal Di-Chalcogenides,2021,"As several photovoltaic materials experimentally approach the Shockley– Queisser limit, there has been a growing interest in unconventional materials and approaches with the potential to cross this efficiency barrier. One such candidate is dark state protection induced by the dipole–dipole interaction between molecular excited states. This phenomenon has been shown to significantly reduce carrier recombination rate and enhance photon-to-current conversion, in elementary models consisting of few interacting chromophore centers. Atomically thin 2D transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDCs) have shown great potential for use as ultrathin photovoltaic materials in solar cells due to their favorable photon absorption and electronic transport properties. TMDC alloys exhibit tunable direct bandgaps and significant dipole moments. In this work, the dark state protection mechanism has been introduced to a TMDC based photovoltaic system with pure tungsten diselenide (WSe2) as the acceptor material and the TMDC alloy tungsten sulfo-selenide (WSeS) as the donor material. Our numerical model demonstrates the first application of the dark state protection mechanism to a photovoltaic material with a photon current enhancement of up to 35% and an ideal photon-to-current efficiency exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit."
32,32,10.1016/j.synthmet.2021.116756,,,Effect of alkylthiolated hetero-aromatic rings on the photovoltaic performance of benzodithiophene-based polymer/fullerene solar cells,2021,"Abstract Three new donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) with alkylthiolated aromatic rings furan, thiophene, and benzene and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) units, namely PBDTFS-DTBT, PBDTTS-DTBT, and PBDTPS-DTBT, respectively, were synthesized and applied in solution-processed fullerene type organic solar cells (OSCs). The target polymers were systematically investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra, cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory (DFT) and photovoltaic measurements. The experimental results imply that the electron push-pull effect and torsion angles between the conjugated side hetero-aromatic rings and BDT core play a key role in tuning the optical absorption bands, molecular energy levels, hole mobilities, and morphology of the corresponding polymers. The OSCs based on PBDTTS-DTBT and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) show the highest power conversion eﬃciency (PCE) of 7.80% among the three polymeric analogues, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.95 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 70.76%. Hence, the results in this work indicate that the photovoltaic properties of the BDT-BT-based polymers can be eﬀectively modulated by introducing conjugated alkylthiolated hetero-aromatic rings with the varied electron donating ability and steric hindrance."
34,34,10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100658,,,Achieve panchromatic absorption for all-small-molecule organic solar cells based on mono-porphyrin molecules by π-bridge modification,2021,"Abstract Porphyrin small molecules have been widely used in organic solar cells in recent years. However, further improvement of device efficiency is restricted owing to the absorption defects between Soret and Q bands of porphyrin donors and the limitation of application. The aim of this study was to compensate for its inherent defects and explore the photoelectric properties combined with the non-fused non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) to increase its universality. To achieve this goal, seven mono-porphyrin donor molecules with A-π-D-π-A configuration (SM1-SM7) were designed by modifying the π-bridges. The results indicate that π-bridge and side chains can lead to different ways of intramolecular charge transfer, which obtaining a new absorption peak between Soret and Q bands while the absorption range was extended to a near-infrared region (up to 1200 nm). When combined with the NFA, the larger ratios of intermolecular charge transfer and recombination rates (kinter-CT/kinter-CR) exceed 1011, which is conducive to obtaining higher short circuit current (JSC). At the same time, the open-circuit voltages (VOC) of devices were close to and/or higher than 1.0 V, indicating that the imbalance between JSC and VOC will be broken. Finally, we hope that this work can provide a strategy for designing potential panchromatic absorption donor molecules."
35,35,10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100633,,,"Novel thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-embedded small-molecule donors for highly efficient and photostable vacuum-processed organic photovoltaics",2021,"Abstract Four thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT)-based donor-π-acceptor–type small-molecule donors DTCPTT, DTCPTT-2CN, DTDCPTT, and DTDCPTT-2CN were synthesized and characterized. A clear structure-property relationship correlating the effects of introducing cyano groups onto the TT and the end-capping groups has been successfully established. DTDCPTT and DTDCPTT-2CN were adopted as electron donors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) mainly due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer absorption in the visible light region, sufficiently high thermal stability, and appropriate energy level alignment with C70. Moreover, the analyses of crystal structures reveal that DTDCPTT and DTDCPTT-2CN form antiparallel dimer pairs through strong dipolar and non-covalent intermolecular interactions. X-ray structures also indicate that introducing cyano groups onto the TT moiety does not affect the backbone planarity significantly. Compared with DTDCPTT-2CN, the more compact and uniform crystal packing renders DTDCPTT advantageous for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. DTDCPTT-based device achieves power conversion efficiency as high as 7.81% and 16.89%, respectively, under simulated AM 1.5G illumination and 500 lux TLD-840 fluorescent lamp illumination, which could be attributed to stronger absorption and better photocurrent extraction. In addition, both devices exhibit high stability under continuous simulated 1 sun illumination for more than 300 h. As far as we know, this is the best performance for vacuum-processed small-molecule indoor OPVs to date."

The BTP-BO-4F and Y6 have the similar optical bandgap and different absorption coefficients. The corresponding binary SMPVs exhibit different short circuit current density (JSC) (20.38 vs. 23.24 mA cm-2), and fill factor (FF) (70.77% vs. 67.21%). A 14.46% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is acquired in ternary SMPVs with 30 wt% Y6, companied with a JSC of 24.17 mA cm-2, a FF of 68.78% and an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.87 V. The improvement on PCE of ternary SMPVs should originate from the well trade-off between phase separation and photon harvesting of ternary active layers by incorporating 30 wt% Y6 in acceptors. This work may deliver insight onto the improved performance of SMPVs by superposing the superiorities of binary SMPVs with similar optical bandgap acceptors into one ternary cell."

Here, we systematically investigate the photovoltaic behaviors of PM6:Y6 solar cells with different stoichiometries. It is found that the photovoltaic performance is tolerant to PM6 contents ranging from 10 to 60 wt %. Especially an impressive efficiency over 10% has been achieved in dilute donor solar cells with 10 wt % PM6 enabled by efficient charge generation, electron/hole transport, slow charge recombination, and field-insensitive extraction. This raises the question about the origin of efficient hole transport in such dilute donor structure. By investigating hole mobilities of PM6 diluted in Y6 and insulators, we find that effective hole transport pathway is mainly through PM6 phase in PM6:Y6 blends despite with low PM6 content. The results indicate that a low fraction of polymer donors combines with near-infrared nonfullerene acceptors could achieve high photovoltaic performance, which might be a candidate for semitransparent windows."

Herein, double-ester-substituted thiophenes and thienothiophenes are incorporated as third building blocks into the donor polymer PBDB-TF, developing two groups of terpolymers with donor-acceptor 1-donor-acceptor 2 (D-A1-D-A2)-type backbones. An optimum 10% concentration of double-ester-substituted thiophene units in PBDB-TF-T10 downshifts the molecular energy and increases the dielectric constant, and delivers proper miscibility and nanostructure in blends with the high-performing acceptor Y6. These characteristics are designed to synergistically enhance the photovoltage, photocurrent, and efficiency of PSCs. The resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.4% surpasses the conventional PBDB-TF/Y6 PSCs, and it is among the best-performing PSCs based on PBDB-TF-derived terpolymers. Gratifyingly, PBDB-TF-T10 does not show significant batch-to-batch variation and it retains high PCEs above 16% in a broad range of molecular weights. This work introduces a facile strategy to easily synthesize terpolymers in combination with Y6 for the attainment of high-performing and reproducible non-fullerene PSCs."

The introduction of fused rings on the donor unit of AJ303 presented an appropriate energy level, less recombination and longer electron lifetime to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.2%, far above that achieved for AJ301 of 6.2% with a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based electrolyte under standard AM1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The DSSCs based on AJ303 and AJ301 with [Cu(tmby)2]2+/+-based electrolyte showed a lower PCE of 8.2% and 5.4%, respectively. Therefore, the results indicated that the introduction of a fused-ring in the donor group is a meaningful synthetic strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance."

Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that molecularly tuning of side chains on BT moeity simultaneously influences the energy levels and intermolecular packing of the resulted polymers by modulating their electron affinity and molecular coplanarity. The polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a blend of PB-BTf/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) exhibits the best photovoltaic performance among the three copolymers, with a open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.43%. Furthermore, polymer PB-BTPf containing fluorophenyl groups shows a higher Voc of 0.99 V due to its more low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) compared with other two structural polymeric analogues. The results here provide further fundamental insights into the relationship between the fluorination on electron-withdrawing moiety and the photovoltaic performance for the conjugated polymers applied in fullerene organic solar cells."

The ester groups and difluorine substituents are introduced into the EF-Qx unit to improve the electron affinity. The polymers containing EF-Qx unit exhibit a relatively narrow bandgap of around 1.6 eV. To optimize the effects of solubility and molecular packing, D-A structure and D-A1-D-A2 structure synthesis strategies are adopted in this work and the structure-property relationship is systematically studied. The results morphology characterizations indicate that the active layer based on D-A structure polymer PTT-EFQX has a superior morphology compared to active layer based on D-A1-D-A2 structure polymer PT-DFBT-T-EFQX, which helps PTT-EFQX-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) to obtain better PCEs of up to 5.4%.

However, manipulating morphology involving only small-molecule donors and acceptors is extremely challenging. Herein, a simple terminal alkyl chain engineering process is introduced to fine-tune the morphology towards high-performance all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs. We successfully chose a chlorinated two-dimension benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) central unit and two isomeric alkyl cyanoacetate as the end-capped moieties to conveniently synthesize two isomeric small-molecule donors, namely, BT-RO-Cl and BT-REH-Cl, each bearing linear n-octyl (O) as the terminal alkyl chain and another branched 2-ethylhexyl (EH) as the terminal alkyl chain. The terminal alkyl chain engineering process provided BT-RO-Cl with 13.35% efficiency and BT-REH-Cl with 13.90% efficiency ASM OSCs, both with Y6 as the electron acceptor. The successful performance resulted from uniform phase separation and the favorable combination of face-on and edge-on molecular stacking of blended small-molecule donors and acceptors, which formed a fluent 3D transport channel and thus delivered high and balanced carrier mobilities. These findings demonstrate that alkyl chain engineering can finely control the morphology of ASM OSCs, and provides an alternative for the optimal design of small-molecule materials towards high-performance ASM OSCs."

Chemical strategies, especially molecular structure design, have been proven to be crucial for polymer donor materials. In this work, two wide bandgap D-A copolymer donors composed of tripropylsilyl substituted bithienyl-benzodithiophene as donor (D) unit and dialkyl substituted bithiazole as acceptor (A) unit were designed and synthesized. By introducing thiophene π-bridges into the backbone, the miscibility and morphological properties of the materials are effectively tuned, leading to tremendous progress in power conversion efficiency from 0.95% to 10.73% with m-ITIC as the acceptor. The results demonstrate that manipulating molecular distortion can be an effective strategy to regulate molecular self-assembly behavior of the polymer donors and achieve excellent aggregation properties, blend miscibility, and photovoltaic performance of the PSCs."
48,48,10.1063/5.0049176,,,Vibration-mediated resonant charge separation across the donor-acceptor interface in an organic photovoltaic device,2021,"Examination of a recent open-system Ehrenfest dynamics simulation suggests that a vibration-mediate resonance may play a pivotal role in the charge transfer across a donor-acceptor interface in an organic solar cell. Based on this, a concise dissipative two-level electronic system coupled to a molecular vibrational mode is proposed and solved quantum mechanically. It is found that the charge transfer is enhanced substantially when the vibrational energy quanta is equal to the electronic energy loss across the interface. This vibration-mediate resonant charge transfer process is ultrafast, occurring within 100 fs, comparable to experimental findings. The open-system Ehrenfest dynamics simulation of the two-level model is carried out, and similar results are obtained, which confirms further that the earlier open-system Ehrenfest dynamics simulation indeed correctly predicted the occurrence of the resonant charge transfer across the donor-acceptor interface."

Here, we report a new electron-deficient monomer naphthalenothiophene imide (NTI) and NTI-based copolymers PNTB and PNTB-2T. The strong electron-withdrawing ability of NTI could effectively lower the HOMO level of the polymer that facilitates the tuning of the polymer’s physical properties while simultaneously maintaining the low-lying HOMO value. Polymer chains modification by introducing extra thiophenes results in the closed π−π stacking and ordered polymer chain packing of PNTB-2T and is proven to be an effective strategy to increase the device performance. Thus, solar cell devices for PNTB-2T:Y6 exhibit an efficiency of 16.72%, which is further enhanced to 17.35% by the third component PC71BM, whereas that for PNTB:Y6 is only 3.81%. Importantly, PNTB-2T-based devices exhibit excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility. These features make this family of polymer donors very promising and the design strategies will enlighten future development of high-performance polymer donors for organic solar cells (OSC)."

Because of the different linking positions of carboxylate in their thienothiophene unit, these polymers can be classified as two isomers and exhibit significantly different properties. A mixture of these two polymers was effectively applied as the donor for a highly reliable active layer in organic indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) because of its good miscibility, and especially, of its broad complementary absorption which overlapped the emission spectrum of the white light emitting diode lamp. The ternary IPV system, achieved by mixing the wide-bandgap TTE25 polymer with the medium-bandgap TTE36 polymer, followed by blending with [ 6 , 6 ]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), exhibited significantly enhanced open circuit voltage and short circuit current density, thus improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the IPV system. Compared to the TTE36:PC61BM-binary-blend-based IPV system, the TTE36:TTE25:PC61BM (0.8:0.2:1.0 wt. ratio)-ternary-blend-based IPV system exhibited an increase in PCE from 6.81% to 11.15% under 1000 lux white LED light illumination. These results indicate that the addition of TTE25 to the TTE36:PC61BM binary blend improves the morphology and light-harvesting properties of the active layer."

One key to their success is efficient charge separation with low potential loss at the donor-acceptor heterojunction. Due to the lack of spectroscopic probes, open questions remain about the mechanisms of charge separation. Here, we study charge separation of a model system composed of the donor, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1',3'-di-2-thienyl-5',7'-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1',2'-c:4',5'-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione) (PBDB-T), and the nonfullerene acceptor, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene (ITIC), using multidimensional spectroscopy spanning the visible to the mid-infrared. We find that bound polaron pairs (BPPs) generated within ITIC domains play a dominant role in efficient hole transfer, transitioning to delocalized polarons within 100 fs. The weak electron-hole binding within the BPPs and the resulting polaron delocalization are key factors for efficient charge separation at nearly zero driving force. Our work provides useful insight into how to further improve the power conversion efficiency in OPVs."

Absorption spectra of investigated PDI derivatives cover whole UV-Visible region which indicate that studied molecules could be used efficiently for photovoltaics. The R*(λmax – λmin) value of PDI derivatives is red shifted due to CN substitution while it resulted in slightly blue shift due to NO2 substitution. In addition, reorganization energy (λ) values found to be lowered by all substituents but more efficiently by SO2 and CN substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential surfaces and chemical reactivity indices have also been calculated to verify results. Furthermore, investigated acceptor molecules have been matched with suitable donors (based on benzo [2.1-b:3.4-b′] dithiophene derivatives D1–D5) to verify their practical efficiency. The calculated open circuit voltage (Voc) of investigated PDI derivatives is fairly high with donors D1 (0.95–1.34) and D2 (0.54–0.92).

Key for their performance is the microstructure of the light-absorbing organic bulk heterojunction. To study this, organic solar films composed of both fullerene C60 as electron acceptor and different mole percentages of di-[4-(N,N-di-p-tolyl-amino)-phenyl]-cyclohexane (TAPC) as electron donor were evaporated in vacuum in different mixing ratios (5, 50 and 95 mol%) on an ITO-coated glass substrate held at room temperature and at 110 °C. The microstructure of the C60: TAPC heterojunction was studied by grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering to understand the effect of substrate heating. By increasing the substrate temperature from ambient to 110 °C, it was found that no significant change was observed in the crystal size for the C60: TAPC concentrations investigated in this study. In addition to the variation done in the substrate temperature, the variation of the mole percent of the donor (TAPC) was studied to conclude the effect of both the substrate temperature and the donor concentration on the microstructure of the OSC films. Bragg peaks were attributed to C60 in the pure C60 sample and in the blend with low donor mole percentage (5%), but the C60 peaks became nondiscernible when the donor mole percentage was increased to 50% and above, showing that TAPC interrupted the formation of C60 crystals."

The more orthogonal spatial configuration of ZnP-4ThDPP was favorable for constructing additional charge pathways, which was in accord with the results from photoluminescence quenching efficiency, charge transport ability and thickness sensitivity evaluation. The results in this work enriched the category of star-shaped porphyrin-derivatives and might afford guidelines into the structure-property correlation of various linkers-based small-molecule photovoltaic materials."

In this contribution, two novel low-bandgap donor-acceptor copolymers, P1-3T and P2-3T2F, consisting of electron-accepting benzothiadiazole acceptor segment and electron-donating terthiophene donor segment with and without fluorine atoms were designed and synthesized. The density functional theory calculations and ultraviolet–visible absorption studies demonstrate that the fluorinated P2-3T2F polymer has more planar backbone conformation, deeper HOMO level, broader absorption spectrum with a vibronic shoulder peak, and higher absorption coefficient compared with the non-fluorinated analogue polymer, P1-3T. Furthermore, P2-3T2F exhibits good crystallinity and high hole mobility, presumably due to the well-ordered lamellar packing and the π-π stacking interaction between the backbones of the conjugated polymers. The optimized polymer solar cell based on P2-3T2F:PC61BM exhibits a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.77 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 68.99%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V, and a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.14%, which is approximately 46% higher than that of the P1-3T:PC61BM device. The enhanced PCE is primarily due to increased light-harvesting ability and interconnected morphology with finely dispersed polymer-rich and PC61BM-rich domains, which improves the efficiency of exciton dissociation and rises the mobility of charge carriers, thus boosting the short-circuit current density and the FF value. Moreover, the relatively deep HOMO of P2-3T2F effectively increases the Voc."

Herein, we synthesized a carboxylate substituted pyrazine-based electron-deficient building block (DTCPz) with a simple structure and low synthetic cost, and then developed a novel wide bandgap polymer donor PFBCPZ. Due to the synergistic electron-withdrawing effects of the fluorination in donor unit (BDT-TF) and esterification and C=N double-bond in DTCPz unit, PFBCPZ shows a deeper HOMO level of −5.60 eV, a strong intermolecular π-π interaction, good crystallinity and stacking, and high hole-mobility of 2.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Matched with a low bandgap acceptor IT-4F, excellent charge transfer, weak recombination, and small non-radiative energy loss in OSCs was achieved, resulting in an impressive fill factor of 0.785 and a high open-circuit voltage of 0.92 V. As a result, a PCE of up to 15.3% is obtained in OSCs, which is the highest value in the IT-4F-based binary OSCs so far and indicates that low-cost DTCPz with a simple structure is a promising building block to construct high-performance polymer donors for application in efficient OSCs."
65,65,10.1021/jacs.0c13352,,,Nonradiative Triplet Loss Suppressed in Organic Photovoltaic Blends with Fluoridated Nonfullerene Acceptors,2021,"In organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends, photogenerated excitons dissociate into charge-separated electrons and holes at donor/acceptor interfaces. The bimolecular recombination of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes may cause nonradiative loss by forming the low-lying triplet excited states (T1) via the intermediate charge-transfer triplet states. Here, we show that such a spin-related loss channel can be suppressed in the OPV blends with fluorinated nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). By combining ultrafast optical spectroscopy and triplet sensitization measurements, the T1 states at the acceptors have been observed to generate from the charge-separated electrons and holes in the OPV blends with a same polymer donor and two sets of NFAs with and without fluorination. The triplet formation is largely suppressed and the lifetime of charge carrier is markedly prolonged in the blends with fluorinated NFAs. The fluorination effect on the charge dynamics can be ascribed to the modified energy alignment between the triplet excited states of charge-transfer and locally excited characters as supported by quantum chemical computation. Our findings explain the mechanism responsible for the improved photocurrent generation in the OPV blends with fluorinated NFAs, suggesting that manipulating the energy landscape of triplet excited states is a promising strategy for further optimizing OPV devices."

However, NIR NFAs with absorption above 1000 nm, which is of great importance for application in NIR OPDs for bioimaging, remote communication, night surveillance, etc., are still rare due to the scarcity of strong electron-rich cores. We report herein a new dithiophene building block, namely PDT, which exhibits the strongest electron-donating ability among the widely used dithiophene building blocks. By applying PDT and PDTT as the electron-donating cores and DFIC as the electron-accepting terminals, we developed two new NIR electron acceptors, PDTIC-4F and PDTTIC-4F, with optical absorptions up to 1030 nm, surpassing that of the well-known O6T-4F acceptor. In comparison with the carbon-oxygen-bridged core COi8 in O6T-4F, the synthetic complexity of PDT and PDTT is significantly reduced. Conventional OPV devices based on PM6:PDTTIC-4F display power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10.70% with a broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) response from the ultraviolet-visible to the infrared, leading to a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.90 mA cm-2. Encouraged by these results, we investigated inverted PM6:PDTTIC-4F-based OPD devices by suppressing the dark current via modulation of the film thickness. The optimal OPD device exhibits compelling performance metrics that can compete with those of commercial silicon photodiodes: a record responsivity of 0.55 A W-1 (900 nm) among photodiode-type OPDs and excellent shot-noise-limited specific detectivity (Dsh*) of over 1013 jones."

In this work, we report two conjugated polymers (P3TCO-D and P3TCO-DMO) with the same conjugated backbone, the only difference in alkyl chains of carbonyl units (n-decyl and 3,7-dimethyloctyl). Both polymers have similar molecular weights, polydispersity indexes, and molecular energy levels. The P3TCO-D has a stronger aggregation behavior than P3TCO-DMO. Interestingly, both pure polymer films have similar surface morphology. After blending with an electron acceptor of IT-4F, P3TCO-D: IT-4F film shows remarkable increased surface roughness of 23.2 nm and phase-separation. In contrast, 3TCO-DMO: IT-4F film displays slightly increased surface roughness of 3.82 nm and good phase-separation. In polymer solar cells, the P3TCO-D-based device gives a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, while the P3TCO-DMO-based device produces a better PCE of 12.8%. This work demonstrates that the optimization of side chains in the twisted conjugated polymers is very important to improve their photovoltaic performances."
69,69,10.1021/acsami.0c21986,,,Backbone Engineering with Asymmetric Core to Finely Tune Phase Separation for High-Performance All-Small-Molecule Organic Solar Cells,2021,"In order to obtain high-performance all-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs), it is crucial to exploit the available strategy for molecular design and to further understand key structure-property relationship that can rationally control the blend nanomorphology and influence the physical process. In this work, we design two small molecule donors FBD-S1 and TBD-S2 with identical electron-withdrawing units but various asymmetric central cores, which exhibit differing phase separation in Y6-based blend films. It is found that TBD-S2 with increased phase separation between donor and acceptor can lead to more favorable interpenetrating networks, effective exciton dissociation, and enhanced and more balanced charge transport. Importantly, a remarkable PCE of 13.1% is obtained for TBD-S2:Y6 based ASM-OSCs, which is an attractive photovoltaic performance for ASM-OSCs. This result demonstrates that the central core modification at the atomic level for small molecule donors can delicately control the phase separation and optimize photophysical processes, and refines device performance, which facilitate development in the ASM-OSC research field."
70,70,10.1039/d0qm00980f,,,"Nanomorphology of eco-friendly colloidal inks, relating non-fullerene acceptor surface energy to structure formation",2021,"Nanoengineered, eco-friendly, solution-processable electroactive materials are in demand for the growing field of printed electronics, and these material requirements can be achieved by the development of waterborne colloidal dispersions. Functionality in these composite materials can be tuned by thermodynamically modifying the material nanomorphology, often by creation of kinetically stabilized aqueous nanoparticle dispersions. In this work we demonstrate that the internal structure of organic nanoparticles is controlled by the surface energy difference between the polymeric donor material and the non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) material. Nanoparticles of the following donor–acceptor combinations, suitable for printed organic photovoltaics, have been synthesized: TQ1:N2200, TQ1:PNDIT10, P3HT:N2200, P3HT:o-IDTBR and P3HT:eh-IDTBR. Advanced synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy and microscopy are used to correlate the formation of core–shell nanoparticle morphology to the material surface energy. We subsequently present a viable avenue for customizing the blended nanoparticle structure into (i) core–shell, (ii) molecularly intermixed, or (iii) inverted shell–core structures. Our results showed that TQ1:PNDIT10 and P3HT:o-IDTBR nanoparticles were comprised of a donor-rich shell and an NFA-rich core, however, interestingly we show a reversal to the inverse NFA shell/donor core structure for TQ1:N2200, P3HT:N2200 and P3HT:eh-IDTBR nanoparticles, driven by the low surface energy of N2200 (23.7 mJ m−2) and eh-IDTBR (18.3 mJ m−2). This article is the first report of a flipped nanoparticle core–shell morphology comprising an NFA-rich shell for the miniemulsion synthesis route. The composition of the shells and cores was able to be controlled by the differential mismatch in the surface energy of the donor and acceptor materials, with ΔGsurface > 0, ΔGsurface = 0, and ΔGsurface < 0 for acceptor core–donor shell, molecularly intermixed, and acceptor shell–donor core, respectively. Accordingly, we introduce an entirely overlooked new figure of merit (FoM) for customizing nanoparticulate colloidal inks: tunable surface energy of non-fullerene-based semiconductors. The establishment of this FoM opens up electroactive material design to a wide range of functional printing applications with varying device and ink structure requirements, thereby reshaping the nanoengineering toolkit for waterborne colloidal dispersions and hence printed electronics."
71,71,10.1039/d0tc05178k,,,Balancing photovoltaic parameters to enhance device performance of fluorene-fused heptacyclic small-molecule acceptors through varying terminal groups and polymer donors,2021,"Balancing photovoltaic parameters is very challenging to optimize the device performance of nonfullerene small-molecule acceptor (SMA)-based polymer solar cells (PSCs). We herein employed electron-withdrawing fluorinated or chlorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (ICF or ICCl) as the terminal acceptor (A) group to develop two acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) SMAs, DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl, with an electron-rich fluorene-fused dithienocyclopentafluorene as the identical central donor (D) core. Compared with the nonhalogenated counterpart (DTCFO-IC), the two halogenated SMAs possessed a red-shifted absorption spectrum, reduced optical bandgap, and increased charge carrier mobility, but these were accompanied by down-shifted HOMO and LUMO levels, especially for the chlorinated molecule (DTCFO-ICCl). Accordingly, with respect to DTCFO-IC, PSCs based on the two halogenated SMAs with polymer PBDB-T as a donor exhibited an improved Jsc, but a dropped Voc, thus leading to a commensurate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.80% for DTCFO-ICF and an increased PCE of 8.55% for DTCFO-ICCl. To further improve the device performance by means of balancing photovoltaic parameters, polymer PBDB-TF with a lower-lying HOMO level relative to PBDB-T was used to replace PBDB-T as the donor. The PCEs of PBDB-TF-based PSCs were further improved mainly due to the significantly enhanced Voc. Importantly, the DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs achieved a high PCE of up to 11.03% along with an increased Voc (0.93 V), a further increased Jsc (18.80 mA cm−2), and almost retained FF (63.1%). The enhanced device performance could be attributed to better charge transport and collection abilities, less charge recombination and more optimal active layer morphology. These results argue that combining the halogenation on the A group of an A–D–A acceptor and variation of the paired polymer donor could be an effective strategy to enhance the device efficiency by balancing photovoltaic parameters."

73,73,10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.109116,,,Effect of the mode of fixation of the thienyl rings on the electronic properties of electron acceptors based on indacenodithiophene (IDT),2021,"Abstract Indacenodithiophene (IDT) is a major building block for the design of advanced functional π-conjugated polymers and nonfullerene electron-acceptor materials for organic photovoltaics. Preliminary results of a synthetic approach aiming at the modulation of the electronic properties of IDT-based acceptors by modification of the mode of linkage of the thiophene rings with the median phenyl ring are presented. The synthesis of three acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) structures corresponding to the different possible modes of thiophene-phenyl connection (1–3) is described and their electronic properties are discussed on the basis of the results of UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and theoretical calculations."
74,74,10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.109085,,,Crystallinity dictates the selection of fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors in a small molecule organic solar cell,2021,"Abstract The side chains of a molecule affect the molecular packing and crystallinity which are crucial factors determining the photovoltaic properties in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two small molecule donors, BDT(X1) and BDT(X2), with identical backbone and slightly different side chains on the end groups have been designed and synthesized. Compared with BDT(X1) with linear alkyl chain, BDT(X2) featuring a branched alkyl chain in the terminal groups has larger steric hindrance and exhibits weaker crystallinity and less compact molecule stacking. Application of the two small molecule donors in OSCs shows that BDT(X1) is more suitable for IDIC, a non-fullerene acceptor, while BDT(X2) demonstrates higher OSC performance when blended with fullerene acceptor PC71BM. Morphology and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies reveal that crystallinity plays a key role in determining the molecular packing and phase separation with fullerene/non-fullerene acceptors which in turn influence the charge transport and photovoltaic properties. Our results provide some guidance on selection of acceptors for a given donor and demonstrate the importance of fine tuning of the crystallinity in small molecule OSCs."
75,75,10.1016/j.jlumin.2020.117837,,,Large-area luminescent solar concentrator utilizing donor-acceptor luminophore with nearly zero reabsorption: Indoor/outdoor performance evaluation,2021,"Abstract Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are light-guides doped with luminophores that can spectrally and spatially concentrate solar radiation. With the ability to harvest both direct and diffuse light, LSCs are considered attractive prospects for building-integrated photovoltaic applications. However, it is still challenging to develop organic luminophores based large-area LSCs that work well in various illumination conditions. Reabsorption, caused by small stokes shift of typical organic luminophores, often limits the performance of large-area LSCs. This study reports an indoor and outdoor performance of large-area (≥100 cm2) LSCs that employ a donor-acceptor luminophore with a large Stokes shift. The largest (400cm2) LSC demonstrates an optical efficiency (ηopt) of 5.5% and 7.6% under outdoor (AM 1.5G) and indoor (white LED) illuminations, respectively. Furthermore, the aesthetic and visual comfort parameters such as chromaticity coordinates, color rendering index, and average visible transmission are obtained that suggest the suitability of our LSCs for a built environment."
77,77,10.1016/j.jechem.2020.05.060,,,Effects of structure and electronic properties of D-π-A organic dyes on photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells,2021,"Abstract Herein, we examine the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells containing five D-π-A organic dyes designed by systematic modification of π-bridge size and geometric structure. Each dye has a simple push-pull structure with a triarylamino group as an electron donor, bithiophene-4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b’]dithiophene (M11), 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b’]dithiophene-thiophene (M12), thiophene-4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b’]dithiophene (M13), 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b’]dithiophene-benzene (M14), and 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b’]dithiophene (M15) units as π-bridges, and cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor/anchor. The extension of the π-bridge linkage favors wide-range absorption but, because of the concomitant molecular volume increase, hinders the efficient adsorption of dyes on the TiO2 film surface. Hence, higher loadings are achieved for smaller dye molecules, resulting in (i) a shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge to more negative values, (ii) a greater photocurrent, and (iii) suppressed charge recombination between the photoanode and the redox couple in the electrolyte. Consequently, under one-sun equivalent illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW/cm2), the highest photovoltage, photocurrent, and conversion efficiency (η = 7.19%) are observed for M15, which has the smallest molecular volume among M series dyes."
78,78,10.1088/1361-6463/abddfc,,,Electronic properties of donor:acceptor complexes in all-polymer solar cells based on density functional theory,2021,"The electronic properties at the donor (D):acceptor (A) interface are a crucial factor in determining the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices. Here, based on first-principles calculations, the electronic properties of ten configuration complexes composed of D polymer PDPPTPT and A polymer PNDI2OD-TVT were simulated. Results show that the bandgap values of the homo-/heterojunctions decrease with the increase of the number of molecular layers, and that of AAA is close to zero. This indicates that the homogeneous stacking is favorable for charge transport; furthermore, the bandgap of the complexes is affected by the molecular arrangement. Through the differential charge density and Bader charge analysis method, it was found that charge transfer will occur intermolecularly, which promotes the formation of a dipole moment at the D:A interface, and the dipole electric field then helps the dissociation of excitons in the active layer. The amount of charge transfer at the D:A interface in the DDA, DAA and DDAA configurations is about twice that in the DA configuration alone, demonstrating that homogeneous accumulation in complexes can enhance the interface dipole interaction. The comprehensive analysis suggests that homogeneous accumulation is conducive to charge transport, that heterogeneous stacking helps to promote exciton dissociation, and that there should be an optimal ratio. Furthermore, the dipole electric fields formed at the D:A interface exhibit the characteristics of local and non-uniform distribution."
80,80,10.1021/acsami.0c17598,,,Effects of Halogenated End Groups on the Performance of Nonfullerene Acceptors,2021,"The end groups' halogenations among the nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) were a very useful method to fabricate high-performance NFAs-based organic solar cells (OSCs). We report three high-performance NFAs, BTIC-4EO-4F, BTIC-4EO-4Cl, and BTIC-4EO-4Br. They all have a fused benzothiadiazole as the core unit and different dihalogenated end groups (IC-2F, IC-2Cl, and IC-2Br) as the terminal unit. Thanks to the improved intramolecular charge-transfer ability of the brominated NFAs, bromination is more effective than fluorination and chlorination in lowering the energy levels and red-shifting the absorption spectra of the resulting NFAs. When compared with the chlorinated and fluorinated counterparts, the BTIC-4EO-4Br blend films exhibit lower roughness, better phase separation size, and stronger face-on stacking. When blended with poly{[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluoro-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']-dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-alt-[2,5-thiophenediyl[5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,8-dioxo-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']dithiophene-1,3-diyl]]} (PBDB-TF) as the polymer donor material, the BTIC-4EO-4Br-based OSCs exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency (12.41%), with a higher current density and a higher open-circuit voltage than the BTIC-4EO-4Cl-based OSCs (11.29%) and BTIC-4EO-4F-based OSCs (10.64%). These results show that the bromination of the NFAs' electron-withdrawing end groups can also be very effective in constructing high-performance photovoltaic materials."
81,81,10.1021/acsami.0c17722,,,Nonconjugated Terpolymer Acceptors with Two Different Fused-Ring Electron-Deficient Building Blocks for Efficient All-Polymer Solar Cells,2021,"The ternary polymerization strategy of incorporating different donor and acceptor units forming terpolymers as photovoltaic materials has been proven advantageous in improving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a series of low band gap nonconjugated terpolymer acceptors based on two different fused-ring electron-deficient building blocks (IDIC16 and ITIC) with adjustable photoelectric properties were developed. As the third component, ITIC building blocks with a larger π-conjugation structure, shorter solubilizing side chains, and red-shifted absorption spectrum were incorporated into an IDIC16-based nonconjugated copolymer acceptor PF1-TS4, which built up the terpolymers with two conjugated building blocks linked by flexible thioalkyl chain-thiophene segments. With the increasing ITIC content, terpolymers show gradually broadened absorption spectra and slightly down-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels. The active layer based on terpolymer PF1-TS4-60 with a 60% ITIC unit presents more balanced hole and electron mobilities, higher photoluminescence quenching efficiency, and improved morphology compared to those based on PF1-TS4. In all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), PF1-TS4-60, matched with a wide band gap polymer donor PM6, achieved a similar open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V, a dramatically increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.30 mA cm–2, and fill factor (FF) of 61.4% compared to PF1-TS4 (Voc = 0.99 V, Jsc = 11.21 mA cm–2, and FF = 55.6%). As a result, the PF1-TS4-60-based all-PSCs achieved a PCE of 9.31%, which is ∼50% higher than the PF1-TS4-based ones (6.17%). The results demonstrate a promising approach to develop high-performance nonconjugated terpolymer acceptors for efficient all-PSCs by means of ternary polymerization using two different A–D–A-structured fused-ring electron-deficient building blocks."
82,82,10.1063/5.0037710,,,Relationship between charge transfer state electroluminescence and the degradation of organic photovoltaics,2021,"The degradation of archetype organic photovoltaics comprising both vacuum and solution-deposited bulk heterojunction active regions is investigated and quantified using a theory based on detailed balance, which relates the open-circuit voltage to the efficiency of charge transfer state emission. To describe this relationship, we account for the difference between electroluminescent external quantum efficiency and the charge transfer emission efficiency. An empirical factor, m, is introduced to distinguish between nonradiative defect sites both within, m = 1, and outside, m >1, of the photoactive heterojunction. The m-factor is used to determine the primary sources of degradation for archetype solution- and vacuum-processed material systems. We conclude that degradation occurs primarily within the donor–acceptor heterojunction for the vacuum-processed devices (where m = 1.020 ± 0.002) and outside of the photoactive heterojunction for the solution-processed devices studied, both with and without an anode buffer layer (where m = 2.93 ± 0.09 and m = 1.90 ± 0.01, respectively)."

The copolymer was found to be soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene with excellent film forming properties. The thermal, optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of PBDFNBO were investigated in detail. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicate that the copolymer possesses good thermal stability. The PBDFNBO film exhibits a narrow absorption band around 300–598 nm (with an optical bandgap of 2.07 eV). The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PBDFNBO/PC71BM (1 : 2, w/w) reaches 5.0% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.9 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.53 under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination."
84,84,10.1039/d0ee02958k,,,Predicting the photocurrent-composition dependence in organic solar cells,2021,"The continuous development of improved non-fullerene acceptors and deeper knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms governing performance underpin the vertiginous increase in efficiency witnessed by organic photovoltaics. While the influence of parameters like film thickness and morphology are generally understood, what determines the strong dependence of the photocurrent on the donor and acceptor fractions remains elusive. Here we approach this problem by training artificial intelligence algorithms with self-consistent datasets consisting of thousands of data points obtained by high-throughput evaluation methods. Two ensemble learning methods are implemented, namely a Bayesian machine scientist and a random decision forest. While the former demonstrates large descriptive power to complement the experimental high-throughput screening, the latter is found to predict with excellent accuracy the photocurrent–composition phase space for material systems outside the training set. Interestingly, we identify highly predictive models that only employ the materials band gaps, thus largely simplifying the rationale of the photocurrent–composition space."

Herein, two chlorinated D‐A conjugated polymers PBBD‐Cl‐α and PBBD‐Cl‐β are synthesized based on two new building blocks (TTO‐Cl‐α and TTO‐Cl‐β) respectively by introducing the chlorine atom into α or β position of the upper thiophene of the highly electron‐deficient benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐c′]dithiophene‐4,8‐dione moiety. Single‐crystal analysis demonstrates that the chlorine‐free TTO shows a π‐π stacking distance (d π‐π) of 3.55 Å. When H atom at the α position of thiophene of TTO is replaced by Cl, both π‐π stacking distance (d π‐π = 3.48 Å) and Cl···S distance (d Cl‐S = 4.4 Å) are simultaneously reduced for TTO‐Cl‐α compared with TTO. TTO‐Cl‐β then showed the Cl···S non‐covalent interaction can further shorten the intermolecular π‐π stacking separation to 3.23 Å, much smaller than that of TTO‐Cl‐α and TTO. After blending with BTP‐eC9, PBBD‐Cl‐β:BTP‐eC9‐based PSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.20%, much higher than PBBD:BTP‐eC9 (10.06%) and PBBD‐Cl‐α:BTP‐eC9 (13.35%) based devices. These results provide an effective strategy for design and synthesis of highly efficient donor polymers by precise positioning of the chlorine substitution."

The P3HT crystals were composed of face-on ((1 0 0) and (0 0 2) prisms) and edge-on ((0 2 0) and (0 0 2) growth planes) oriented chains. The lowest d-spacing values were acquired for the QD decorated P3HT nanofibers (d(1 0 0) = 13.41–13.46 Ǻ and d(0 2 0) = 3.39–3.43 Ǻ). To investigate the function of designed supramolecules in roles of morphology modifier, donor, and acceptor, the ternary and binary photovoltaics of P3HT: ( Meissner and Wohrle, 1991 , Meissner and Wohrle, 1991 )-Phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM):supramolecule, P3HT:supramolecule, and PC71BM:supramolecule were prepared. The GQD-based nanostructures acted better than the CQD-based ones, originated from their thinner and disk-like nature, and the highest photovoltaic characteristics were detected in P3HT:PC71BM:GQD/P3HT nanofiber systems (14.06 mA cm−2, 0.70 V, 66.11%), leading to a performance of 6.50%. Thin films modified by crab-like GQD/P3HT short chain (5.47%), CQD/P3HT nanofiber (4.56%), and semicrab-like CQD/P3HT short chain (3.46%) nanostructures also reflected the high-quality devices. The systems manipulated by the crab/semicrab-like (668 and 462 Ω.cm2) and decorated fibrillar (553 and 395 Ω.cm2) nanostructures demonstrated the faster electron transport and, thereby the lower carrier recombination. Even the well-designed supramolecules of GQD/P3HT nanofiber and crab-like GQD/P3HT short chain led to the low-quality binary photovoltaics (3.68% and 2.29%) with respect to corresponding ternary systems. When the QDs and their associated nano-hybrids were employed as the electron donors, the weakest cells were fabricated and the highest efficacy was 2.01% for PC71BM:GQD/P3HT."

Direct (hetero)arylation polymerization reaction is a rising synthetic method, although most of the naphthalene diimide polymer photovoltaic acceptors have been prepared by classic Stille polymerization. A weak donor-strong acceptor polymer acceptor PNB2F has been successfully designed and synthesized by the two-step direct (hetero)arylation reaction and further applied in all-PSCs.

Crystallographic analysis, spectroscopic characterization and absorption-emission spectral properties were studied to understand the structural identity and electronic nature of the molecular compounds. Fabrication of a solar cell device using the diferrocenyl donor-acceptor compound as a bifunctional system showed a moderate open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 331 mV.

The improved solubility and hole mobility were obtained in comparison to their analogues using TPA as core. More interestingly, the TOBTC-2F:PC71BM blend exhibited highest hole mobility (μh) of 8.5 × 10−4 cm2V−1s−1 and its solution-processed organic solar cell displayed the best photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 4.5% at an area of 10 mm2 without any additive and annealing treatment. Here, the μh value is 10 times higher than that of its TPA based analogue:PC71BM blend. It indicates that the synergistic effect of the TPA-OMe unit in core and fluorine substituents in benzo-thiadiazole is available to improve solubility, mobility and photovoltaic properties of the star-shaped small molecular donors."

These new dyes TD01, TD02, and TD03 carry different number (one, two, and three, respectively) of donor-π-acceptor units, which are connected together with a central bridgehead nitrogen through oxyethyl linkers. After fabricating the solar cells using these sensitizers and investigating their photovoltaic performances, it was found that the DSSC based on TD03 sensitizer exhibited the best power conversion efficiency of 5.91%. The higher performance of TD03 compared to TD01 and TD02 sensitizers is attributed to its superior short-circuit current density and high open-circuit voltage resulted from the presence of tertiary anchoring and oxyethyl moieties, respectively."

The effect of structure evolution on crystallinity, absorption, mobility, morphology and photovoltaic properties was primarily investigated. It is found that, by simply inserting a D-A repeat unit, 5BDTBDD shows more improved crystallization, absorption, mobility and morphology than 3BDTBDD. As a result, 5BDTBDD exhibits better photovoltaic properties than 3BDTBDD in their non-fullerene organic solar cells using 9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis (4-hexylphenyl)-di thieno [2,3-d:2′,3′-d']-s-indaceno [1,2-b:5,6-b'] dithiophene (ITIC) as acceptor material. An increasing power conversion efficiency of 7.89% is obtained in the 5BDTBDD:ITIC cells, which is 1.8 times higher than that value (4.33%) in the 3BDTBDD:ITIC cells. It indicates that structure evolution from D-A-D type small molecule toward D-A-D-A-D type oligomer is an efficient strategy to achieve high-efficiency donor materials in organic solar cells."
92,92,10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.108959,,,Unravelling the miniscule size effect of auxiliary donor in D-D-π-A type dipolar photosensitizers on quasi-solid state DSSC performance,2021,"Abstract Three new dipolar organic dyes of the type D-D-π-A were constructed on fluorenothiophene backbone by varying the terminal donor auxiliary such as -NMe2, -NEt2 and -NPh2. The effect of such structural variation on the photophysical and electrochemical properties has been investigated. Computational studies obtained from DFT/TD-DFT calculations were found to be in good correlation with the experimental optoelectronic results. TiO2 based n-type quasi-solid state DSSCs constructed on the synthesized dyes revealed a gradual increase in photovoltaic performance with increase in donor size. The trend in power conversion efficiency (η) was found to be -NPh2 (4.10 %) > -NEt2 (3.44%) > -NMe2 (2.57%). Electrochemical impedence analysis also confirmed the longer electron life time for dye possessing bulky -NPh2 groups in comparision to -NEt2 and -NMe2 groups, thus demonstrating the impact of increased donor size on the DSSC performance. Overall, this paper validates the impact of donor size on the DSSC performance and could inspire the selection of appropriate auxiliary donors to enhance the efficiency in futuristic endeavors."

Herein, thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes were fused in bay-area of naphthalene via six-member-ring connection, resulting in the formation of dihydropyrenobisthieno[3,2-b]thiophene based octacyclic ladder-type donor core, which was flanked by two 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) acceptor motifs with and without 5,6-diflourination, namely PTT-IC and PTT-2FIC, respectively, as novel efficient A-D-A fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Compared with PTT-IC, fluorinated PTT-2FIC possesses narrower optical bandgap of 1.48 eV, better π-π stacking, and its PBDB-T:PTT-2FIC blend film exhibited better morphology, and better hole and electron mobility. As a result, nonfullerene solar cells using PBDB-T:PTT-2FIC as the active layer achieved a decent PCE of 10.40%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.87 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.65, and a much higher short-circuit current (JSC) of 18.26 mA/cm2. Meanwhile, the PBDB-T:PTT-IC cells delivered a lower JSC of 12.58 mA/cm2 but a higher VOC of 0.99 V, thus resulting in a PCE of 7.39% due to its wider optical bandgap of 1.58 eV and higher LUMO energy level. These results demonstrated that NFAs based on fused-ring donor core from fusing thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes with naphthalene via six-member-ring connection are promising for organic photovoltaic applications."
94,94,10.1039/d0tc05697a,,,Long-range exciton diffusion in a non-fullerene acceptor: approaching the incoherent limit,2021,"In organic photovoltaic cells, absorption of light leads to the formation of excitons, which then diffuse to the donor/acceptor interface to generate photocurrent. The distance from which excitons can reach the interface is constrained by the exciton diffusion length, which has been difficult to quantitatively model or predict due to structural and energetic disorder. Modern non-fullerene acceptors have been shown to possess exceptionally large diffusion lengths, along with well-defined molecular and packing structures, suggesting that a predictive framework for materials design and computational screening may be possible. In this work, we demonstrate that the large diffusion coefficient recently observed in an archetypical non-fullerene acceptor, IDIC, can be accurately quantified using density functional theory, and that the low energetic disorder means that the crystal structure provides a meaningful starting point to understand exciton motion in thin films. Accounting for the short- and long-range excitonic interactions, as well as spatiotemporal disorder, we demonstrate that both Monte-Carlo techniques and a simple sum-over-rates method can accurately predict experimental values for exciton diffusivity and diffusion length. The simplicity and accuracy of this approach are directly linked to the structural order of these materials, and an electronic coupling profile that is unusually resilient to thermal distortions – highlighting the potential of the sum-over-rates method for computational materials screening. Moreover, we show that these factors, combined with the low reorganisation energy and significant long-range electronic coupling, lead to diffusion rates that approach the upper limit of incoherent energy transfer and long diffusion lengths that relieve constraints on organic solar cell device architectures."

However, the microscopic photoinduced dynamics at corresponding donor-acceptor interfaces remains unclear. In this work, we have firstly employed state-of-the-art TDDFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations in combination with static electronic structure calculations to explore the ultrafast photoinduced dynamics at a typical nonfullerene donor-acceptor PTB7:PDI interface using a minimal model system (172 atoms). Upon excitation with specific wavelength of light, both PTB7 and PDI can be locally excited to generate |PTB7* and |PDI* excitons due to their high absorption ability and significant overlap in absorption spectrum. After that, these localized excitons gradually convert to charge transfer exciton |PTB7+PDI-, while another |PTB7-PDI+ charge transfer exciton is not involved in the whole process. Along with the exciton conversion, electron transfer from PTB7 to PDI (channel I charge generation) and the hole transfer from PDI to PTB7 (channel II charge generation) occurs simultaneously with time constants of 643 fs and 549 fs respectively. In the same time, D index that measures the centroid distance of electron and hole increases from 1.0 Å to 4.0 Å, which clearly reflects a charge transfer process at the interface. Our present work provides solid evidence that both channel I and channel II charge generation processes play important roles at PTB7:PDI interface, which could be helpful for the design of novel nonfullerene solar cells with better photovoltaic performance."
96,96,10.1039/d0qm00581a,,,Recent progress in reducing voltage loss in organic photovoltaic cells,2021,"Compared with inorganic or perovskite photovoltaic cells, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells often exhibit larger voltage losses, which hinders improvements in their efficiency. The unwanted voltage losses are mainly caused by the driving force for charge generation and non-radiative recombination. In recent years, with the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the voltage losses of OPV cells have been significantly suppressed, contributing to a boost in efficiency. Two aspects help to decrease voltage loss: (1) many OPV cells based on NFAs possess high-efficiency charge generation under aligned energy levels between the donor and acceptor, almost eliminating the driving forces in charge generation; (2) the illumination efficiencies of active layer blends containing NFAs are vastly improved, thus decreasing the non-radiative recombination loss. In this review, we summarize the recent progress achieved in the reduction of voltage losses in OPV cells. First, we present a brief background of voltage loss in different types of photovoltaic cells. Second, we discuss the latest research results, such as the charge generation mechanism under low donor–acceptor energy offsets and how non-radiative loss can be suppressed via tuning the charge transfer state. Finally, we provide insight into the design of highly efficient OPV materials that may be achieved via further decreases in voltage loss."

In this contribution, we investigate the photovoltaic performance of benzodithiophene (BDT)-based p-type small molecules with three different side chains, namely alkyl-thio (BTR-TE), dialkylthienyl (BTR), and trialkylsilyl (BTR-TIPS) moieties substituted on the BDT core, when used alongside a nonfullerene acceptor. The side-chain changes on the BDT core are shown to have a profound effect on energy levels, charge generation, recombination, morphology, and photovoltaic performance of solid-state molecules. Compared with BTR and BTR-TIPS, BTR-TE-based single-junction binary blend solar cells show the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% due to improved morphology and charge transport with suppressed recombination. In addition, we also achieved relatively good performances for ternary blend solar cells with a PCE of 16.1% using BTR-TE as a third component. Our results show that side-chain modification has a significant effect on modulating active layer morphology, and in particular that thioether side-chain modification is an effective way to achieve optimum morphology and performance for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices."

To obtain planar conjugated polymers, low cost small molecular acceptors, and dopant-free hole transport polymers, we adopted intramolecular noncovalent interactions (INCIs) as the design strategy. In this brief review, we will demonstrate that the INCI strategy is very efficient in the design of high performance photovoltaic materials."

Electron spin control is a novel strategy to prolong the CT state lifetime via generation of the 3CT triplet state, instead of the traditional short-lived 1CT state. This method involves a local triplet excited state (3LE) as the precursor of charge separation (CS), and the electron forbidden feature of the charge recombination (CR) of 3CT → S0 vs. the electron spin allowed 1CT → S0 prolongs the CT state lifetime. In this article, we summarized the recent developments and challenges in this emerging fascinating area."
105,105,10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c03595,,,Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Relaxation at a Donor-Acceptor Interface,2021,"The efficiency of charge separation in organic photovoltaic materials is crucially determined by the underlying dynamics of the charge transfer (CT) excitons and their dissociation into free electrons and holes. To unravel the main principles of the underlying mechanism on a molecular level, we construct a toy model of electronically coupled donors interacting with a manifold of CT exciton states. In particular, we set up a ladder of CT site energies to model the exciton dissociation. To mimic the complexity of the exciton dynamics at the donor-acceptor interface, the electronic CT manifold is designed to include two vibrational modes that are vibronically coupled to the excitons. We examine the impact of the electronic and vibrational coherences and the structure of the vibronic manifold on the transfer efficiency and charge recombination. Optimal configurations of the vibronic CT manifold are revealed. In particular, the rate of charge recombination can be minimized when the transient dynamics are carefully explored. Such a toy model can be used as a guide for the design of organic materials for efficient photovoltaic devices."

Morphology, optical and electrochemical properties of active layers as well as electrical properties of polymer solar cells were studied. Furthermore, the photoelectric conversion processes of annealed and unannealed devices were also examined by means of time resolved spectroscopy. The results showed that thermal annealing had a weak influence on the dynamics of exciton states. Besides, annealed device is found to suppress bimolecular recombination owing to its higher charge carrier mobility in ordered donor and acceptor aggregation phases, which led to higher photocurrent and power conversion efficiency than unannealed photovoltaic device."

DFT and TD-DFT methods at the level of B3LYP with a 6–311 G basis set in a gas and chloroform solvent were used to calculate electronic and optoelectronic properties. To dissect the relationship between the molecular and optoelectronic structures, the impacts of specific acceptors on the geometry of molecules and optoelectronic properties of these D–A monomers were discussed. The calculations are also carried out on HOMO–LUMO, atomic orbital densities. The calculated band gap Eg of the monomers considered increases 3,6-MMCB-OCP ≈ 3,6-MMCB-BCO < 3,6-MMCB-SDP < 3,6-MMCB-SCP < 3,6-MMCB-TCP < 3,6-MMCB-TDP < 3,6-MMCB-BCS < 3,6-MMCB-BCT in both in the gas and solvent phases.

109,109,10.1002/cssc.202100799,,,Reducing Non-Radiative Voltage Losses by Methylation of Push–Pull Molecular Donors in Organic Solar Cells,2021,"Organic solar cells are approaching power conversion efficiencies of other thin-film technologies. However, in order to become truly market competitive, the still substantial voltage losses need to be reduced. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of four novel arylamine-based push-pull molecular donors, two of them exhibiting a methyl group at the para position of the external phenyl ring of the arylamine block. By assessing the charge-transfer state properties and the effects of methylation on the open-circuit voltage of the device, we show that devices based on methylated versions of the molecular donors exhibit reduced voltage losses due to decreased non-radiative recombination. Modelling suggests that methylation results in a tighter interaction between donor and acceptor molecules, turning into a larger oscillator strength to the charge-transfer states, thereby ensuing reduced non-radiative decay rates."

Herein, a novel small molecule (SM)-donor, namely FYSM-SiCl, with trialkylsilyl and chlorine substitutions was designed and synthesized. Compared to the original SM-donor FYSM-H, SM-donor FYSM-Si with trialkylsilyl substitution shows a decreased crystallinity and lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, while FYSM-SiCl has an improved crystallinity, more ordered packing arrangement, significantly lower HOMO level, and predominant ""face-on"" orientation. Matched with a SM-acceptor Y6, the FYSM-SiCl-based all-SM OSCs exhibited both high V oc of 0.85 V and high J sc of 23.7 mA cm -2 , which is rare for all-SM OSCs and can be attributed to the low HOMO level of FYSM-SiCl and the delicate balance between high crystallinity and suitable blend morphology. As a result, FYSM-SiCl achieved a high PCE of 13.4% in all-SM OSCs, which is much higher than those of FYSM-H (10.9%) and FYSM-Si (12.2%). This work demonstrated a promising method for the design of efficient SM-donors by a side-chain engineering strategy via the introduction of trialkylsilyl and chlorine substitutions."

In this work, four simple nonfullerene acceptors with an A-D-A'-D-A configuration, QCIC1, QCIC2, QCIC3, and QCIC4, are synthesized. They own the same conjugated backbone (A': quinoxaline; D: cyclopentadithiophene; A: dicyano-indanone) but different halogen atoms and alkyl side chains. Due to the chlorination on the end-groups and the most and/or longest branched alkyl side chains on the backbone, the blended film composed of QCIC3 and donor PBDB-T exhibits the strongest π-π stacking and the most suitable phase-separation domains among the four blended films. Therefore, the QCIC3 based organic solar cells yield the highest power conversion efficiency of 10.55%.

In addition, the introduction of π-extended aromatic frameworks into polymer main chains is a useful strategy to facilitate dense π-π stacking structures with long-range order in the solid-state, thereby enabling efficient carrier transport in organic electronics. However, such highly π-extended aromatic frameworks have rarely been reported due to the need for multiple steps. This focus review describes the synthesis and characterization of D-A polymers based on three π-extended heteropolycyclic aromatic frameworks, using phenanthro[1,2-b:8,7-b’]dithiophene (PDT) as a weak donor and alkoxy-substituted anthra[1,2‑c:5,6‑c’]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (ATz) and vinylene-bridged 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBTzE) as new thiadiazole-based acceptor units. In addition, their applications to organic electronic devices, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), and the detailed relationship between the thin-film structure and device performance in OFETs and OPVs were investigated. These results indicate that these novel π-extended heteropolycyclic aromatic frameworks may serve as building units for the development of wide-bandgap p-type semiconducting polymers for nonfullerene solar cells and low-bandgap n-type semiconducting polymers for OFETs and OPVs.

Yet despite much attention, the effects of π bridges on exciton dissociation dynamics in donor–π–acceptor (D-π-A) alternating conjugated polymers remain still unclear. Here, using a combination of femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and steady-state spectroscopy, we track ultrafast intramolecular exciton relaxation dynamics in three D-π-A alternating conjugated polymers which were synthesized by Qin's group and named HSD-A, HSD-B, HSD-C. It is found that the addition of thiophene unit as π bridges will lead to the red shift of steady-state absorption spectrum. Importantly, we reveal the existence of a new intramolecular exciton dissociation pathway mediated by a bridge-specific charge transfer (CT′) state with the TA fingerprint peak at 1200 nm in π-bridged HSD-B and HSD-C. This CT′ state results in higher electron capture rates for HSD-B and HSD-C as compared to HSD-A. Depending on the proportion of CT′ state and nongeminate recombination are important step for the understanding of high power conversion efficiencies in HSD-B than in HSD-C. We propose that this bridge-specific exciton dissociation pathway plays an important role in ultrafast intramolecular exciton dissociation of organic photovoltaic material D-π-A alternating conjugated polymers."

Here, we investigate a polymer/organic small molecule-blend used as absorber layer in an organic solar cell and employ EELS for distinguishing polymer donor and small molecule acceptor domains in the nanostructured blend based on elemental maps of light elements, such as nitrogen, sulfur or fluorine. Especially for beam sensitive samples, the electron dose needs to be limited, therefore optimized acquisition and data processing strategies are required. We compare data acquired on a post-column energy filter with a direct electron detection camera to data from a conventional CCD camera on the same filter and we investigate the impact of statistical data processing methods (principal components analysis, PCA) on acquired spectra and elemental maps extracted from spectrum images. Our work shows, that the quality of spectra on a direct electron detection camera is far superior to conventional CCD imaging, and thereby allows clear identification of ionization edges and the fine structure of these edges. For the quality of the elemental maps, the application of PCA is essential to allow a clear separation between the donor and acceptor phase in the bulk heterojunction absorber layer of a non-fullerene organic solar cell."

The SMBDT-S and SMBDT-SF donor molecules exhibited excellent thermal stability and high crystallinity. SMBDT-S was found to have a wide bandgap of 1.85 eV with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of − 5.56 eV. The fluorination in SMBDT-SF led to the same bandgap of 1.86 eV with an even lower-lying HOMO energy level of − 5.72 eV. Both SMBDT-S and SMBDT-SF have large thin-film absorption coefficients of (1.4–1.5) × 105 cm−1. Bulk heterojunction OPV devices based on pairing SMBDT-S and SMBDT-SF respectively with PC71BM electron acceptor showed Voc as high as 1.18 eV, which is among the highest Voc reported for all-small-molecule solar cells.

Orientation-dependent effects of IISF donor are clearly observed in the photovoltaic properties of D−π−A type dyes JY70 and JY72, though close power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieves finally owing to the trade-off effect of open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC). By contrast, regioisomeric dyes JY71 and JY73 with an auxiliary diphenylamine donor present a significantly different photovoltaic performance. Under the [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ electrolyte, device based on JY73 gives much higher VOC and JSC, hence a greater PCE (7.40%) which is over two times higher than its regioisomeric JY71 (3.31%). Reasons for that have been systematically investigated.

119,119,10.1016/j.solmat.2020.110765,,,Enhanced lifetime of organic photovoltaic diodes achieved by blending with PMMA: Impact of morphology and Donor:Acceptor combination,2021,"In order to realise the potential of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) to provide cheap, scalable access to renewable energy, it is necessary to improve their lifetime and cost of encapsulation. The aim of this work is to achieve these aims by blending the donor and acceptor with the commodity polymer, PMMA, to form a ternary blend device with enhanced lifetime. We find that ternary OPV devices prepared in this manner can have up to double the lifetime of the binary control devices to an extent that depends upon the PMMA morphology and the processing additives used. Further, we find that the initial performance of ternary OPVs may decrease (in the case of PTB7-based blends) or slightly increase (in the case of P3HT-based blends) when compared to their binary counterparts, which is hypothesised to be due to donor compatibility with the PMMA. These findings suggest that this approach can be employed in other OPV blend systems and give design rules to maximise the positive impact on device lifetime."

Both materials, coded as W5 and W6, were based on the donor–acceptor–donor structural format, where indoline was used as a terminal donor and the naphthalene diimide unit was the central acceptor. Both W5 and W6 were designed to be the structural analogues where a phenyl ring was used as a π-linker in the former, and the latter comprised an additional thiophene ring. The π-linkers were induced between the donor (indoline) and acceptor (naphthalene diimide) functionalities. As a result of adding a thiophene ring in W6, its thin film demonstrated improved light-harvesting properties together with a narrower optical band gap. The photovoltaic properties were evaluated using solution-processed, bulk-heterojunction devices and W6 afforded a promising power conversion efficiency of 6.71% when tested as a donor material together with the conventional acceptor ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)). The efficiency exhibited by W6: PC71BM is approximately 50% higher than the device based on the W5 blend (4.49%).

Based on a polymeric donor PBDBT-2F (PBDBT=Poly [[4,8-bis [5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluoro-2-thienyl]benzo [1,2-b:4,5- b′ ]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl [5,7-bis (2-ethylhexyl)-4,8-dioxo-4 H ,8 H -benzo [1,2- c :4,5- c′ ]dithiophene-1,3-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl]) and a non-fullerene (NF) acceptor Y6, we proposed a strategy to improve the properties of photovoltaic performances in PHJ-based OSCs through dilute dispersions of the PBDBT-2F donor into the acceptor-dominant phase with the sequential film deposition. With the control of donor dispersions, the charge transport balance in the PHJ-OSCs is improved, leading to the expedited photocarrier sweep-out with reduced bimolecular charge recombination. As a result, a PCE of 15.4% is achieved in the PHJ-OSCs. Importantly, the PHJ solar cells with donor dispersions exhibit better thermal stability than corresponding BHJ devices, which is related to the better film morphology robustness and less affected charge sweep-out during the thermal aging."
122,122,10.1021/acsami.0c17049,,,Preaggregation Matching of Donors and Acceptors in Solution Accounting for Thermally Stable Non-Fullerene Solar Cells,2020,"The mechanism of how the solvent type influences photovoltaic performance and thermal stability of non-fullerene organic solar cells remains unexplored. In this article, the well-known PTB7-Th was selected as a donor, while F8IC was used as an acceptor. The PTB7-Th:F8IC processed from chloroform (CF) exhibited a superiorly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.5%, in contrast to the specimen processed from chlorobenzene (CB) of 6.8%. In addition, upon thermal annealing at 160 °C for 120 min, the device processed from CF was more stable than that processed from CB. The incorporation of perylene diimide derivative TBDPDI-C11, serving as the third additive, could also obviously improve the PCE value and thermal stability of PTB7-Th:F8IC processed from CB. According to ultraviolet spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analyses, the enhanced photovoltaic performance and thermal stability are mainly attributed to formation of PTB7-Th nanofibers and appropriate aggregation of F8IC. The interaction free energy calculated using water and diiodomethane contact angles reveals that PTB7-Th well disperses in CB and tends to aggregate in CF, while F8IC aggregates strongly in CB. The preaggregation matching of the donor and acceptor in solution is essential for the optimization of morphology, efficiency, and thermal stability. The findings in this article could provide useful guidelines to fabricate efficient and thermally stable organic solar cells simply by analyzing the surface energy of components processed from different solvents."
123,123,10.1021/acsami.0c16854,,,"Effects on Photovoltaic Characteristics by Organic Bilayer- A nd Bulk-Heterojunctions: Energy Losses, Carrier Recombination and Generation",2020,"We investigate the photovoltaic characteristics of organic solar cells (OSCs) for two distinctly different nanostructures, by comparing the charge carrier dynamics for bilayer- and bulk-heterojunction OSCs. Most interestingly, both architectures exhibit fairly similar power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), reflecting a comparable critical domain size for charge generation and charge recombination. Although this is, at first hand, surprising, a detailed analysis points out the similarity between these two concepts. A bulk-heterojunction architecture arranges the charge generating domains in a 3D ensemble across the whole bulk, while bilayer architectures arrange the specific domains on top of each other, rather than sharp bilayers. Specifically, for the polymer PBDB-T-2F, we find that the enhanced charge generation in a bulk composite is partially compensated by reduced recombination in the bilayer architecture, when nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) are used instead of a fullerene acceptor. Overall, we demonstrate that bilayer-heterojunction OSCs with NFAs can reach competitive PCEs compared to the corresponding bulk-heterojunction OSCs because of reduced nonradiative open-circuit voltage losses, and suppressed trap-assisted recombination, as a result of a vertically separated donor-to-acceptor nanostructure. In contrast, the bilayer-heterojunction OSCs with the fullerene acceptor exhibited poor photovoltaic characteristics compared to the corresponding bulk devices because of highly aggregated acceptor molecules on top of the polymer donor. Although free carrier generation is reduced in a in a bilayer-heterojunction, because of reduced donor/acceptor interfaces and a limited exciton diffusion length, more favorable transport pathways for unipolar charge collection can partially compensate the aforementioned disadvantages. We propose that the unique properties of NFAs may open a technical venue for the bilayer-heterojunction as a great and easy alternative to the bulk heterojunction."

125,125,10.1039/d0ta09351c,,,Enhancing the photovoltaic performance of heteroheptacene-based nonfullerene acceptors through the synergistic effect of side-chain engineering and fluorination,2020,"As two essential components of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type nonfullerene acceptors, both end-groups and side-chains can affect the performance of the resulting nonfullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, two new nonfullerene acceptors, namely M1 and M4, are developed to investigate the synergistic effect of side-chains and end-groups on the photovoltaic properties of nonfullerene acceptors. Compared with M1 with nonfluorinated end-groups and shorter side-chains, M4 exhibits a red-shifted absorption, lowered energy levels, more ordered molecular packing and increased crystallinity due to its longer side-chains as well as fluorinated end-groups. Moreover, when blended with the polymer donor of PM6, the M4-based blend shows an enhanced face-on molecular orientation and more favorable phase separation in comparison with the M1-based counterpart thereby leading to increased charge carrier mobilities and decreased charge recombination for the PSCs based on M4. As a consequence, a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.75% with an increased short-circuit current density of 23.44 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 71.52% is achieved for the M4-based devices outperforming that of the M1-based devices (PCE = 8.06%). This study provides an important strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of nonfullerene acceptors."

In solution, these highly TCBD-twisted systems showed a strong internal charge transfer band in the visible spectrum and no detectable photoluminescence (PL). Photophysical and theoretical investigations revealed very short singlet excited state deactivation time of ~ 10 ps resulting from significant conformational changes of the TCBD-arene moiety upon photoexcitation, opening a pathway for non-radiative decay. The PL was recovered in vacuum-processed films or when the molecules were dispersed in a PMMA matrix leading to a significant increase of the excited state deactivation time. As shown by cyclic voltammetry, these molecules can act as electron-donors compared to C60 . Hence, vacuum-processed planar heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated leading to a maximum power conversion efficiency of ca . 1.9% which decreases with the increase of the arene size."
127,127,10.1039/d0ta09306h,,,Isomeric effects of chlorinated end groups on efficient solar conversion,2020,"Isomers with subtle differences in their molecular structure often exhibit different electronic/optoelectronic properties, charge-transport behaviors and photovoltaic performances. In this work, we describe BTIC-2Cl-γ, BTIC-2Cl-δ, and BTIC-2Cl-β, three isomers with acceptor–donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A–D–A) structures, in which a fused benzothiadiazole is the donor (D) unit and a single chlorine atom substituted at the δ, β or γ position of the benzene-fused end groups is the acceptor (A) unit. In general, changes in the position of the chlorine atom were found to lead to significantly different absorptions, energy levels, and photovoltaic performances. Compared to BTIC-2Cl-δ, the BTIC-2Cl-γ isomer shows similar UV/Vis absorption, energy levels, and molecular packing, but slightly better photovoltaic performance. A crystallographic analysis of BTIC-2Cl-δ indicates that the molecules easily form a three-dimensional (3D) network due to the noncovalent interactions of Cl⋯S, Cl⋯π and Cl⋯N. When blended with PBDB-TF as an electron-donor material, the devices based on BTIC-2Cl-γ exhibited higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 15.04% with an increased voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, which was better than that of BTIC-2Cl-δ-based devices (14.13%) and much higher than that of BTIC-2Cl-β-based devices (7.39%). Our studies demonstrate that having the chlorine atom at the different positions of the end groups clearly affects the photovoltaic properties of the resulting acceptors."
128,128,10.1039/d0cp05478j,,,Ultrafast spectroscopy on water-processable PCBM: Rod-coil block copolymer nanoparticles,2020,"Using ultrafast spectroscopy, we investigate the photophysics of water-processable nanoparticles composed of a block copolymer electron donor and a fullerene derivative electron acceptor. The block copolymers are based on a poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b']dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] rod, which is covalently linked with 2 or 100 hydrophilic coil units. In both samples the photogenerated excitons in the blend nanoparticles migrate in tens of ps to a donor/acceptor interface to be separated into free charges. However, transient absorption spectroscopy indicates that increasing the coil length from 2 to 100 units results in the formation of long living charge transfer states which reduce the charge generation efficiency. Our results shed light on the impact of rod-coil copolymer coil length on the blend nanoparticle morphology and provide essential information for the design of amphiphilic rod-coil block copolymers to increase the photovoltaic performances of water-processable organic solar cell active layers."

Because the factor of chemical modifications is precluded, polymorphisms featuring different packing motifs of the same molecular structures provide an ideal platform for revealing the influence of solid-state packing. Herein, we have calculated the Eb values in three different cystal phases of a representative acceptor-donor-acceptor molecular acceptor (IDIC) by the self-consistent quantum mechanics/embedded charge approach. The results show that the differences of mere molecular packing modes can result in a substantial change in Eb of ≤50%, in the range of 0.21-0.34 eV among the three IDIC crystal phases. Moreover, a higher backbone packing dimensionality is found to be beneficial for obtaining a smaller Eb. This indicates that polymorph engineering is an effective way to reduce Eb toward low-energy-loss organic solar cells."

Synthesis of the star copolymer, G1PPT-co-PEDOT was confirmed by spectroscopic studies. Indeed, the disappearance of the very high intensity bands, C–H bending at α-position (687 cm−1), and C=N stretching (1620 cm−1) in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of G1PPT-co-PEDOT, which were initially present in the spectrum of the thiolated starting material, G1PPT, confirmed copolymerization. Furthermore, a large bathochromic shift in the onset wavelength of the UV-Vis absorbance spectra from 367 nm in G1PPT to 674 nm in G1PPT-co-PEDOT further attests of successful copolymerization. The electrochemical analysis of G1PPT-co-PEDOT achieved a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level value of 5.3 eV, which is reminiscent of the value for an ideal electron-donor material. Photoluminescence quenching of up to 82% was observed in solution blends of the G1PPT-co-PEDOT star copolymer and N,N′-diisopropyl naphthalene diimide (NDI). This demonstrates the occurrence of photoinduced intermolecular charge transfer (PICT) from the electron-donating G1PPT-co-PEDOT to the electron accepting NDI, a good property, beneficial for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications."

A comparative photophysical analysis (including absorption spectra, exciton diffusion lengths, singlet and triplet charge transfer dynamics and so on) of PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7Ir/PC71BM cell devices was investigated, by DFT and TD-DFT methods, to explore why PTB7Ir/PC71BM device has obvious higher PCE (8.71%) than PTB7/PC71BM device (6.64%) in the same condition. The results manifest that the enhanced PCE of the PTB7Ir/PC71BM device is mainly attributed to the improving exciton diffusion lengths owing to the longer lifetime and increasing diffusivity of triplet excitons. Besides, to reveal the structure-property relationships of the polymer donor materials, we calculated the values of driving force for charge recombination to the triplet (CRT) with the changes of torsional angles between electron donating and electron withdrawing units of PTB7 and PTB7Ir. It is found that suitably increasing the angle and number of torsional angles of polymer donors to limit conjugation extent will prevent the CRT process at donor/acceptor interface and thus improve photovoltaic performance. This work would provide theoretical guidelines for the molecular design of high-efficiency triplet-material-based OPVs."

The optimal device yields a PCE of 6.47% with a VOC of 0.64 V, a FF of 55.5% and a high JSC of 18.18 mA cm−2, which may be attributed to the complementary optical absorption of active blend (P3 and ITIC-3T).

A series of acceptor-π-donor-π-acceptor (A-π-D-π-A) type small-molecule donor (SMD) materials for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells with PC71BM as electron acceptor have been designed and synthesized. Three novel small molecules are denoted as flu(3TRD)2, flu(3TCN)2 and flu(3TIN)2, with dioctyl-substituted fluorene as core, 3,3″-dioctyl-2,2':5′,2″-terthiophene as π-bridge, terminated by rhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indanedione, respectively. Improvements of photovoltaic performance have been successfully realized via tuning terminal electron-withdrawing units. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices as-cast prepared from flu(3TRD)2, flu(3TCN)2 and flu(3TIN)2 increases in turn, which is ascribed to incremental optical absorption thereby promoting short-circuit current density (JSC). Particularly, flu(3TCN)2 shows deeper LUMO and HOMO energy levels than flu(3TRD)2 and flu(3TIN)2 due to the strong electron-withdrawing character of malononitrile. As expected, the device as-cast based on flu(3TCN)2 exhibits a reasonable high VOC of 1.07 V. In addition, a satisfactory PCE of 7.06% has been obtained for flu(3TCN)2 based device with dichloromethane vapor treatment."

Diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP1), a well known electron acceptor moiety and its regioisomer diketopyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole (DPP2) are coupled with various electron donor groups containing fused ring system to obtain model compounds of D-A-D type of architecture. The donor groups include meta-benzodithiophene, ortho-benzodithiophene, carbazole, dithienopyrrole, dithienosilole and dithienothiophene. An analysis of their properties reveal that these compounds possess unique characteristics and advantages over each other. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the DPP2-based compounds exhibit lower hole reorganization energy (λh) than the corresponding DPP1-based compounds, while the DPP1-based compounds have lower electron reorganization energy (λe) than the corresponding DPP2-based compounds, which is in line with the observed ionizational potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) values. The calculated open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) values of the DPP2-based compounds as donors with fullerene-like PC61BM as an acceptor are higher than the DPP1-based compounds as donors. Charge density difference (CDD) calculation shows DPP2 based compounds exhibit better intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties as compared to their DPP1 counterpart. The weaker electron-hole coherence may lead to easy exciton dissociation in case of DPP1-based compounds at donor/acceptor interface, which is also supported by their comparatively lower exciton binding energy as compared to DPP2 counterparts."

The reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), based on high performance light-harvesting materials, have been close to the requirement of practical application. However, scaling up and processability of the materials have become one of the main barriers inhibiting the OPV commercialization. In order to provide ideas for solving the cost issue, a series of low-cost p-type copolymers, PTV-X (X represents different alkyl side chains) with copolymerization of thienylene and vinylene as backbones, are prepared and characterized. It was demonstrated that PTV-based materials possess almost flat structure and broad absorption spectra range from 300 to 750 nm. Besides, the hole mobilities of the optimized materials are up to magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Importantly, the PTV-X family polymers can work effectively with various representative fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. A regioregular polymer, namely PTVT-C12, is synthesized based on monomers of (thiophene-vinylene-thiophene) TVT-C12 and V–Sn to further modulate the morphological properties of the PTV-series polymers. The more ordered chain packing was observed in PTVT-C12 film and enhanced charge carrier mobility was realized in PTVT-C12 based OSC device. As a result, a PCE of 6.44% is exhibited by the device based on PTVT-C12: BO-4Cl. This study suggests that PTV-series materials are being worthy of consideration for the development of low-cost materials for the future OPV commercialization."

Unfortunately, it is always hard to measure and explore the morphology and electronic structure at the interface experimentally. In this paper, subazaphenalenephthalocyanine (subAPPC), a derivative of popular boron subphthalocyanine chloride (subPC) with a core-expanded six-membered ring, is selected to pair with C60 fullerene. The purpose is to explore how the molecular arrangements at donor-acceptor interface influence the optoelectronic properties of this new OSC and to test whether this new solar cell is superior to popular subPC/C60 solar cell because subAPPC seems to have great potential. Then, by modeling five configurations (B/U stands for C60 on/in the convex/concave of subAPPC, respectively), the calculated results of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT show that different molecular orientations have significant effects on interfacial photovoltaic properties such as absorption spectrum, open circuit voltage, and exciton binding energy. Finally, new subAPPC/C60 solar cell may be superior to prototype subPC/C60 because simulated absorption is enhanced and predicted VOC could be higher at the interface of B configurations. However, in U configuration, subAPPC/C60 has a very low VOC, which suggest that U configuration should be prevented during fabrication process of this new solar cell."

PPyQxff and PPyQx were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV−VIS absorption, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. PPyQxff and PPyQx revealed excellent solution processability in common organic solvents. PPyQxff and PPyQx presented decomposition temperatures above 300 °C. The inclusion of F atoms to the quinoxaline moiety made a slight reduction in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, relative to the unfluorinated polymer, but had no impact on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. PPyQxff and PPyQx exhibited similar physical properties with strong and broad absorbance from 400 to 700 nm and an optical band-gap energy of 1.77 eV.

148,148,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105161,,,Multiple conformation locks gift polymer donor high efficiency,2020,"Abstract The mechanism that how noncovalent conformation locks (NCLs) to improve the photovoltaic performance of polymer donors was investigated. By developing a model system with three structure-related copolymers W1, W2 and W3, a clear correlation was found between the locking strength in polymer backbone and the photovoltaic performance. W1 with the strongest S⋅⋅⋅O and F⋅⋅⋅H double-side locking gave the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.23%, while W2 with a S⋅⋅⋅O single-side locking and W3 with a weakened S⋅⋅⋅O locking caused by Cl–H steric repulsion gave lower PCEs of 11.73% and 0.92%, respectively. With the aid of single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, density functional theory calculation, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis, atomic force microscope study and device characterization, the functions of NCLs in improving the planarity, packing, crystallinity and hole mobility of polymers, as well as the morphology of blend films, were illuminated in detail."
149,149,10.1039/d0ta07996k,,,Multi-channel exciton dissociation in D18/Y6 complexes for high-efficiency organic photovoltaics,2020,"Interfacial charge transfer between the donor and acceptor plays a crucial role in determining the photo-induced charge generation mechanisms and efficiencies for organic solar cells. Here, we have theoretically investigated the exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination processes in complexes consisting of a wide-bandgap polymer donor D18 and a narrow-bandgap small-molecule acceptor Y6, which exhibit the best organic photovoltaic performance to date. The results show that besides the lowest charge-transfer (CT0) state, there are also four higher-lying CT states below the lowest singlet excited state (S1) of D18, and the excitons on D18 will dissociate into the higher-lying CT states much faster (1010–1012 s−1) than into the CT0 state (107–108 s−1). In contrast, only the CT0 state is below the S1 state of Y6 due to the small driving force for hole transfer from Y6 to D18, while the dissociation rates of Y6 excitons into the CT0 state can be very high (1013 s−1). Importantly, the rates of charge recombination are mostly lower than 106 s−1. These results are fully consistent with the highly efficient exciton dissociation and low charge recombination observed by experiments. Our work underlines the importance of multi-channel exciton dissociation for high-efficiency organic photovoltaics."
150,150,10.1063/5.0022262,,,Morphological and optical properties of α - And β -phase zinc (≥) phthalocyanine thin films for application to organic photovoltaic cells,2020,"We have investigated the morphological and optical properties of α- and β-phase Zinc Phthalocyanine (ZnPc) thin films for application to organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). It was found that the α-phase is completely converted to the β-phase by thermal annealing at 220 °C under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. When the α- to β-phase transition takes place, the surface roughness of the ZnPc film became flat uniformly with a nanometer order of unevenness by anisotropic growth of crystalline grains along a lateral direction to substrates. Correspondingly, the optical absorbance of the β-phase film became greater by 1.5-2 times than that of the α-phase one in an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) wavelength range, which plays a role in increasing the number of photogenerated excitons. On the contrary, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements showed that the average lifetime of excitons for the β-phase film became shorter by 1/6-1/7 than that for the α-phase one, which plays a role in decreasing the number of excitons achieving the donor/acceptor interface where excitons are separated to carriers (holes and electrons). Both the increase in the number and the shortening in the average lifetime have a trade-off relationship with each other for contribution to the photoelectric conversion efficiency of OPVs. Then, we examined an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OPVs using the α- and β-phase films as a donor and obtained that the former OPV (α-phase) exhibits a higher EQE by ∼2 times than the latter one (β-phase) in the wavelength range of 400 nm-800 nm."

Interestingly, the polymer exhibited a strong absorption band from 500 to 650 nm, which overlapped well with the emission spectrum of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) used as an indoor light source. The P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films had a relatively smooth surface and internal morphology compared to the blend films of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T). In particular, the Kelvin probe force microscopy data explained the increased uniformity in the distribution of the surface charge in the annealed P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) films as compared to those of the annealed blend films of P(BDBT) and P(NDI2T). Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) produced by using the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) synthesized in this study as an active layer showed a high power conversion efficiency of 12.70% (@500 lux) with a short circuit current density of 49.89 μA cm−2. The PCE of the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) film-based IPVs was twice as high as that of the blend film-based IPVs and showed excellent operational stability. This study is the first time that the P(BDBT-co-NDI2T) has been applied in IPVs, which suggests the potential for their widespread use in the development of indoor organic PVs in the future."
152,152,10.1109/LED.2020.3016940,,,Study on the characteristics of photovoltaic and field effect of small molecule donors,2020,"Two benzothiadiazole (BT) small molecule donors (namely D1 and D2) were designed and synthesized. We studied their photovoltaics properties and filed effect properties. It is found that the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the organic solar cells (OSCs) was 6.87% based on the D2: IDIC-4F (the donor/acceptor(D/A) ratio is 1:1). In contrast, the device of D1: IDIC-4F (the D/A ratio is 1:1) only shows PCE value of 2.41%. This is because that the crystallization property of the material is improved by the changing of side chain group, which is beneficial to the improvement of the morphology of the donor material. Moreover, the introduction of side chain greatly improves the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of D2 based solar cell. Also, we fabricated the organic field effect transistors (OFETs) with D1 and D2 as semiconductor layer, and n-octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), as a result, the hole motilities of the devices are <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${1.21}\times {10} ^{-{2}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> cm<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{{2}}\text{v}^{-{1}}\text{s}^{-{1}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for D1 and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${1.25}\times {10} ^{-{2}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>cm<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{{2}}\text{v}^{-{1}}\text{s}^{-{1}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for D2, respectively."

This polymer has a lower highest occupied molecular orbital than its non-fluorinated analogue polymer. Organic thin film transistors based on this polymer showed p-type charge transport behavior and a hole mobility of 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1 in bottom-gate bottom-contact devices. Organic solar cells using this polymer as donor and [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester as acceptor achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.4% with a high fill factor of 69%. Our morphology analysis showed that there was a lack of long-range ordered structure in the neat polymer thin film, which could cause the inferior device performance."
155,155,10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.108577,,,The effect of halogenation on PBDTT-TQxT based non-fullerene polymer solar cells – Chlorination vs fluorination,2020,"Abstract The rapid advancement in the development of non-fullerene acceptors has led to single-junction polymer solar cells with efficiencies over 18%. Even with these novel acceptor materials, the choice of the donor polymer remains important. Tuning of the donor and acceptor compatibility in terms of absorption, frontier orbital energy levels, mixing enthalpy and charge carrier mobility is routinely performed by side chain variation. Fluorination presents an additional powerful approach to optimize these parameters. Although significantly less studied, chlorination can give rise to similar effects, while donor-acceptor phase separation due to fluorophobic interactions is less of an issue. Moreover, from a material synthesis point of view, the introduction of chlorine groups is in many cases much more straightforward. In this work, we present a series of push-pull type benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-alt-quinoxaline donor polymers and compare the behavior of the non-halogenated, fluorinated and chlorinated derivatives in polymer solar cells when combined with small molecule and polymer type non-fullerene acceptors. The solar cell efficiencies vary from 2.4 to 8.4%, elucidating the large impact of these small structural variations. Best results are achieved for the chlorinated donor polymer, affording a high open-circuit voltage, balanced charge carrier mobilities and favorable donor-acceptor interactions. Combined with the easier synthesis of chlorinated materials, this suggests that more emphasis should be put on chlorination as a valuable approach to tune the properties of organic semiconductors for solar cell blends (and other optoelectronic applications)."
156,156,10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.108523,,,"Star-shaped benzotriindole-based donor-acceptor molecules: Synthesis, properties and application in bulk heterojunction and single-material organic solar cells",2020,"Abstract The search of the novel building blocks for π-conjugated donor-acceptor (D-π-A) molecules remains an urgent task to design promising materials for organic solar cells (OSCs) and other electronic devices. Here we report on the design and synthesis of two star-shaped D-π-A small molecules based on benzotriidole (BTI) electron-donating core, BTI(2T-DCV-Hex)3 and BTI(2T-CNA-EHex)3, end-capped with either hexyldicyanovinyl or 2-ethylhexylcyanoacetate acceptor groups. Comprehensive investigation and comparison of the optical, thermal and physicochemical properties of these molecules and their analogue with the triphenylamine (TPA) core, N(Ph-2T-DCV-Hex)3, revealed the effect of the electron-withdrawing groups and type of the donor core on their properties. The BTI-based material BTI(2T-DCV-Hex)3 differs from the amorphous TPA-based analogue by high crystallinity and blue-shifted absorption and luminescence spectra. The change of electron-withdrawing group from hexyldicyanovinyl to 2-ethylhexylcyanoacetate leads to a higher energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, lower solubility and several times higher photoluminescence quantum yield in solutions achieving 67%. Evaluation of the photovoltaic performance of these materials in single-material OSCs and as a donor material in bulk heterojunction OSCs with PC71BM as an acceptor revealed that the devices based on BTI(2T-DCV-Hex)3 are more efficient as compared to those based on BTI(2T-CNA-EHex)3. In comparison to N(Ph-2T-DCV-Hex)3, the photovoltaic devices based on BTI(2T-DCV-Hex)3 showed the comparable performance in bulk heterojunction OSCs and two times higher performance (about 1%) in single-material OSCs. As a result, we conclude that the BTI core is a promising block for the design of semiconducting materials for organic photovoltaics and other related applications."
157,157,10.1016/j.dyepig.2020.108524,,,"Hyperbranched conjugated polymers based on 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole for ternary organic solar cells",2020,"Abstract A new class of end-modifiable hyperbranched conjugated polymer (HBCP–Br) was synthesized from an AB2 monomer, and the end-modification of HBCP-Br was carried out by substituting the end-Br with a donor group to give the end-modified HBCPs (HBCP-OR). Both polymers had relatively good thermal stability (Td > 350 °C) and deep HOMO energy levels (−5.40 eV for HBCP-OR, −5.45 eV for HBCP-Br). Besides, the other two similar small molecular acceptors (IDTOTZ and IDTCPT) were synthesized to construct ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) with HBCP-OR or HBCP-Br. Owing to the favorable spectral and energy levels matching and relatively regular morphology, the ternary OSCs based on HBCP-OR/IDTOTZ/IDTCPT obtained an optimized PCE of 4.86% (with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.893 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 11.71 mA, and a fill factor (FF) of 45.18%), which performed better than the devices based on HBCP-Br/IDTOTZ/IDTCPT with a PCE of 2.33%. In addition, the HBCP-Br also exhibited photovoltaic activity when used as acceptors in the ternary OSCs based on small molecular donors, which demonstrated that HBCPs could play different roles in the OSCs."

159,159,10.1039/d0nj02199g,,,On the relations between backbone thiophene functionalization and charge carrier mobility of A-D-A type small molecules,2020,"Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) has been increased rapidly owing to the introduction of a non-fullerene A–D–A type small-molecule acceptor. Thiophene is often used in A–D–A type small molecules as a conjugated bridge between the donor and acceptor parts in the backbone and to widen the intrachain conjugated length. Hence, by functionalizing the thiophenes with different groups, the photoelectric properties of A–D–A types of molecules can be further adjusted. However, there are few reports on the relations between backbone thiophene functionalization of A–D–A type small molecules and charge carrier mobility, which is important to further improve the performance of OPVs. By taking a small A–D–A type of molecule DCC3T as an example, we have functionalized the backbone thiophenes of DCC3T with different groups and modeled a series of small molecules DCC3T-X (X = H, CH3, CHCH2, OCH3, OH, NH2). The molecular packing and charge carrier mobility are studied by using reliable calculations of density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and Marcus theory. The outcomes show that the electron and hole mobilities are exceedingly different among DCC3T-Xs. We find that the differences of charge carrier mobility can mainly be attributed to the change of molecular planarity and electronic structure, which significantly influence reorganization energy, molecular packing, and charge transfer integral. In addition, evident selective transportation phenomenon has been found in the modified DCC3T-Xs. The most striking finding is that functionalizing the backbone thiophenes with the oxygen-containing group –OCH3 could be a promising way to further improve the electron mobility of A–D–A type acceptors."

TQO was copolymerized with 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) to give PBDT-TQO. Thieno[3,2-c]isoquinolin-5(4H)-one (TIQO), an isomeric structure of TQO, was also synthesized to give PBDT-TIQO. The absorption regions of both polymers cover 300–600 nm, complementary to those of well-known non-fullerene acceptors (ITIC or IT-4F). PBDT-TQO exhibited a slightly wider bandgap and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level than PBDT-TIQO, owing to the different intra-molecular charge transfer characteristics. Photovoltaic devices fabricated using PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO donors with a fullerene acceptor (PC71BM) showed the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.02 and 3.92%, respectively, while those using the non-fullerene acceptors (ITIC or IT-4F) showed much higher PCEs. The device using PBDT-TQO:IT-4F showed the highest PCE of 7.62%, with a short-circuit current of 14.44 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.90 V, and a fill factor of 58.92%."

Herein, we designed and synthesized two nitro substituted end groups, N1 and N2. Using the two end groups as A units, two A-D-A type acceptors, F-N1 and F-N2, were obtained. It also has been found that the nitro substitution position on end groups affect not only the absorptions and energy levels of the resultant acceptor materials, but also their molecular packing behavior and active layer morphologies. In addition, the devices based on the two acceptors showed different energy loss. PCEs of 10.66% and 11.86% were achieved for F-N1 and F-N2-based devices, respectively. This work reveals that the nitration of end groups is one of potential strategies for design of high-performance photovoltaic active layer materials."

Despite the countless number of dyes developed, structure-property analysis by varying chromophores and their topology in dyes is useful to formulate design principles. Herein, we report six new organic dyes featuring dithienopyrrole (DTP), benzothiadiazole (BTD) and cyanoacrylic acid units. The effect of auxiliary donors such as triphenylamine or diphenylaminofluorene and the position of benzothiadiazole on the optical and photovoltaic properties were evaluated by appropriate design of dyes. Incorporation of additional donor enhanced the spectral response of the dyes by elongating the conjugation length and supplementing the donor-acceptor interaction. Moving the BTD unit from the position between DTP and acceptor (D-D-A-π-A) to a position between the auxiliary donor and DTP (D-A-D-A) altered the absorption as well as electrochemical properties. Theoretical calculations revealed that the later molecular configuration ensures sufficient overlap of HOMO and LUMO and facilitate the charge transfer propensity from arylamine donor to acceptor which is beneficial for light harvesting. Among the dyes, a D-A-D-A dye possessing triphenylamine exhibited highest power conversion efficiency (η = 7.57%). The structure-property relationship is supported by electron transfer kinetics elucidated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies. The best performing dye displayed high charge recombination and sufficiently low charge transfer resistance in the device."

Various parameters like frontier molecular orbital (FMO), density of states (DOS), transition density matrix (TDM) analysis, absorption maxima, reorganization energies of electron and hole, open circuit voltage (Voc), photophysical characteristics and charge transfer analysis have been estimated in order to understand the performance of newly designed molecules. End caped acceptors modification causes narrowing of HOMO-LUMO energy gap (2.99–3.33 eV) as compared to R (4.04 eV). All designed molecules exhibited absorption spectrum in the range of 334–370 nm in solvent phase and 324–403 nm in gas phase. T1-T6 show maximum charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO orbital which plays a key role in conductive materials. Dipole moment value of designed molecules in ground and excited states are found to be larger than reference molecule which suggested that our designed molecules have more solubility in organic solvent as compared to reference molecule. All designed molecules show better reorganizational energy of electron (0.0191–0.0273 Eh) and hole (0.0063–0.0187Eh). Among designed molecules T3 has lowest reorganizational energy of electron which means that it has highest charge mobility. The Voc with respect to HOMOdonor-LUMOPC61BM shows that designed molecules [T1-T6 (Voc = 1.08–1.50 V)] have better Voc as compared to R (Voc = 0.73 V). This theoretical framework proves that conceptualized molecules are superior and thus are recommended for the future construction of high performance organic solar cells."
164,164,10.1039/d0tc02030c,,,Bimolecular crystal instability and morphology of bulk heterojunction blends in organic and perovskite solar cells,2020,"The performance of polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is significantly influenced by the morphology of electron donor and acceptor blends under the premise that electronic structure is complimentary regarding donor and acceptor materials. There are many cases where intimate mixing of donor and acceptor perturbs the electronic structure, which fundamentally changes the transport and photovoltaic characteristics. Here, we present the bimolecular crystal packing of polymers and fullerenes, and investigate the correlation between device performance and structural details. We find that bimolecular crystallization can reorganize polymer chain packing, leading to poor electron transport and device performance. The size compatibility and the passivation of entropy penalty led to cocrystallization instability, which was clearly seen by in situ GIWAXS data. PC61BM is found to intercalate into side chains of PQT by reorganizing both PQT and PC61BM, forming stable, highly ordered bimolecular crystals. The poor electron transport in bimolecular crystal domain could account for the poor device performance in both perovskite and organic solar cells. Bis-PC61BM, on the other hand, only forms loosely packed aggregates in solution, and then rapidly phase separated into large domains with an edge-on interfacial orientation and performed poorly in solar cells."

In this study, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) where a heteronanographene central core was furnished with branched alkoxy chains of different lengths, TACIC-EH, TACIC-BO, and TACIC-HD, were prepared to adjust the aggregation tendency and systematically probe the relationships of film structures with photophysical and photovoltaic properties. The side-chain length showed negligible effects on the absorption properties and energy levels of TACICs. In addition, regardless of the chain length, all TACIC films exhibited characteristically long singlet exciton lifetimes (1330-2330 ps) compared to those in solution (≤220 ps). Using a conjugated polymer donor, PBDB-T, the best OPV performance was achieved with TACIC-BO that contained medium-length chains, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.92%. TACIC-HD with the longest chains showed deteriorated electron mobility due to the long insulating alkoxy groups. Therefore, the PBDB-T:TACIC-HD-based device revealed a low charge collection efficiency and PCE (8.21%) relative to the PBDB-T:TACIC-BO-based device, but their film morphologies were analogous. Meanwhile, TACIC-EH with the shortest chains showed low solubility and formed micrometer-sized large aggregates in the blend film with PBDB-T. Although the charge collection efficiency of PBDB-T:TACIC-EH was lower than that of PBDB-T:TACIC-BO, the efficiencies of exciton diffusion to the donor-acceptor interface were sufficiently high (>98%) owing to the elongated singlet exciton lifetime of TACIC-EH. The PCE of the PBDB-T:TACIC-EH-based device remained moderate (7.10%). Therefore, TACICs with the long singlet exciton lifetimes in the films provide a clear guideline for NFAs with low sensitivity of OPV device performance to the blend film structures, which is advantageous for large-scale OPV production with high reproducibility."

Herein, to modulate the phase separation morphology so as to enhance the PCE in P3HT-based OSCs, a new NFA, namely ZY-4Cl, is designed and synthesized by modifying the cyano-substituted end groups in BTP-4Cl. The P3HT:ZY-4Cl based OSC exhibits a significantly improved PCE of ∼9.5%, which is a new record for the P3HT-based OSCs. Furthermore, two model compounds, TT-CN and TT-O, are synthesized to simulate the end groups of BTP-4Cl and ZY-4Cl, respectively. The calculated Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, the DSC and the AFM results clearly indicate that the cyano-substituted compound TT-CN shows much stronger miscibility with P3HT compared to TT-O, the one without cyano groups. This molecular design strategy is also verified in the other two representative NFAs. Therefore, this work not only reports an NFA with a high PCE for P3HT-based OSCs, but also suggests guidance for the molecular design of NFAs from the aspect of morphology control."

In this contribution, we report a new WBG polymer donor, PBDT-2FBnT, based on alternative benzodithiophene as the donor unit and 2,5-difluoro benzene (2FBn) as the acceptor unit, which was prepared by a facile three-step process with an overall yield over 80% using cheap raw materials. Benefitting from the incorporation of an electron-deficient 2FBn unit, PBDT-2FBnT demonstrated lower frontier energy levels with an optical bandgap of 2.12 eV. Additionally, the combination of 2FBn with an adjacent two thiophene bridge in the polymer backbone significantly minimized the steric hindrance via non-covalent F···S and C H···F inter/intramolecular interactions, thereby promoting highly coplanar geometry for effective molecular packing and charge transport. Consequently, optimized blends of PBDT-2FBnT with an ITIC acceptor delivered complementary panchromatic absorption, well-aligned energy levels, higher charge carrier mobilities, and well-distributed nano-fibrillar morphology, thereby leading to a remarkable efficiency of 9.5% with a good trade-off between corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Thus, the high photovoltaic performance of PBDT-2FBnT together with simple preparation can provide a promising way for the future development of low-cost PSCs, and we can foresee further PCE improvements of the PBDT-2FBnT structure via synergistic variation of donor and acceptor material."

With the strong electron-donating capability of the backbone D unit, ITOT-4Cl shows a narrow band gap of 1.28 eV, and has an efficient absorption in near-infrared region up to 968 nm. The photovoltaic devices based on PBDB-T:ITOT-4Cl give a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.50%, with a high short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.89 mA cm−2. With F–Br as the third component, the ternary organic solar cells device shows an enhanced PCE of 14.29% with an improved Jsc of 24.40 mA cm−2, which is among the best results for oxygen heterocycle fused nonfullerene acceptor based devices."

The structure of solvent-cast active layers is a result of phase separation in mixtures of donor and acceptor components. To a large extent, this process depends on the interactions between the components of the mixture. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the morphology of poly[ N -9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole- alt -5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71 -butyricacid methyl ester (PC70BM) films in terms of the ternary phase diagram. The interaction parameters between PCDTBT and four different solvents, namely chloroform, chlorobenzene, o -dichlorobenzene, and toluene, were estimated based on swelling experiments. Based on these values, ternary phase diagrams of PCDTBT:PC70BM in different solvents were calculated. The morphology of spin-coated films with different blend ratios cast from different solvents is discussed in terms of the obtained phase diagrams."

Specifically, the star-shaped molecule Tris[4-(2-thienyl)phenyl]amine (C30H21NS3) is considered as donor in combination with the C70 fullerene, as acceptor. The electron transfer induced by Gaussian pulses is investigated for several donor-acceptor configurations, with the electronic states described in the framework of a quantum time evolution formalism based on the Cayley propagator. The electron transfer is correlated with the geometric/electronic features of the complexes, as well as the pulse parameters, suggesting optimal setups for practical realizations."

Alkyl chains with different lengths are incorporated in the indenothienothiophene-based unfused core to ensure the good solubility of the resulting nonfullerene acceptors (n-octyl for ITOTC, n-undecyl for ITUTC and ITUIC), and to tune their charge transporting properties as well. Photovoltaic properties of these nonfullerene acceptors are investigated by using a typical wide band-gap polymer of PBDB-T as the donor material. The best-performance polymer solar cell based on ITOTC: PBDB-T with annealing shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.35%, in comparison with the counterpart based on ITUTC:PBDB-T which shows a PCE of 7.68%. However, 7.68% PCE is higher than that of the best-performance PSC based on ITUIC:PBDB-T (6.45% PCE). These results suggest that both side-chains and electron-deficient terminal groups can be optimized to improve the photovoltaic properties of A-D-A type nonfullerene acceptors based on the indenothienothiophene-based unfused core."

The orthogonal molecular structure of the m-OEh-substituted spirobifluorene with different end groups provided high solubility and kept the stable morphology between donor-acceptor. Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) device performance was not significantly affected by switching the processing solvent from a chlorinated solvent to an environmentally benign solvent, because suitable morphology and crystallinity were retained. The ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:spiro-bridged NFA/MoOx/Ag OPV devices prepared using a chlorobenzene as the processing solvent displayed maximum efficiency in the range of 6.44–5.78%, while the devices made using xylene as the processing solvent had a lower maximum efficiency ranging from 6.14–4.66%. The OPV performance of the devices made using chlorobenzene decreased in the order of sp-mOEh-ITIC > sp-mOEh-ITIC-M > sp-mOEh-ITIC-F > sp-mOEh-ITIC-Cl because an electron donating end group increased open-circuit voltage (Voc), while the electron withdrawing end group increased the short-circuit current density (Jsc). Although the OPV performance of the four spiro-bridged derivatives by xylene was showed to be similar order of that by chlorobenzene solvent processing, the efficiency drop from chlorobenzene solvent to xylene solvent showed following order sp-mOEh-ITIC"

In this work, we have carried out a thorough examination using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)-DFT to investigate the structural and optoelectronic properties of pentacene-based organic molecules (PbOMs) as potential donor material for organic photovoltaic BHJ devices. Our results show that oxadiazole prefers to attach via its nitrogen atoms to the carbon atoms of the pentacene monomer with an adsorption energy about − 32.86 kcal/mol, which means that oxadiazole is efficiently adsorbed on the edge of the pentacene. The HOMO energy level of the PbOM with the lowest bandgap is − 4.00 eV wide, i.e., about 0.86 eV lower and more positive than pentacene, thus providing an ideal open-circuit voltage for photovoltaic devices. The bandgap of the PbOM compounds are about 1.61 and 1.80 eV affording an efficient charge transfer from donor to acceptor. Furthermore, the donor PbOMs are also more stable than the pentacene. We have examined, additionally, the reactivity and absorption properties of individual molecules and PbOM systems. Our results suggest that the PbOM, as a donor material, may significantly improve the efficiency of BHJ solar cells."
177,177,10.1002/chem.202000951,,,Developing Wide Bandgap Polymers Based on Sole Benzodithiophene Units for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells,2020,"In this work, a series of single benzodithiophene-based wide bandgap polymer donors, namely PBDTT, PBDTS, PBDTF and PBDTCl, were developed for efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) by just varying the heteroatoms into the conjugated side chains. The effects of sulfuration, fluorination and chlorination were also investigated systematically on the overall properties of these BDT-based polymers. The HOMO levels could be lowered gradually by introducing sulfur, fluorine and chlorine atoms into the side chains, which contributed to the stepwise increased Voc (from 0.78 V to 0.84 V) in the related PSCs using Y6 as the electron acceptor. On the other hand, above side chain engineering strategy could promote the polymer chain interactions and fine-tune the phase separation of active blends, leading to the enhanced absorption, ordered molecular packing and crystallinity. Among them, the chlorinated PBDTCl exhibited not only high level absorption and crystallinity, but also the most balanced hole/electron charge transport and the most optimized morphology, giving rise to the best PCE of 13.46% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 23.16 mA cm-2 and an FF of 69.2 %. The chlorination strategy afforded PBDTCl synthetic simplicity but high efficiency, showing its promising photovoltaic applications for realizing low-cost practical PSCs in near future."

The phenyl-substituted-BDT, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, and benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) served as the donor, π-bridge, and acceptor units, respectively, to enable linear polymer backbones. When introducing two or four fluorine atoms into the phenyl side units of PE40, the polymers PE42 and PE44 demonstrate a gradual decrease of energy levels and an increase of crystallinity in the pristine and blend films. It was noted that the increase in fluorine atoms gradually improved the performance parameters of polymer solar cells (PSCs) with Y6 as the acceptor. The PE40:Y6 device yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 7.07% with a short-circuit (JSC) of 21.36 mA cm-2, an open-circuVOC) of 0.65 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.51, and PE42:Y6 exhibited a better PCE of 10.11% (JSC = 23.25 mA cm-2, VOC = 0.74 V, and FF = 0.59), while PE44:Y6 exhibited the best PCE of 13.62% (JSC = 25.29 mA cm-2, VOC = 0.82 V, and FF = 0.66). The suitable energy offsets between the donor and the acceptor, high and balanced charge-carrier mobility, and the optimal morphology of the blend film contributed to the high performance of PE44:Y6 combination. Our results demonstrate that introducing more fluorine atoms onto the phenyl side units of BDT is a prospective approach to break the trade-offs between VOC, JSC, and FF, and finally improve the performance of PSCs."

First, the ethynyl-functionalized thiophene was introduced to BT-based SMs with the terminal electron-withdrawing groups 3-phthalimide and 3-ethylrhodanineto, namely BT-1 and BT-2, respectively. Next, to improve their optical absorption, the DPP unit was used as the central unit to replace the BT unit and the electron-withdrawing groups 3-phthalimide, 3-ethylrhodanine, and 1,3-indandione acted as the terminal moiety, giving DPP-1, DPP-2 and DPP-3, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the absorption of DPP-based compounds extended to the near-infrared region,achieving materials with absorption band edges over 850 nm and a narrow bandgap of up to 1.35 eV. The BT-2-based device showed the highest open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V among the molecules due to a deeper HOMO level. Also, besides being a donor material, the BT-based molecules showed potential as acceptor materials. Although the PCE was still low, the bifunctional properties of these materials, which can be used as both donor and acceptor, should be investigated. Among these synthetic SMs, the DPP-1-based device exhibited the best PCE of 4.21% due to its most appropriate energy level and moderate bandgap."
180,180,10.1039/d0ta01636e,,,An asymmetric small molecule acceptor for organic solar cells with a short circuit current density over 24 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>,2020,"In comparison with symmetric small molecule acceptors (SMAs), their asymmetric counterparts have received much less attention. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on asymmetric non-fullerene SMAs previously reported show relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE < 15%) and lower short circuit current densities (Jsc < 20 mA cm−2), although they exhibit a larger dipole moment and stronger intermolecular interactions. Here we report a new asymmetric A–D1A′D2–A type SMA, namely Y22, containing an asymmetric hexacyclic fused donor–acceptor–donor (DA′D) type central framework and end-capped with two electron-deficient 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile moieties. Y22 shows good solubility and a broad near-infrared absorption. The effects of the asymmetric structure on the physicochemical and photovoltaic performance were systematically investigated. Y22-based OSCs were fabricated by using PM6, QX2 and J71 as polymer donors, all exhibiting high PCEs over 10%. Notably, the optimal PM6:Y22-based device shows a high PCE of 15.4% and a high Jsc of 24.37 mA cm−2, which is among the best values reported for asymmetric SMA based OSCs, attributed to the fine nanofiber morphology after thermal annealing and solvent addition. This work demonstrates that the asymmetric fused structure with an electron-deficient-core is a promising building block to build high performance SMAs towards efficient photovoltaic applications."

The introduction of functional groups on both the donor (1-pyrenebutyric acid, PBA) and acceptor (functionalized naphthalene diimide, FNDI) molecules can form stable charge-transfer (CT) complexes within the block copolymer domains and these supramolecules exhibited a charge carrier mobility of around 1.01 × 10-4 cm2 (V s)-1. In this case, both the molecules can form H-bonding with P4VP chains, and as well as π-π stacking between the PBA and FNDI molecules is also possible within the block copolymer domains. These noncovalent interactions lead to the formation of stable hierarchical structures and CT complexes between PBA and FNDI, where bilayer donor-acceptor (D-A) stacks formed within the block copolymer microdomains. Overall, the organization of both functionalized donor and acceptor molecules within the block copolymer domain exhibits an enhanced charge carrier mobility, which is potentially useful in the fabrication of organic photovoltaic cells and organic light-emitting diodes."

All molecules exhibit bathochromic absorption shifts as compared to those of the benzothiadiazole (BT)-based analogues owing to improved electron-withdrawing and quinoidal character of NT and NBT cores that lead to stronger intramolecular charge transfer. Favorable e nergy level alignments with C 70 , together with the good thermal stability and the antiparallel dimeric packing render CPNT and DCPNT suitable donors for vacuum-processed organic photovoltaics (OPV)s. OPVs based on DCPNT : C 70 active layers displayed the best power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) = 8.3%, along with an open circuit voltage of 0.92 V, a short circuit current of 14.5 mA cm -2 and a fill factor of 62% under 1 sun intensity, simulated AM1.5G illumination. Importantly, continuous light-soaking with AM 1.5G illumination has verified the durability of the devices based on CPNT : C 70 and DCPNT : C 70 as the active blends. The devices were examined for their feasibility of indoor light harvesting under 500 lux illumination by a TLD-840 fluorescent lamp, giving PCE = 12.8% and 12.6% , respectively. These results indicate that the NT-based D-A-A'-type donors CPNT and DCPNT are potential candidates for high-stability vacuum-processed OPVs suitable for indoor energy harvesting."
183,183,10.1039/d0nj02407d,,,Tetraphenylethylene-bridged double-branched sensitizers featuring hetero-donors for dye-sensitized solar cells,2020,"Four tetraphenylethylene-bridged X-shaped photosensitizers JY66–69 containing one triphenylamine (TPA) donor and another donor TPA, carbazole, phenothiazine or dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as the neighboring donor were designed and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells. Compared with the symmetrical twin TPA-based dye JY66, the introduction of carbazole or phenothiazine neighboring donor (JY67/JY68) causes a promotion in the dipole moment of the sensitizer, while dye JY69 with DTP as a neighboring donor inversely results in a decrease. Besides the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) rising together with dipole moment, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) displays near linear positive correlation to the vertical dipole moment (μnormal) in this series. Finally, dye JY67 containing TPA and carbazole donor achieves the best photovoltaic performance. Accordingly, decorating such an X-shaped bridge with hetero-donors would be a promising strategy to improve the performance of multi-branched dyes in DSSCs."

Light absorption in organic semiconductors generates a bound electron-hole pair (exciton), which needs to travel to the interface between electron donor and acceptor materials to dissociate into charge carriers. Because the exciton diffusion length in organic semiconductors is typically much shorter than the light absorption depth (∼100 nm), planar donor-acceptor heterojunctions are inefficient, and most effort has been dedicated to optimization of bulk heterojunctions with nanoscale phase separation. In this Perspective, we review recent findings and new approaches to increase the exciton diffusion length and discuss how these improvements can benefit environmentally friendly production of solar modules using organic nanoparticles or graded heterojunctions obtained by sequential deposition of electron donor and acceptor."
185,185,10.1016/j.orgel.2020.105738,,,High absorption coefficient π-conjugation-extended donor-acceptor copolymers for ternary-blend solar cells,2020,"Abstract The effects of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) π-conjugation extensions of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers on their intrinsic and photovoltaic properties in ternary-blend organic solar cells (OSCs) were investigated systematically by using one polymer donor and two acceptors (PC71BM, ITIC). A series of wide bandgap D–A copolymers (PBT-OTTs) were synthesized based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit and the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD) unit, which extend in the backbone (1D) and side-group directions (2D) respectively from the PBT-OTT backbone. These copolymers are PBT-OTT (the parent polymer), PDTBT-OTT (with a 1D backbone extension consisting of dithieno[2,3-d; 2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b; 4,5-b′]dithiophene), PTTBT-OTT (with a 2D side group extension consisting of 2-alkyl thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT)), and PBTBT-OTT (with a 2D side group extension consisting of 2-alkyl benzo[b]thiophene (BT)). Light absorption is significantly increased in the case of PBTBT-OTT due to its extended 2D π-conjugation length and high crystallinity. This increase results from the extended delocalization length and the increased absorption coefficient α of PBTBT-OTT. The wide bandgap polymer PBTBT-OTT has the highest α of the series, so the complementary absorption of the low bandgap ITIC means that the ternary-blend OSCs based on PBTBT-OTT exhibit the highest JSC = 16.61 mA cm−2 and PCE = 8.61%. We believe that these findings provide systematic guidelines for the π-conjugation extension of conjugated polymers and thus the design of high-efficiency ternary-blend OSCs."

Our initial findings demonstrate the donor-dependent methoxy effects. Photovoltaic performance of the HTM with twisted donor highly depends on the methoxy substituent. In contrast, efficiency's reliance on methoxy is insignificant for the HTM with planar donor. The HTM (M123) featuring the methoxy‑substituted carbazole shows a decent power conversion efficiency of 19.33% due to synergistic effects from both planar structure and methoxy. This work gives a guideline to access HTMs reaching both high-performance and good stability."

The donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating structure is an effective strategy for the design of polymers due to its advantages in optical absorption, energy level modulation, charge mobilities, etc. Nevertheless, the current development of polymers is restricted in terms of modification of the acceptor unit. In this work, a 2D conjugated acceptor unit of benzobis(thiazole) was designed for constructing wide bandgap polymers. Fluorine and chlorine atoms were introduced into the polymers to modulate the energy levels and film morphology. The photovoltaic performances of the polymers were examined by fabricating devices employing IT-4F as the acceptor. All three polymers exhibit high short-circuit densities (JSCs) of over 21 mA cm−2 in the devices which could be attributed to high extinction coefficient and beneficial face-on orientation, as featured by the polymers based on the 2D conjugated BBT unit. Incorporation of F- or Cl-atoms effectively improved all three photovoltaic parameters open-circuit voltage (VOC), JSC and fill factor. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency of 14.8% was achieved for the chlorinated polymer (PBB-Cl). A high VOC of 0.94 V and JSC of 21.8 mA cm−2 were realized in the devices, indicating well-balanced VOC and JSC values. Dominant face-on orientation was observed for all three polymer films, which is beneficial for charge transport in the vertical direction of the substrate. Given the excellent photovoltaic performance achieved in the devices, the polymer based on the 2D conjugated BBT unit would be a very promising candidate for high performance organic solar cells."

The quantum transport and the photo-voltaic energy conversion efficiency of the photocell, attached to two external leads, are investigated within the open quantum system approach by solving the Lindblad master equation. The interplay of the vibrational degrees of freedom corresponding to the molecules (via the electron-phonon interaction) and the environment (via dephasing) shows its signature in the efficiency at maximum power. We find vibration assisted electron transport in the medium to strong electron-phonon coupling regime when the system does not suffer dephasing. Exposure to dephasing hampers such a vibration assisted electron transport in a specific range of dephasing rate."
189,189,10.1021/acsami.0c07112,,,Migration of charge-transfer states at organic semiconductor heterojunctions,2020,"Charge-transfer (CT) states formed at organic donor-acceptor (D-A) semiconductor heterojunctions play a critical role in optoelectronic devices. While mobile, their migration has not been extensively characterized. In addition, the factors impacting the CT state diffusion length (LD) have not been elucidated. Here, CT state LD is measured by using photoluminescence quenching for several D-A mixtures, with migration occurring along the bulk heterojunction. All D-A pairings considered yield a similar LD ∼ 5 nm in equal mixtures despite variations in the CT state energy and the constituent molecular structures. The CT state LD varies strongly with mixture composition and is well-correlated to the slowest charge carrier mobility, suggesting a direct method to tune CT state transport. These findings may be applied to elucidate the role of CT state migration in organic photovoltaic and light-emitting devices as well as to broadly explain the transport of interfacial excited states along inorganic and hybrid organic-inorganic heterojunctions."

Their photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were further investigated. TD-DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the trends observed in the optical and electrochemical properties of the dyes. The investigation of the photovoltaic performances of this series of new dyes provided structure–property relationships where their Power Conversion Efficiencies (PCE) could be correlated to structural features, such as the length of the π-conjugated spacer, the nature of the substituents on the pyranylidene electron donor moiety and the number of anchoring groups. Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells based on mono-anchoring dyes were more efficient than the corresponding cells based on di-anchoring analogues due to high dye loading. The highest Power Conversion Efficiency of 5.23% was achieved with the mono-anchoring 17a dye containing t-butyl substituent groups on the pyranylidene fragment and with one thienyl π-conjugated spacer."

A general tactic for adjusting these properties via modification of the conjugated polymer structure is by using different and chosen molecular groups for copolymerization. This communication presents the synthesis of conjugated donor–acceptor type polymers that have the same benzotrithiophene (BTT) donor and different acceptor units, i.e. DPP and fluoro-carbazole substituted thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (FCTP) denoted as P(BTT-DPP) (P1) and P(BTT-FCTP) (P2), respectively, and their photovoltaic performance using as donor, and non-fullerene acceptor (PDIF) in the bulk heterojunction active layer. The bandgaps as well as the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are effectively tuned. The P(BTT-FCTPZ) structure exhibits a smaller bandgap as compared to P(BTT-DPP) that results from the lower LUMO energy and higher HOMO energy due to the FCTP unit. Having optimized the active layers, the PSCs that were based on P(BTT-DPP) and P(BTT-FCTPZ gave an overall power conversion efficiency of about 9.77% and 10.97%, respectively, using a wide bandgap PDIF non-fullerene acceptor, and 8.38% and 9.05, respectively, using PC71BM as electron acceptor."

Here we present the use of pyrrolopyrrole aza-BODIPY (PPAB) as a new acceptor group in D–A polymers in place of a conventional diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor to achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 2.27% despite the ultra-small bandgap of 1.08 eV. The small photon energy loss of the PPAB-based D–A polymer and moderately high short-circuit current of 8.52 mA cm−2 arising from the panchromatic visible/NIR absorption guarantee PPAB as a potential building block of D–A polymers for NIR photovoltaics.
194,194,10.1080/15421406.2020.1741821,,,Structure engineering of small molecules for organic solar cells,2020,"Abstract Two 1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)−5,7-bis(2-ehtylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c]-dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) based small molecules, SM1 and SM2 are designed and synthesized by incorporating benzodithiophene (BDT) central core, BDD dual accepting units and 3-ethyl rhodamine as endcap group with various number of BDT units. We systematically investigated the synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic characteristics of these donor materials. The number of BDT units have a significant influence on Jsc due to interconnected structure and results in a broader absorption on thin film. The inverted devices employed for both small molecules exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 0.41% for SM1 and 0.82% for SM2."
195,195,10.1080/15421406.2020.1741820,,,Synthesis and characterization of new dyes based on chromone malononitrile as the electron withdrawing group and their photovoltaic effect,2020,"Abstract Two new small molecule dyes for the donor material, named IDTT-OX and IDTT-EPMP-IDC have been successfully synthesized and characterized for solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). These dyes are containing indacedithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as the donor moiety, phenylisoxazolone (OX) and malononitrile derivatives (EPMP-IDC) as the acceptor. IDTT-OX exhibits a strong self-aggregation behavior and broad absorption with an optical band gap of 1.88 eV. While IDTT-EPMP-IDC shows different behavior, the self-aggregation of IDTT-EPMP was efficiently restricted by the presence of the alkyl group at EPMP-IDC functional group in the molecule and it has 1.60 eV optical bandgap. The inverted-type OSCs based on the blend of IDTT-OX (or IDTT-EPMP-IDC) as a donor, PC71BM as an acceptor are fabricated. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the optimized OSCs are reached up to 0.29% for IDTT-OX and 2.07% for IDTT-EPMP-IDC."
196,196,10.1039/d0mh00385a,,,Temperature dependence of the spectral line-width of charge-transfer state emission in organic solar cells; Static: Vs. dynamic disorder,2020,"The origin of energetic disorder in organic semiconductors and its impact on opto-electronic properties remains a topic of intense controversy. Particularly the disorder at electron donor–acceptor interfaces for organic photovoltaics is pivotal to understand as it is expected to affect photo-carrier generation, recombination and consequently device efficiency parameters. In this work we evaluate the temperature dependence of the line-shape of the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra of small molecule:fullerene blend devices, with the ambition to disentangle dynamic and static disorder contributions. The EL emission spectra are dominated by charge-transfer (CT) state emission and are confirmed to be of Gaussian character and almost completely voltage independent. More importantly, a strong line-width narrowing is persistently observed upon cooling, down to a certain material specific low temperature, below which the line-width remains constant. It is consequently clear that the main portion of the line-width measured at operating conditions of room temperature or higher, is originating from thermally activated, or dynamic, disorder. The observed temperature dependence of the high-energy emission tail can be fully described by taking into account high and low frequency molecular vibrational modes, without having to rely on static disorder. The presence of low frequency molecular modes with large Huang–Rhys factors results in a Gaussian line-shape, which is additionally broadened at high temperature by thermal population of high frequency intra-molecular modes. We therefore cast strong doubts regarding the commonly used assumption that single temperature optical measurements of absorption or emission tails are able to provide meaningful information regarding the shape of a static density of states tail."
197,197,10.1039/d0se00206b,,,Self-assembled bulk heterojunctions from integral molecules with nonconjugately linked donor and acceptor units for photovoltaic applications,2020,"A bicontinuous interpenetrating donor–acceptor network with a suitable phase-separated domain size is crucial for fabricating highly efficient organic bulk heterojunction solar cells considering the fact that it guarantees effective exciton dissociation and smooth charge transport. For traditional binary blend bulk heterojunctions, the photoactive layer is a simple physical mixture of the donor and acceptor; further, the size of phase separation is primarily determined by the aggregation characteristics of the donor and acceptor. Moreover, it is difficult to control and stabilize it. To resolve this problem, a kind of donor–acceptor integral molecule in which the donor and acceptor units are linked by nonconjugated flexible linking units has been proposed. The energy levels and absorption spectra of the integral molecules can be easily controlled by tuning the donor and acceptor units. Furthermore, these integral molecules can form a microphase-separated bulk heterojunction of the donor and acceptor phases via a self-assembly process of the molecule, which is governed by the flexible linking unit responsible for connecting the donor and acceptor units. Since the donor and acceptor units of the integral molecules are connected by nonconjugated units, the scale of aggregation and morphological stability can be easily controlled. In this review, we first introduce the unique characteristics of three typical donor–acceptor integral molecules and then highlight their current developments. For each donor–acceptor molecule, we attempt to give a detailed summary with regard to their design and synthesis, and an in-depth understanding on the basic mechanism of molecular self-assembly and the performance comparison of SMSCs. In the end, the prospect and potential improvements in the donor–acceptor integral molecule are addressed. We believe that emerging donor–acceptor molecules can provide worthwhile opportunities for the fabrication of efficient and stable organic solar cells."
198,198,10.1039/d0se00276c,,,Doping strategies of organic n-type materials in perovskite solar cells: A chemical perspective,2020,"The ultimate aim of research dealing with perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the commercialization of this novel kind of photovoltaic technology. In order to achieve this goal, the efficiency of the cells and even more their stability have to be optimized. Resorting to additives is a simple but effective technique to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells and enhance their stability. Several doping strategies have been tried during the years, involving either the charge transporting layers, the electrodes, or the perovskite layer. Doping has mostly been investigated within the field of hole transporting materials (HTMs), while less research has been focused on electron transporting layers (ETLs). Herein we summarize for the first time the most notable advances in the n-type doping of organic ETLs in PSCs, highlighting bathocuproines, halogen-ammonium salts, electron-donor molecules, N-DMBI and their derivatives, polymer-based dopants, carbon nanoforms, and other structures that cannot be classified in the previously categories."
199,199,10.1002/smll.202001942,,,"Conformation-Tuning Effect of Asymmetric Small Molecule Acceptors on Molecular Packing, Interaction, and Photovoltaic Performance",2020,"Understanding the conformation effect on molecular packing, miscibility, and photovoltaic performance is important to open a new avenue for small-molecule acceptor (SMA) design. Herein, two novel acceptor-(donor-acceptor1-donor)-acceptor (A-DA1D-A)-type asymmetric SMAs are developed, namely C-shaped BDTP-4F and S-shaped BTDTP-4F. The BDTP-4F-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) with PM6 as donor, yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.24%, significantly higher than that of the BTDTP-4F-based device (13.12%). The better PCE for BDTP-4F-based device is mainly attributed to more balanced charge transport, weaker bimolecular recombination, and more favorable morphology. Additionally, two traditional A-D-A-type SMAs (IDTP-4F and IDTTP-4F) are also synthesized to investigate the conformation effect on morphology and device performance. Different from the device result above, here, IDTP-4F with S-shape conformation outperforms than IDTTP-4F with C-shape conformation. Importantly, it is found that for these two different types of SMA, the better performing binary blend has similar morphological characteristics. Specifically, both PM6:BDTP-4F and PM6:IDTP-4F blend exhibit perfect nanofibril network structure with proper domain size, obvious face-on orientation and enhance donor-acceptor interactions, thereby better device performance. This work indicates tuning molecular conformation plays pivotal role in morphology and device effciciency, shining a light on the molecular design of the SMAs."

In this study, compounds containing boron β-ketoiminate (BKI) as a chromophore were synthesized and used as dye sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells. The new dyes were orange or red crystals and showed maximum absorptions in the 410-450 nm wavelength region on titanium dioxide substrates. These electrodes exhibited maximum efficiencies of over 80% in incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra, suggesting that the continuous process of light absorption-excitation-electron injection was effectively performed. Open-circuit photovoltages were relatively high owing to the large dipole moments of the BKI dyes with a linear molecular structure. Thus, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.3% was successfully observed. Comparison of BKI dyes with boron β-diketonate dyes revealed certain differences in solution stability, spectral properties, and photovoltaic characteristics."

At T = 10 K three PL bands were detected at about 1.919 eV (#1), 1.855 eV (#2) and 1.748 eV (#3). The temperature and laser power dependencies indicate that the properties of PL bands can be explained by donor- acceptor pair model, where the #1 and #2 bands result from a recombination between distant pairs involving the same shallow acceptor VCu with EA ≈ 30 meV and different deep donor defects. The #3 PL band originates from the deep donor-deep acceptor pair recombination where the depth of deep acceptor defect is more than 157 meV. Detailed analysis of the PL spectra show the absence of deep potential or band gap fluctuations in this material making it suitable for photovoltaic applications."

In this work, a novel donor material (ECTBD) consisting of benzodithiophene (BDT) central electron donor unit was developed and synthesized. The small molecular donor has the same central unit as PM6. The addition of ECTBD into PM6:Y6 system could improve the morphology of active blend layer. In addition, ECTBD showed good morphologically compatibility when blending with PM6:Y6 host, resulting in the improvement of fill factor and current density. As a result, the ternary devices based on PM6:ECTBD:Y6 ternary system achieved a highest PCE of 16.51% with fill factor of 76.24%, which was much higher than that of the binary devices (15.7%). Overall, this work provided an effective strategy to fabricate highly efficient ternary organic solar cells through design of the novel small molecular donor as the third component."
205,205,10.1021/acsami.0c07856,,,Synergistic Effect of Alkyl Chain and Chlorination Engineering on High-Performance Nonfullerene Acceptors,2020,"In this work, three new nonfullerene acceptors (BT6IC-BO-4Cl, BT6IC-HD-4Cl, and BT6IC-OD-4Cl), which comprise a central fused benzothiadiazole core, two dichlorinated end groups, and substituted with different branched alkyl chain (2-butyloctyl, longer 2-hexyldecyl, and 2-octyldodecyl), are successfully designed and prepared. The influences of the branched alkyl chain with different lengths on the electronic/optoelectronic property, electrochemistry, and photovoltaic performance are systematically investigated. It has been revealed that BT6IC-HD-4Cl, which had the medium alkyl chain (2-hexyldecyl) length, has the best photovoltaic performance when using PDBT-TF as the electron donor. The BT6IC-HD-4Cl-based device shows impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.90%, much higher than that of BT6IC-BO-4Cl (14.45%) and BT6IC-OD-4Cl (9.60%)-based devices. All these evidence shows that the subtle changes in the alkyl substituent of these high-performance chlorinated acceptors can have a big impact on the structural order and molecular packing of the resultant nonfullerene acceptors, ultimately the photovoltaic performance of their final solar devices."

207,207,10.1039/d0tc01313g,,,Green solvent-processed organic solar cells based on a low cost polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor,2020,"Low cost photovoltaic materials and green solvent processing are important issues for commercial application of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we fabricated high-performance OSCs based on the low-cost conjugated polymer PTQ10 as a donor and the small molecule n-type organic semiconductor HO-IDIC-2F as an acceptor, using non-halogen tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the processing solvent. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the as-cast OSCs reached 12.20%, which is comparable with the ones processed with chloroform (CF) (12.43%). Thermal stability of the active layer was also studied by thermal treatment at 100 °C for 8 hours. As a result, the active layer morphology remained unchanged and the PCE of the devices still reached 12.13%, indicating a good thermal-stability of the PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F blend film. As is commonly known, for OSCs fabricated on larger scales, the layer-by-layer (LL) method generally provides more advantages than the traditional D–A blend solution-processing method. Therefore, to test the compatibility of the THF solvent in the LL method, we fabricated blade-coated LL devices with THF as a single type of solvent for both the donor and acceptor, and the PCE could reach up to 11.85%. The surprisingly high performance of the blade-coated OSC based on the green solvent indicates that PTQ10 is a promising donor to be processed in green solvent for LL technology in the future."

209,209,10.1016/j.joule.2020.03.023,,,Fine-Tuning Energy Levels via Asymmetric End Groups Enables Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiencies over 17%,2020,"Summary Generally, it is important to fine-tune the energy levels of donor and acceptor materials in the field of polymer solar cell (PSCs) to achieve a minimal highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy offset, which yet is still sufficient for charge separation. Based on the high-performance small-molecule acceptor (SMA) of BTP-4F, we modified the end groups of BTP-4F from IC-2F to CPTCN-Cl. It was found that when both end groups were substituted by CPTCN-Cl, the energy level upshift was too large that caused unfavorable energetic alignment, thus poor device performance. By using the strategy of asymmetric end groups, we were able to achieve near optimal energy level match, resulting in higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared with those given by the PM6:BTP-4F system. Our strategy can be useful and potentially applied to other material systems for maximizing efficiency of non-fullerene PSCs."

In this manuscript, we report three novel small molecular donors with branching points at the 1-, 2-, and 3-positions in alkyl terminal chains, called BSCl-C1, BSCl-C2 and BSCl-C3, respectively. Using IDIC-4Cl as acceptor, the subtle branching position shift achieves a dramatic disparity in photovoltaic parameters, as indicated by the short circuit current (Jsc) changing from 4.90 mA cm-2 to 20.1 mA cm-2 to 14.2 mA cm-2 and the fill factor varying from 33.9% to 71.3% to 67.0% for BSCl-C1, BSCl-C2, and BSCl-C3, respectively. The best device performance of 12.4% is obtained by the BSCl-C2:IDIC-4Cl system, which not only ranks among the top values reported to date, but also exhibits low energy loss in systems that use IDIC as acceptors. The notable device performance based on BSCl-C2 is attributed to the optimized phase morphology caused by the strong molecular crystallinity and suitable intermolecular interaction with IDIC-4Cl. These results demonstrate that suitably tuning the branching position of terminal groups could promote the high performance of ASM-OSCs."

Optimized reaction protocol leads to a donor-acceptor conjugated polymer in good yield, with less structural defects than its analog obtained from Suzuki polycondensation, and with similar or even higher molecular weight than other previously reported polymers based on the 2,3-dialkoxynaphthalene monomer. The batch-to-batch repeatability of the optimized DAP conditions for the synthesis of PEHONDTBT was proved, showing the robustness of the synthetic strategy. The structure of PEHONDTBT was corroborated by NMR, exhibiting good solubility in common organic solvents, good film-forming ability, and thermal stability. PEHONDTBT film presented an absorption band centered at 498 nm, a band gap of 2.15 eV, and HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.31 eV and −3.17 eV, respectively. Theoretical calculations were performed to understand the regioselectivity in the synthesis of PEHONDTBT and to rationalize its optoelectronic properties.

In this study, we explore the energy levels and charge-transfer states at the organic donor/acceptor interfaces on the basis of the fragment-based GW and Bethe–Salpeter equation approach. The face-on and edge-on orientations of pentacene/C60 bilayer heterojunctions have employed as model systems. GW+Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations were performed for the local interface structures in the face-on and edge-on bilayer heterojunctions, which contain approximately 2000 atoms. Calculated energy levels and charge-transfer state absorption spectra are in reasonable agreements with those obtained from experimental measurements. We found that the dependence of the energy levels on interfacial morphology is predominantly determined by the electrostatic contribution of polarization energy, while the effects of induction contribution in the edge-on interface are similar to those in the face-on. Moreover, the delocalized charge-transfer states contribute to the main absorption peak in the edge-on interface, while the face-on interface features relatively localized charge-transfer states in the main absorption peak. The impact of the interfacial morphologies on the polarization and charge delocalization effects is analyzed in detail."

The structural, morphological and optical properties of the films were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–Visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy. Detailed analysis has shown that films were having cubic phase with orientation along (111) plane and the optical band gap reduced from 2.17 to 1.53 eV when x was varied from 0 to 1. SEM micrographs confirmed the homogeneity of the films. Depending on the composition, Raman peaks of CZT samples were mixture of the fundamental modes of the CdTe and ZnTe and indicate “trigonal” lattice of Tellurium (Te). Analysis of PL spectra suggested tellurium as isoelectronic exciton traps, recombination of carriers in the surface traps and donor-acceptor pair present in the samples. Under electrical properties, p to n-type conversion was witnessed for x = 0.4 and above.

The effect of thermal stress/annealing on energy level alignment and related properties of the devices are less discussed compared to the extensively explored effect on morphology and corresponding device performance. Here all polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are employed to study thermal annealing effects on energy level alignment and the corresponding effect on the device properties of the all-PSCs. It is found that optimized energy level alignment can be achieved by thermal annealing. An interface dipole layer at the donor/acceptor interface is introduced by energy level realignment that assists charge generation by reducing geminate recombination so that the voltage loss is dramatically reduced, improving the performance of the all-PSCs."

To further improve the performance of such OSCs, we reported a bilayer device structure, which was fabricated by sequentially spin-coating a p-type polymer semiconductor (poly[4,4′-bis(2-butyloctoxycarbonyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5-diyl)-alt-(2,2′bithiophene-5,5′diyl)]) (PDCBT) layer and a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer with the cyclometalated Ir complex (TBzIr) as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor. Compared to the original TBzIr:PC71BM BHJ device, the bilayer PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM structure exhibited an identical high open circuit voltage of 0.92 V, and increased both short circuit current from 9.25 to 11.14 mA cm−2 and fill factor from 0.46 to 0.61. The p-type PDCBT layer was inserted to afford increased light absorption, assist the upper BHJ blends to form optimized morphologies, and provide supplementary donor–acceptor interfaces to facilitate exciton dissociation. Therefore, the PCE could be significantly improved from 3.91% for TBzIr:PC71BM to 6.17% for PDCBT/TBzIr:PC71BM.

220,220,10.1039/d0nj00723d,,,Density functional theory study on the donating strength of donor systems in dye-sensitized solar cells,2020,"The electron-donating strengths of donor (D) moieties in thirteen donor–π–acceptor systems (D1–π–A to D13–π–A wherein –π– and A represent butadiene and cyanoacrylic acid units, respectively) have been studied using B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The selected D moieties are encountered as a part of an organic sensitizer molecule in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. When the D moiety is joined with π–A, a certain amount of electron donation from D to A occurs leading to an increase in electron density at the A site of D–π–A compared to the A site of π–A. This electron reorganization is quantified in terms of a change in molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) minimum (ΔVmA) at the acceptor site, the CN group of the cyanoacrylic acid. The ΔVmA is always negative, in the range of −11.0 to −2.6 kcal mol−1 which provides a quick assessment of the rank order of the electron-donating nature of the D moieties in the ground state of D–π–A. The optical and photovoltaic properties of D and D–π–A systems are also determined at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. An absorption red shift (Δλmax) in the range of 81–242 nm is observed when D moieties change to D–π–A systems. The ground state property ΔVmA showed a strong linear correlation with the excited state property Δλmax. Furthermore, ΔVmA is found to be proportional to the open-circuit voltage (VOC). The resemblance of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of the D–π–A system with the respective energies of donor and π–A systems shows that the donor tunes the HOMO, while π–A tunes the LUMO. Among the thirteen D–π–A systems, N,N-dialkylaniline, and julolidine are rated as the best donors for the photovoltaic applications. This study shows that the MESP based assessment of the donating strength of donor systems offers a powerful rational design strategy for the development of efficient dyes for DSSC applications."

However, the photovoltaic properties of RCTs yet lagged behind that of donor-Acceptor alternating copolymer, especially in the additive-free devices. Hence, we developed two feasible ""double acceptor type"" random conjugated terpolymers, PBDB-TAZ20 and PBDB-TAZ40. PBDB-TAZ20: ITIC and PBDB-TAZ40:ITIC based additive-free NF-PSCs exhibit decent PCEs of 12.34% and 11.27%, respectively, more superior to the PBDB-T:ITIC-based device. For the RCTs, the reasonably weakened crystallinity and optimized phase separation degree are demonstrated to help improve charge transport, reduce bimolecular recombination and thus enhance the photovoltaic performance of additive-free NF-PSCs. The results imply that adding a third moiety into the D-A polymer donors provides a simple yet efficient synthetic methodology for high-performance NF-PSCs."

In this concise contribution, we demonstrate that three alkyls namely branched alkyl 2-butyloctyl (2BO), long linear alkyl n-dodecyl (C12), and double-short linear alkyl n-hexyls (DC6) incorporated into the side chains of large bandgap polymer donor PBDT-TTz can induce considerable, of significance, and different electronic, optical, and morphological parameters. Systematic studies shed light on the critical role of the double-short linear alkyl n-hexyls (DC6) in (i) producing large ionization potential value, (ii) increasing propensity of the polymer to order along the π-stacking direction, (iii) generating polymer crystallites with more preferential ""face-on"" orientation, consequently, (iv) improvement of carriers transportation, (v) suppression of charge recombination in all-polymer devices. In parallel, we unearth that the PBDT-TTz with double-short linear alkyl n-hexyls (DC6) represents highest efficiency of 8.3%, whereas, the other two PBDT-TTz analogues (2BO, C12) yield efficiencies of less than 3% in optimized all-polymer solar cells. Though branched or long linear alkyl side chains (2BO, C12) have been applied to provide the solution processability of conjugated polymers, motifs bearing multiple short linear alkyl substituents (DC6) are proved critical to the development of high performing polymers."

Depth profiles of electrostatic potential and contact-induced charges determine the energy-level lineup of the frontier orbitals at electrode/organic and organic heterointerfaces. They are critical for the elementary processes in an OPV cell, such as generation and diffusion of free carriers. A simple electrostatic model describes the energetics in organic heterojunctions supported by an electrode, and experiments via photoelectron spectroscopy and the Kelvin probe method validate the potential distribution in the stacking direction of the device. A comparative study has clarified the significance of Fermi-level pinning and resulting electrostatic fields in determining the energy-level alignment. In this review, we discuss how parameters of device constituents affect the distributions of potential and the dark charges in conventional OPVs comprising metallophthalocyanine and C60 as donor and acceptor, respectively. The results of previous studies, together with additional numerical simulations, suggest that a number of the factors influence the depth profiles of the dark charge and potential, such as the work function of bottom materials, layer thickness, structural inhomogeneity at interfaces, top electrode, and stacking sequence."

The compounds were designed to study the relationship between end-capping donor groups’ structure on their optoelectronic and thermal properties as well as the dye-sensitized solar cells’ performance. The effect of π-conjugation enlargement by incorporation of different heterocyclic substituents possessing various electron–donor affinities was systematically experimentally and theoretically examined.

Having started their intensive development two decades ago, their low cost, processability and flexibility rapidly funneled the interest of the scientific community, searching for new solutions to expand solar photovoltaics market and promote sustainable development. However, their robust implementation is hampered by some issues, concerning the choice of the donor/acceptor materials, the device thermal/photo-stability, and, last but not least, their morphology. Indeed, the morphological profile of BHJs has a strong impact over charge generation, collection, and recombination processes; control over nano/microstructural morphology would be desirable, aiming at finely tuning the device performance and overcoming those previously mentioned critical issues. The employ of compatibilizers has emerged as a promising, economically sustainable, and widely applicable approach for the donor/acceptor interface (D/A-I) optimization. Thus, improvements in the global performance of the devices can be achieved without making use of more complex architectures. Even though several materials have been deeply documented and reported as effective compatibilizing agents, scientific reports are quite fragmentary. Here we would like to offer a panoramic overview of the literature on compatibilizers, focusing on the progression documented in the last decade."

In this work, two new small molecule donor materials are synthesized with different substituents on their thiophene conjugated side chains, including SM1-S with alkylthio and SM1-F with fluorine and alkyl substituents, and the previously reported donor molecule SM1 with an alkyl substituent, for investigating the effect of different conjugated side chains on the molecular aggregation and the photophysical, and photovoltaic properties of the donor molecules. As a result, an SM1-F-based SM-OSC with Y6 as the acceptor, and with thermal annealing (TA) at 120 °C for 10 min, demonstrates the highest power conversion efficiency value of 14.07%, which is one of the best values for SM-OSCs reported so far. Besides, these results also reveal that different side chains of the small molecules can distinctly influence the crystallinity characteristics and aggregation features, and TA treatment can effectively fine-tune the phase separation to form suitable donor-acceptor interpenetrating networks, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transportation, leading to highly efficient photovoltaic performance."

The terminal units of 4-cyanophenyl and 4-methoxyphenyl were introduced into ZnPTDPPCN and ZnPTDPPO respectively, and the structural modification effects on photoelectric and photovoltaic performance were fully investigated. Depending on the characteristics of porphyrin and DPP, all three molecules possess narrow bandgaps of lower than 1.50 eV, showing excellent absorption properties. Structural modification of terminal groups can effectively regulate energy levels of ZnPTDPPCN and ZnPTDPPO. As expected, extended molecular structure from D-A type to D-A-A1 or D-A-D1 type, was conducive to enlarging the π-conjugation and affecting the push-pull effect of intramolecular electrons, thus affecting the photoelectric character of materials. Solution-processed OSCs employing these molecules as the donor materials and PC61BM as the acceptor material were fabricated. It was worth mentioning that devices based on materials ZnPTDPPCN and ZnPTDPPO achieved moderate power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.26% and 4.24%, respectively, while ZnPTDPP showed an inferior PCE of 1.46%. To our knowledge, the work based on asymmetric porphyrin-DPP backbone for solution-processed OSCs, is first reported. The work will provide valuable hints for rational design of asymmetric porphyrin-based donor materials."

The compounds have cyclopentadithiophene-vinylene (CPDTV) oligomers of different lengths as the central donor core linked with different terminal acceptor units (3-ethylrhodanine or dicyanomethylene-3-ethylrhodanine). The effects that conjugation length and terminal acceptor units have on the optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. These small molecules were used as donors in conjunction with PC71BM as an acceptor in the bulk heterojunction active layer for the fabrication of solution-processed organic solar cells. Solvent vapor annealing treatment improved the crystallinity and the interpenetrating networks of donor and acceptor phases for exciton dissociation and charge transfer, thus leading to significant improvements in the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the organic solar cells. The PCE values for the organic solar cells based on the optimized FG1:PC71BM, FG2:PC71BM, FG3:PC71BM and FG4:PC71BM active layer were 5.58%, 6.99%, 7.51% and 8.43%, respectively. These results indicate that an enhancement in the PCE of small molecule organic solar cells can be achieved by an increase in conjugation-length and variation of terminal acceptor units in the molecular backbone of small molecules and optimization of the crystallinity and nanoscale interpenetrating morphology by appropriate solvent vapor annealing treatment."
233,233,10.1021/acsami.0c01382,,,"Effects of a Fluorinated Donor Polymer on the Morphology, Photophysics, and Performance of All-Polymer Solar Cells Based on Naphthalene Diimide-Arylene Copolymer Acceptors",2020,"Naphthalene diimide (NDI)-biselenophene copolymer (PNDIBS) and NDI-selenophene copolymer (PNDIS) and the fluorinated donor polymer PM6 were used to investigate how a fluorinated polymer component affects the morphology and performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Although the PM6:PNDIBS blend system exhibits a high open-circuit voltage (Voc = 0.925 V) and desired low optical bandgap energy loss (Eloss = 0.475 eV), the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) was 3.1%. In contrast, PM6:PNDIS blends combine a high Voc (0.967 V) with a high fill factor (FF = 0.70) to produce efficient all-PSCs with 9.1% PCE. Furthermore, the high performance PM6:PNDIS all-PSCs could be fabricated by various solution processing approaches and at active layer thickness as high as 300 nm without compromising photovoltaic efficiency. The divergent photovoltaic properties of PNDIS and PNDIBS when paired respectively with PM6 are shown to originate from the starkly different blend morphology and blend photophysics. Efficient PM6:PNDIS blend films were found to exhibit a vertical phase stratification along with lateral phase separation while the molecular packing had a predominant face-on orientation. Bulk lateral phase separation with both face-on and edge-on molecular orientations featured in the poor performing PM6:PNDIBS blend films. Enhanced charge photogeneration and suppressed geminate and bimolecular recombinations with 99% charge collection probability found in PM6:PNDIS blends strongly differ from the poor charge collection probability (66%) and high electron-hole pair recombination seen in PM6:PNDIBS. Our findings demonstrate that beyond the generally expected enhancement of Voc, a fluorinated polymer component in all-PSCs can also exert a positive or negative influence on photovoltaic performance via the blend morphology and blend photophysics."

With efficiencies exceeding 16.5%, single junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices are amongst the most promising and are nearing commercialisation. One recent avenue of research has focused on statistical conjugated copolymers. However, a detailed investigation as to why these materials can achieve higher power conversion efficiencies than their regular alternating counterparts is seldom reported. This work describes an investigation into donor–acceptor polymers demonstrating how differing monomer activities can lead to differing microstructures in a simple batch reaction, which in turn demonstrates promising optoelectronic and morphological properties required for organic photovoltaic devices. A one pot condensation polymerisation reaction with three monomers leads to an ABA triblock structure from differing monomer reactivities. This structure in turn leads to visualised phase separation which is possibly linked to an increase in performance. Further to this we report on the reliability of the Stille coupling for the synthesis of conjugated polymers."

However, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF), an analogue of BDT, has received less attention than BDT. The photovoltaic performance of BDF copolymers has lagged behind that of BDT copolymers. Here, we designed and synthesized two BDF copolymers, PBF1-C and PBF1-C-2Cl. PBF1-C-2Cl, which is composed of BDF and benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione connected by a chlorinated thiophene π-bridge, displays a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, which helps in yielding a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) in OSCs. As a result, when blended with Y6, PBF1-C-2Cl-based devices showed a high Voc of 0.83 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.10%.

Indeed, the modification of TIPS side chains on BDT backbone found to distinctly affect their opto-electrochemical properties, molecular orientations and nanoscale morphologies in resultant polymers. Among the polymers, optimized organic solar cells (OSCs) of P1:PC71BM exhibited best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.55% with a very high VOC of 1.02 V, thereby outperforming P2 and P3 (PCE of 4.72% and 5.47%, respectively). The detailed characterization of optimized blends revealed that this superior device performance of P1:PC71BM blend films attributed to their compact and “face-on” molecular orientation, high hole mobility and superior nanoscale morphology, which minimized voltage loss and leading to an efficient charge transfer with low recombination losses in OCSs. In contrast, lower performances of P2 and P3 were mainly originating from their decreased solubilities caused by the insertion of TIPS-Th or TIPS-ThC8, thereby negatively affecting their molecular weights, morphology and charge carrier mobilities. Thus, these results provide a valuable guideline for designing polymers based on 2-TIPSTh substituted BDT units."

These non-fullerene acceptors are used to fabricate organic solar cells (OSCs) by blending with regioregular middle bandgap polymer reg-PThE. The as-cast devices based on reg-PThE:CDT-TFP show the best PCE of 8.36% with a Voc of 1.10 V, Jsc of 12.43 mA cm-2 and FF of 61.4%; whereas, the analogue PDI dimers (CDT-PDI) that comprising two PDI units bridged with a CDT unit, show only a 2.59% PCE with a Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 6.82 mA cm-2 and FF of 41.5%. Our results have demonstrated that non-fullerene acceptors comprising planar PDI units can achieve excellent photovoltaic performance and provide meaningful guidelines for the design of PDI based non-fullerene electron acceptors for efficient OSCs."

With the increase in the number of fused rings, production costs and production difficulties increase. Compared with other non-fullerenes, small molecule INTIC has the advantages of easy synthesis and strong and wide infrared absorption. According to our previous report, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of an organic solar cell using PTB7-Th:INTIC as the active layer was 7.27%. In this work, other polymers, PTB7, PBDB-T and PBDB-T-2F, as the donor materials, with INTIC as the acceptor, are selected to fabricate cells with the same structure to optimize their photovoltaic performance. The experimental results show that the optimal PCE of PBDB-T:INTIC based organic solar cells is 11.08%, which, thanks to the open voltage (VOC) increases from 0.80 V to 0.84 V, the short circuit current (JSC) increases from 15.32 mA/cm2 to 19.42 mA/cm2 and the fill factor (FF) increases from 60.08% to 67.89%, then a 52.4% improvement in PCE is the result, compared with the devices based on PTB7-Th:INTIC. This is because the PBDB-T:INTIC system has better carrier dissociation and extraction, carrier transportation and higher carrier mobility."

Even the new materials have a significant high molecular weight, they are obtained with high yields and are completely soluble in organic solvents which helps the solution processability of organic devices. One of the synthesized small molecules has a terminal alkyl chain and the other is longer in conjugation length by thiophene ring extension. The alternating donor/acceptor units improves the intramolecular charge transfer across the backbone structure. The absorption spectra, electrochemical properties, hole mobility, morphology of the cast films, and photovoltaic performance are investigated considering the different in the terminal group of the synthesized materials, the presence of different donor and acceptor moieties as well as (ED-ID-ED) π-bridge unit. Small molecules under study possess broad absorption with low band gaps which encouraged us to screen the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of their photovoltaic cells.

Herein, a new donor polymer, named PBTT-F, based on a strongly electron-deficient core (5,7-dibromo-2,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione, TTDO), is developed through the design of cyclohexane-1,4-dione embedded into a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) unit.

In this paper, four aromatic fused rings were selected as electron donor units to construct photosensitizers PBT–series. The effects of structural differences in the donor moiety on the photophysical and photochemical properties of the molecules were investigated in detail. The results show that the devices based on the dyes with triphenylene or fluoranthene as electron donor can yield higher short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc) and open-circuit voltages (Voc) than the devices based on the reference dyes with pyrene or phenanthrene as electron donor, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is increased by 37% and 23%, respectively. PBT–2 and PBT–4 sensitizers have better light absorption properties due to stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) charge transitions, which helps to increase the photocurrent of devices, while they also exhibit significantly lower charge recombination rates. Eventually, PBT–2-based devices showed the best power conversion efficiency of 7.67% under the standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions."

In these sensitizers, an alkyl oligothiophene π-spacer is used to link the 2-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor with varied arylamines donors, i.e. carbazole (TD1), phenothiazine (TD2) or triphenylamine (TD3). The effects of different donor units on the photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of sensitizers are investigated in detail. They all show intensive UV–vis absorption around 400 nm with rod-like molecular structures. The co-sensitizations of TD1–TD3 with ruthenium complex N719 are further evaluated. Consequently, the co-sensitized DSSCs demonstrate superior photovoltaic performances with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) ranging from 7.60% to 8.02% in relation to the cell with N719 (PCE = 7.29%) alone, which is mainly ascribed to the higher short-circuit photocurrents (Jsc) in combination with larger open-circuit voltages (Voc). Moreover, the origins of these improvements are examined by incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations. The Jsc is improved because TD1–TD3 could compensate for the photocurrent loss induced by I−/I3−; whereas, the Voc is enhanced owing to the fact that the electron recombination process is retarded upon co-sensitization."

To obtain efficient PSCs, it is crucial to employ suitable donor/acceptor pair with matched electronic energy levels, complementary absorption spectra, appropriate molecular self-assembly behavior and preferred blend film morphology, which can be achieved by rational molecular structure optimization. Here we develop three D-A copolymer donors J55, J65 and J75 based on identical building blocks of bithienyl-benzodithiophene (BDTT) D-unit and bifluorine substituted benzotriazole A-unit with different flexible side-chains on BDTT unit to regulate the molecular electronic energy levels and molecular aggregation features, for further improving photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. The three D-A copolymers showed similar absorption profiles due to the identical building blocks. In comparison with the alkyl side-chain substituted polymer J55, the polymers J65 and J75 with alkylthio side-chain and alkylsilyl side-chain showed gradually down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (EHOMO) of −5.38 and −5.43 eV, respectively, which is beneficial for obtaining high open-circuit voltage (Voc). The favorable morphology with preferred face-on orientation and stronger integrated intensity of the π-π stacking peak was formed in J75 blend, which contributes to charge transport, thus enhancing the fill factor (FF) and Jsc. The PSC with J75 as donor and ITIC as acceptor exhibits an efficient PCE of 11.07%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, an enhanced Jsc of 16.99 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 69.29%."

Effects of the fluorine substitution in the asymmetric IT donor units on the electronic structure, ordering structure, photovoltaic properties, and charge generation and recombination dynamics were investigated. It is found that side-chain fluorination in the asymmetric donor units of the D-A polymers endowed the relative polymers with a deeper HOMO level, higher and more balanced charge mobilites, increased charge dissociation efficiency and reduced bimolecular recombination. As a result, the bulk heterojunction solar cell based on the blend film of PITPhf-DfQx and PC71BM demonstrated an efficiency of 6.10%, whereas the cell efficiency based on PITPh-DfQx was only 3.00%. In addition, a triblock copolymer, poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) (SBS), was employed for the first time as a polymer additive into the active layers based on PITPh-DfQx/PC71BM and PITPhf-DfQx/PC71BM devices to promote donor crystallization and tune the extent of phase separation between the donor and acceptor. The presence of SBS obviously improved the molecule packing and induced the crystallization of the two polymers, giving rise to a better phase separation due to enhanced aggregation effect of photovoltaic polymers. Therefore, with a small addition of SBS, the optimal PCE was further increased from 6.10% to 6.60% for PITPhf-DfQx based device and from 3.00% to 5.50% for PITPh-DfQx based device. The positive effects of SBS additive on the performance of photovoltaic polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells provide a new strategy for developing high performance polymer solar cells."

In this contribution, a benzene-cored star-shaped NFA, namely TPDI2-Se, was designed and synthesized for organic solar cells (OSCs). The NFA with smaller π-conjugated blades, namely TPDI-Se was synthesized for comparison. Using the commercially available PTB7-Th as the electron donor, a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.62% was obtained for TPDI-Se based OSCs. However, a much higher PCE of 8.59% was achieved for TPDI2-Se based devices owing to the π-extension in the peripheral panels. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of TPDI2-Se based OSCs is also superior to those of the parent NFA TPDI2 (PCE of 7.84%) and the blade moiety PDI2-Se (PCE of 6.61%) based ones. Additionally, a remarkable short-circuit current (Jsc) value of 17.21 mA/cm2 was obtained for TPDI2-Se based OSCs, which is among the highest Jsc values reported in PDI-based OSCs. These results argue that the so-called ""three in one"" molecule design strategy of π-extension, selenium incorporation and trimerization offers a robust approach to constructing high-performance PDI-based NFAs."

One of the main factors that determine the efficiency of the solar cells is the open-circuit voltage, VOC. In this work, we provide an analysis of the parameters affecting the VOC in a P3HT/PCBM complex. Electronic transitions, excited states, and electron transfer parameters are evaluated under the classical Marcus formalism via the time-dependent and unrestricted CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* methods. The charge-recombination driving force is found to mainly affect the charge-recombination rate constant and, in turn, VOC. Even though other parameters also determine the value of VOC like density of states, dimensions of the cell, and microstructure of the donor/acceptor interface, the current work highlights the understanding attained by modeling charge-transfer parameters. The analysis reported here encourage further quantum-chemical investigations in organic photovoltaics with the aim of estimating and improving VOC, such that more efficient organic solar cells may be predicted."

In this contribution, a cost-effective strategy of tailoring the length of alkyl side chain is utilized to design high-performing thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)-based large bandgap polymer donors PBDT-BiTPD(Cχ) (χ = 48, 52, 56), in which χ represents the alkyl side chain length in term of the total carbon number. A combination of light absorption, device, and morphology examinations make clear that the shorter alkyl side chains yield (i) higher crystallinity and more predominant face-on crystallite orientation in their neat and BHJ blend films, (ii) higher charge mobilities (6.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for C48 vs. 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for C56), and negligible charge recombination, consequently, (iii) significantly improved fill-factor (FF) and short current (JSC), while almost the same open circuit voltage (VOC) of ca. 0.82 V in their corresponding BHJ devices. In parallel, as alkyl side chain lengths decrease from C56 to C48, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) increased from 7.8% for C56 to 11.1% for C52, and further to 14.1% for C48 in their BHJ solar cells made with a narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptor Y6.

To achieve good performances, both donor and acceptor materials in OPVs need to have good extinction coefficients, high stabilities and good film morphologies. Since the donor plays a critical role as the absorber to solar photon flux, donor materials require wide optical absorption to match the solar spectrum. In this work the couple ED/EA in planar heterojunction was Tetracyano 4,4'-bis(9Hcarbazol-9-yl) biphenyl (TCC)/fullerene (C60 ). Optimum results are obtained when MoO3 alone is used as Hole Transporting Layer (HTL). The J/V characteristics do not exhibit S-shaped curves up to a TCC layer thickness of 15 nm, while they did when the HTL includes CuI. Theoretical study, complementary to the experimental study, shows that in the case of S-shaped curve the cell behaves as if it was made up of 2 diodes, one of which would be opposed to the flow of the photogenerated current. In the case of MoO3 HTL, i.e; without shaped curve, the optimum thickness is 13 nm, giving an efficiency η  = 2.30% with V oc  = 0.9 V, J sc  = 5.17 mA/cm2 and FF = 49%."

Interfacial engineering using suitable materials has been recognized as an attractive approach to tackle the above issues. We introduce here a zinc porphyrin-triazine-bodipy donor-π bridge-acceptor dye as a universal electron transfer mediator in both organic and perovskite solar cells. Thanks to its ""push-pull"" character, this dye enhances electron transfer from the absorber layer towards the electron selective contact thus improving the device photocurrent and efficiency.

Concurrently, by forming a hydrophobic network on the surface of metal oxide substrates it improves the nanomorphology of the photoactive overlayer and contributes to efficiency stabilization. The fabricated devices of both kinds preserved more than 85% of their efficiency upon exposure to ambient conditions for more than 600 hours without any encapsulation."

Time-resolved transient infrared spectra indicate the presence of an intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT-M and the electronic ground state of FCA, which is first observed here and which can suppress the internal conversion process. IT-M-based OSCs display an improved short-circuit current and fill factor after the addition of FCA. Thus, the power conversion efficiency is increased, particularly for devices with a large donor/acceptor ratio of 1:4, whose efficiency is increased by 56%.

We propose the simple model which examines the limitations of efficiency by analysis of geometrical aspects of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture. We calculate the effective area of the donor-acceptor border in the random mixture of the donor and the acceptor nanocrystals and further compare it with an ideal “brush architecture”. It turns out that in the BHJ architecture, this effective areas are very close to the value obtained in the “brush” one.

We herein report the synthesis, properties, and photovoltaic performance of three new air-stable, meso-substituted bacteriochlorins bearing a dioctylfluorenylethyne (denoted as LS-17), a dioctylaminophenylethynylanthrylethyne (LS-43), and a diarylaminoanthrylethyne (LS-45) as the electron-donating groups. Among these LS-bacteriochlorins, LS-17 displays sharp UV-visible absorption bands whereas LS-43 and LS-45 give rise to broadened and red-shifted absorptions. Electrochemical and DFT results suggest that the first oxidation and reduction reactions of these bacteriochlorins are consistent with the formation of the cation and anion radicals, respectively. For dye-sensitized solar cell applications, photovoltaic performance of the LS-45 cell achieves an overall efficiency of 6.04% under one-sun irradiation."

Under halogen lamp illumination with 100 mW/cm2 incident optical power density, the devices exhibits an open circuit voltage VOC = 0.45 V, a short circuit current density JSC between 2 and 2.5 mA/cm2 with a fill factor FF ≈ 50%, an external quantum efficiency (electrons/s over incident photons/s) EQE ≈ 5% and a power conversion efficiency of about 0.5%. Measurements of the photoelectrical characteristics with time are also reported, confirming that non encapsulated organic solar cells have limited stability in ambient atmosphere."

The hydrogen-bonded supramolecular array of barbiturated-oligothiophene molecules were directly visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells comprising CP3 and the fullerene PC61BM show a power conversion efficiency of 6.31%, which is markedly higher than a structural analogue CP4, which comprises a N-ethylrhodanine terminal acceptor unit incapable of participating in the same degree of self-assembly, supporting the impact of self-assembly in BHJ devices."
278,278,10.1002/adfm.201907432,,,Energy Transfer to a Stable Donor Suppresses Degradation in Organic Solar Cells,2020,"Despite many advances towards improving the stability of organic photovoltaic devices, environmental degradation under ambient conditions remains a challenging obstacle for future application. Particularly conventional systems employing fullerene derivatives are prone to oxidise under illumination, limiting their applicability. Herein, we report on the environmental stability of the small molecule donor DRCN5T together with the fullerene acceptor PC70BM. We find that this system exhibits exceptional device stability, mainly due to almost constant short-circuit current. By employing ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy we attribute this remarkable stability to two separate mechanisms: 1) DRCN5T exhibits high intrinsic resistance towards external factors, showing no signs of deterioration. 2) The highly sensitive PC70BM is stabilised against degradation by the presence of DRCN5T through ultrafast long-range energy transfer to the donor, rapidly quenching the fullerene excited states which are otherwise precursors for chemical oxidation. We propose that this photoprotective mechanism be utilised to improve the device stability of other systems, including non-fullerene acceptors and ternary blends."

We have synthesized a series of triphenylamine-based materials for use in low donor content devices with the electron accepting [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). The triphenylamine-based materials absorb light in the near UV enabling the PC70BM to be be the main light absorbing organic semiconducting material in the solar cell. It was found that the devices did not operate as classical Schottky junctions but rather photocurrent was generated by hole transfer from the photoexcited PC70BM to the triphenylamine-based donors. We found that replacing the methoxy surface groups with methyl groups on the donor material led to a decrease in hole mobility for the neat films, which was due to the methyl substituted materials having the propensity to aggregate. The thermodynamic drive to aggregate was advantageous for the performance of the low donor content (6 wt%) films. It was found that the 6 wt% donor devices generally gave higher performance than devices containing 50 wt% of the donor."
280,280,10.1016/j.jphotochem.2019.112139,,,Asymmetric push-pull small molecules with auxiliary electron-accepting unit for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells,2020,"Abstract Two small molecular donors (TPA-DPP and TPA-DPP-MDN) were designed with asymmetric push-pull structure, namely, donor-acceptor (D-A) and donor-acceptor-acceptor (D-A-A) systems. They were synthesized and investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, UV–vis spectra, X-ray diffraction, density functional theory (DFT) calculation, electrochemical and the photovoltaic (PV) measurement. The D-A-A architecture (TPA-DPP-MDN) exhibited lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of –5.18 eV, narrower optical band gap of 1.52 eV, better thermal stability and higher degree of ordered aggregation than these of the D-A system (TPA-DPP). TPA-DPP-MDN based PV device showed better performance with higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) than these of TPA-DPP based PV devices due to the low-lying HOMO level and wide spectral absorption range of TPA-DPP-MDN."
281,281,10.1016/j.orgel.2019.105463,,,Smart geometrical approach to intercalate a highly absorbing and quite resistive electron donor layer in ternary organic photovoltaic cells,2020,"Abstract Ternary organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have been shown to be a promising approach to increase cells efficiency through broadening of their absorption range. Often, ternary cells are based on a blend of two donors and one acceptor, the efficiency of planar ternary heterojunction being limited by the resistance of the three stacked layers. Here, we show that by depositing the intercalated layer through a grid we are able to decrease significantly the series resistance of the device, while the use of two donors allows improving the short circuit current and the efficiency of the organic photovoltaic cells. Electrical, optical and morphological studies show the ternary cell behaves like parallel OPVs. The first donor layer consists in an AlPcCl film, the acceptor layer is a C60 film while the central layer consists in a laboratory made molecule called MD2. If the MD2 layer absorbs strongly the light and permits to the both types of carrier to diffuse, its carriers mobility is small. Therefore, the discontinuities, due to the grid, of the MD2 intercalated layer allow improving the cells efficiency over-passing the corresponding binary cells performances."

By substituting an alkyl side chain with a chlorine (Cl) atom on the original benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR) molecule, the new small molecular donor, namely BTR-Cl, processes a more ordered liquid crystalline property, down-shifted molecular energy levels, and higher crystallinity. When blended with a non-fullerene acceptor Y6, which has a complementary absorption profile and well-matched energy levels but no liquid crystalline property, a prominent phase separation and optimal film morphology are obtained. As a result, a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.6% is achieved, taking a large step forward in ASM OSCs. Our results highlight the importance of crystallinity to phase separation, suggesting the great promise of liquid crystalline materials in OSCs."

In particular, the importance of charge dynamics is well recognized, and direct methods to observe charge generation, transfer, and recombination processes are required. Here, we describe tip-synchronized time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy. Numerical modeling clarifies that the tip-synchronized method provides temporal resolution with the timescale of the cantilever oscillation cycle. This method enables us to resolve sub-microsecond charge migration on the surface. The recombination of photo-excited carriers in a bilayer organic photovoltaic thin film is observed as a movie with a 0.3 µs frame step time resolution. Analysis of the images shows that the carrier lifetime is 2.3 µs near the donor/acceptor interface. The tip-synchronized method increases the range of time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy, paving the way for studies of nanoscale charge dynamics.An understanding of charge dynamics and direct observations of charge generation, transfer and recombination is important to help develop and apply various materials for electronic devices. The authors develop a time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy technique to visually observe charge migration on the nanoscale at a sub-microsecond timeframe."

In order to study the effect of alkylthio substituent and different terminal groups on photovoltaic properties, a series of small molecules were designed and synthesized. Molecule LS0 was modified by alkyl as side chains and 2-ethylrhodanine as terminal groups while LS1a, LS1b, LS2, LS3 were substituted with alkylthio side chains and capped with different terminal groups of 2-ethylrhodanine, 2-hexylrhodanine, 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate, and 1,3-indanedione, respectively. Compared with LS0, alkylthio substituted LS1a exhibited higher HOMO and LUMO due to more planar backbone. Capped with different terminal groups, LS1a, LS1b, LS2, and LS3 showed the different optical and photovoltaic properties. Among these molecules, OSCs based on LS1b showed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.38% while others showed PCE of 7.87%, 6.52%, 6.52%, and 4.65% for LS0, LS1a, LS2, and LS3, respectively. The results demonstrated that rational selecting side chains and terminal groups could be a promising strategy to promote the performance of small molecule-based OSCs."

In this work, two medium bandgap 2D-conjugated copolymers J61 and J71 with varied side chains were utilized as donor to construct efficient all-PSCs with the typical electron-withdrawing polymer N2200 as acceptor. Eventually, moderate photovoltaic performance was obtained for J61:N2200 device with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.58% and FF of 60.18%. While the J71:N2200-based all-PSCs delivered an outstanding PCE of 9.31% with an unprecedented FF of 78.00%. To the best of our knowledge, such an FF of 78% represents a record value for binary all-PSCs systems, which demonstrates that the all-PSCs can realize excellent FF comparable to other PSCs systems. The favorable blends morphology, molecular orientation, balanced charge transport and suppressed recombination together contributed to the remarkable photovoltaic performance of J71:N2200 devices. In addition, relatively weak thickness-dependence of photovoltaic property and excellent long-term device stabilities (in N2 and air, respectively) were observed for the J71:N2200 all-PSCs. These results reveal that J71 with trialkylsilyl side chains is a promising polymer donor candidate for developing high performance all-PSCs for future practical application."

In this work, two narrow band gap donor–acceptor conjugated polymers based on boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as the electron-deficient unit were developed as the electron donor to combine with a NDI-polymer acceptor in order to significantly improve the photoresponse in the NIR region. More importantly, we found that methyl substitution on the BODIPY segment played an important role in charge transport in these polymers. When methyl units were attached to the α-position of BODIPY, the polymer PMBBDT exhibited high-lying energy levels, improved crystallinity, and dramatically high hole mobility compared to the polymer PBBDT without methyl substitution. Consequently, the power conve..."

We then incorporate a similar acceptor unit benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) into the polymeric backbone of PBN-Cl to tune its photovoltaic performance, and a significantly higher PCE of 14.05% is achieved from the random polymer PBN-Cl-B80 containing 80% BDD unit. The enhanced PCE of the PBN-Cl-B80-based device mainly relies on the higher FF value, resulting from the improved charge mobility properties, reduced bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination, and more appropriate phase separation. The results demonstrate a feasible strategy to tune the photovoltaic performance of polymer donors by constructing random polymer with a compatible component."

Hole mobility, steady-state photoluminescence, thin-film surface morphology on top of the perovskite layer, and photovoltaic performance for the YC series were systematically investigated and compared with those of Spiro-OMeTAD. It was found that YC-1 exhibited more efficient hole transport and extraction characteristics at the perovskite/HTM interface. Meanwhile, the film of YC-1 showed a homogeneous and dense capping layer coverage on the perovskite layer without any pinholes, leading to the improvement of the fill factor and open circuit voltage.

Here, we present a study of photoinduced charge transfer processes between electron donor and acceptor organic nanocrystals as part of a pathfinding effort to develop robust and efficient organic nanocrystalline materials for photovoltaic applications. For this purpose, we utilized nanocrystals of perylenediimides as the electron acceptors and nanocrystalline copper phthalocyanine as the electron donor. Three different configurations of donor–acceptor heterojunctions were prepared. Charge transfer in the heterojunctions was studied with Kelvin probe force microscopy under laser or white light excitation.

Sensitized photon upconversion that converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones via triplet fusion holds great potential in augmentation of photovoltaic devices and photocatalysis. Conventional requirement of exothermic triplet-triplet energy transfer in sensitized upconversion constrains the development of upconversion donor-acceptor pairs. We demonstrate an upconversion system by utilizing a triplet energy-deficient donor within a triplet acceptor matrix, in which efficient thermally activated triplet-triplet energy transfer overcoming an energy barrier of up to 180 meV and an over 5% upconversion quantum yield in the solid state are achieved upon 635 nm irradiation at 195 mW/cm2. The effective solid-state upconversion through thermally activated triplet-triplet energy transfer establishes a new pathway to extract triplet energy from low-lying sensitizers, transcending traditional restriction in matching components energy level."

Several organic and inorganic compounds, most of which are solution processed or thermally evaporated, are used for this purpose. Features such as energy level in relation to the donor material’s thermal and mechanical stability and processability are among the aspects that reflect the performance of these materials as electron acceptors or electrodes. Moreover, the donor/acceptor interface directly reflects the photovoltaic response. Therefore, device engineering efforts have been exerted to achieve proper acceptor distribution along the bulk of thin films or improve the compatibility at the donor/acceptor interface. This review is divided into subsections concerning the use of PDI molecules, PDI dimers/trimers/tetramers, bilayer devices, routes to improve the donor/acceptor interface, PDI-based polymers and energy harvesting. The reports show that PDI derivatives are suitable candidates for replacing fullerene derivatives in OSCs with reduced production cost and improved stability. Moreover, new PDI composites with graphene are promising cathodes for sodium batteries. Therefore, PDI derivatives are low cost and multifunctional materials employed to produce optoelectronic devices with numerous purposes."

In this work, three dithienocyclopentacarbazole-based nonfullerene acceptors (HCN-C8, HCN-C16, and H2FCN-C16) have been designed and synthesized to investigate the effects of side chain and fluorination on the photovoltaic properties of nonfullerene acceptors.

In this study we explore new avenues of shifting the light absorber through rational design of the π-spacers in the Donor–π-spacer–Acceptor dyes. That is, to construct high performing new dyes with fixed donor (DCPA) and acceptor (PMID) from appropriate π-building units of fluorene, EDOT and thiophene. These three π-units form various combinations of the π-conjugate spacers for new dyes. We focus on the development of the relationship between the three building units of π-spacers to construct new DCPA–π-spacer–PMID dyes and their UV–vis spectra in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The latter (i.e., UV–vis spectra) are calculated using quantum mechanical time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods. This set of nine new organic dyes has been employed to develop augmented intelligence (AI). We discovered that repeating the fluorene (πO) unit alone in the π-spacer, such as OP100, OP200 and OP300 dyes, will lead to hyperchromic enhancement of the donor spectral band in the UV region of ca. 300 nm, with limited impact on the major spectral band at 500 nm which is stemmed from the acceptor (PMID). To maximize the UV–vis absorption, more efficient π-spacers for this class of dyes are constructed from mixtures of the fluorene (πO) and EDOT (πP) units, such as πO-πP-πO (OP210) or as πO-πP-πO-πP (OP220). The information obtained is useful to elucidate new dyes with desired properties with appropriate UV–vis spectra for future machine learning (ML)."

In particular, we found that incorporating 10% of BDTTBO-BT to form the PTB7-TH: BDTTBO-BT: PC71BM ternary blend (active layer) device could improve the power conversion efficiency to 10.4% from 9.0% for the binary blend of PTB7-TH: PC71BM device—a relative increase of 15%. We examined the packing orientations of the PBDTTBO: PTB7-TH:PC71BM ternary blend films using synchrotron two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering, and found that the incorporation of 10% relatively higher crystallinity PBDTTBO-BT, PBDTTBO-BzT or PBDTTBO-TT not only altered the packing orientation of PTB7-TH substantially but also reduced PC71BM cluster size in the ternary blend system, as compared to that in the case of PTB7-TH with PC71BM binary blend, thereby providing more pathways for electrons and thus enhancing the carrier transport in the ternary blend, as evidenced by the carrier mobility."

Energy levels of the donor and acceptor moieties are tailored to facilitate splitting of the excited state into a lower-lying charge-transfer (CT) state, mimicking the functionality of a donor–acceptor interface for charge generation, thus resulting in long-lived charge separation. Ultrafast electronic energy transfer (ET) from the donor followed by fast hole (back)transfer from the acceptor populates the molecules’ CT states. However, the CT efficiency is found to be close to unity, independent of the donor or acceptor photoexcitation. The ratio of CT and recombination rates, which reflects the population of CT states, increases with the oligophenylene spacer length for both direct hole transfer and hole transfer following ET, boosting the population of CT states under continuous excitation..."

Rapid advances have been made in the development of n-type polymers consisting of various electron acceptor units for all-PSCs. So far, more than 200 n-type polymer acceptors have been reported. In the last seven years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-PSCs rapidly increased and has now surpassed 10%, meaning they are approaching the performance of state-of-the-art solar cells using fullerene derivatives as acceptors. This review discusses the design criteria, synthesis, and structure-property relationships of n-type polymers that have been used in all-PSCs. Additionally, it highlights the recent progress toward photovoltaic performance enhancement of binary, ternary, and tandem all-PSCs.

The acceptors include nonfused core (thiophene-benzotriazole-thiophene) and fused core (dithienopyrrolobenzotriazole, DTBT). Systematical investigation reveals that the acceptor greatly influences the absorption, energy level, hole transfer and extraction, and photovoltaic performances of the HTMs. The dopant-free HTMs DT1-2 with DTBT core exhibit better hole transfer and extraction performance, and then obtain better photovoltaic performance than that of BTA1-2. Especially, the PSC using DT2 without any dopants obtains a power conversion efficiency of 13.22%, which is outperforming than that of spiro-OMeTAD (10.41%). When doping with Li-TFSI/TBP (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide/tert-butylpyridine), DT2-based cell achieves an improved efficiency of 15.77%. In addition, the different alkoxyl chain lengths on triphenylamine has a significant impact on the conductivity, hole mobility, hole extraction, and photovoltaic performance. The stability testing of the PSCs shows that the four HTMs based devices display improved stability than spiro-OMeTAD. These results certify that the fused acceptor core DTBT is a promising core for efficient D-A-D type HTMs towards PSCs."

The structure, photophysical and electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic properties of the three sensitizers were investigated in detail. The results indicate that the donor 11,12-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-11,12-dihydroindolo[2,3-a]carbazole with two branched alkyl chains is effective in inhibiting the intermolecular π−π aggregation effects, and the auxiliary alkyl chains in the π-bridge cause the DC3-based DSSCs to exhibit higher open circuit voltages than that of the devices based on dye DC2. Among all of the devices fabricated with the dyes, the DC3-based cells without chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) exhibit the best photovoltaic performance, with a short-circuit current density of 10.98 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 752 mV and a fill factor of 0.725, corresponding to a highest power conversion efficiency of 5.98% in liquid electrolyte."

However, SM–fullerene blends commonly suffer severe voltage losses. In general, devices that reach open-circuit voltages (VOC) > 1 V yield low photocurrents in BHJ solar cells with fullerene acceptors (e.g., PC71BM) and modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this contribution, we report on the design, synthesis, and BHJ device characteristics of a new SM donor, 2F-DRCN5T, yielding a VOC of up to 1.10 V with PC71BM as the fullerene acceptor, while maintaining PCEs > 7% (over 8% achieved upon solvent-vapor-annealing (SVA) treatment). The negligible energy loss during charge generation (ΔECT), the deep-lying HOMO of 2F-DRCN5T inferred from its large ionization potential (IP), the high charge-transfer-state energy (ECT) of the blend, and a reduced nonradiative voltage loss account for the high VOC achieved in BHJ solar cells."

We characterized these small molecules and further investigated the optical, electrochemical, morphological and photovoltaic properties.

DIO additive promotes the formation of nanoscopically well-connected molecular domains in the active blend film. A device based on (1% DIO, 1:1) 2D-NDT(Ester)2:PC71BM exhibited highest the efficiency of 1.22% with a short-circuit density (Jsc) of 3.75 mA/cm2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V and fill factor (FF) of 35.50. Similarly for (1% DIO, 1:3) 2D-NDT(Amide)2:PC71BM device efficiency of 0.55%, with Jsc of 2.36 mA/cm2, Voc of 0.64 V and FF of 36.95 was observed. Whereas for (1:2) 2D-NDT(TPD)2:PC71BM device, due to the improper blending and phase separation between donor and acceptor efficiency restricted to 0.33% with Jsc of 1.66 mA/cm2, Voc of 0.73 V and FF of 27.2."

The introduction of selenophene can increase crystallinity due to the metalloid nature of selenium and thus facilitate charge transport. Chlorination can tune the energy levels and induce strong aggregation due to its unique features. A non-chlorinated polymer with selenophene, PBT3TSe, shows a highly crystalline structure and a dominant face-on orientation, consequently attaining a high short-circuit current (JSC). Chlorinated PBT3TClSe displays synergy between the advantages of chlorination and selenophene to achieve elevated photovoltaic performance, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 9.89% in PC71BM-based devices. Interestingly, chlorination has an important influence on morphology of the polymer and polymer blend films, resulting in a severe aggregation and mixed face-on and edge-on orientation in the blend film. But the sufficient intermingling of donor..."

Herein, we demonstrate that the molecular ordering and orientation of the n-type small-molecule acceptor COi8DFIC can be tuned from flat-on and edge-on lamellar crystalline to H- and J-type π-π stacking during the solution-casting process, resulting in broadened photon absorption and fine phase separation with the electron donor PTB7-Th. This favorable morphology with face-on π-π stacked electron donors and acceptors promotes efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface, together with enhanced and balanced carrier mobility. The enhanced short-circuit current density and fill factor lead to the achievement of a maximum PCE of 13.8% in binary, single-junction PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC non-fullerene polymer solar cells while also exhibiting superior stability."
376,376,10.1002/chem.201804999,,,Peculiar Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Porphyrin–Fullerene Akamptisomers,2019,"Porphyrin-fullerene dyads are promising candidates for organic photovoltaic devices. The electron-transfer (ET) properties of the molecular devices depend significantly on the mutual position of the donor and acceptor. Recently, a new type of molecular isomerism (akamptisomerism) has been discovered. In the present study, we explore how photoinduced ET can be modulated by passing from one akamptisomer to another. To this aim, four akamptisomers of the quinoxalinoporphyrin-[60]fullerene complex are selected for computational study. The most striking finding is that, depending on the isomer, the porphyrin unit in the dyad can act as either electron donor or electron acceptor. Thus, the stereoisomeric diversity allows one to change the direction of ET between the porphyrin and fullerene moieties. To understand the effect of akamptisomerism on the photoinduced ET processes, a detailed analysis of initial and final states involved in the ET is performed. The computed rate for charge separation is estimated to be in the region of 1-10 ns-1 . The formation of a long-living quinoxalinoporphyrin anion radical species is predicted."

The impact of the different donors with additional methoxy group on the photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties are studied. The electron transfer kinetics are investigated by transient absorption spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. At a fixed VOC, the electron lifetime increases in the order of donors: julolidine"
387,387,10.1002/chem.201805405,,,ABC–ABC-Type Directly meso–meso Linked Porphyrin Dimers,2019,"Covalently linked porphyrin oligomers are attractive because of their extended π-conjugated systems. Among various porphyrin oligomers, directly meso-meso linked porphyrin oligomers exhibit unique photophysical properties due to their strong exciton couplings derived from the alternative orthogonal geometry of the porphyrins. Although their structural and electronic properties can be greatly altered by substituents at meso positions, it is still difficult to introduce different substituents at the meso positions. Thus, it is a challenge to develop general synthetic methodologies for functional porphyrin dimers and oligomers with different substituents at the meso positions. Herein, a general synthetic strategy for ABC-ABC-type directly meso-meso linked porphyrin dimers by stepwise functionalization starting from 10,15,20-meso-free 5-substituted porphyrin as building block is established. A meso-ABC-ABC-type meso-meso-linked donor-π-acceptor-type porphyrin dimer was prepared and exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (7.91 %) ever reported for dye-sensitized solar cells based on dimeric orthogonal donor-π-acceptor-type organic sensitizers. This synthetic strategy will provide useful guidance for the rational design of functional porphyrin dimers and oligomers for diverse applications."

Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in multi-chromophore systems is controlled by a subtle interplay of donor and acceptor properties and solvent effects. In the present study, we explore how PET of fullerene [C60]-Zn-porphyrin-BODIPY triads can be modulated by passing from non-polar to polar media. To this end we perform a computational study of this complex using the DFT/TDDFT method. We find that the stabilization energy of charge transfer states by a polar medium depends significantly on whether the BODIPY moiety acts as an electron donor or an electron acceptor. To understand this effect of the environment, a detailed analysis of the initial and final states of the ET reactions is performed. We show that additional deactivation channels of the porphyrin excited state may come into play as solvent polarity increases."

In this contribution, we used drift-diffusion semiconductor modeling to investigate the mechanism governing the charge transport in TiO2/Ga2O3/Cu2O and TiO2/Al:ZnO/Cu2O heterojunctions. The simulated photovoltage 0.9 V for TiO2/Ga2O3/Cu2O agrees well with the measured value of 1.0 V and the governing mechanism is identified to be thermionic emission of electrons across the Ga2O3/TiO2 interface. By modeling an optimized increase in Ga2O3 donor concentration, a photovoltage improvement of only 0.1 V is achievable, whereas further optimizing the electron affinity of Ga2O3 may lead to more significant improvement approaching 0.7 V. The optimized electron affinity of Ga2O3 enabled a simulated photovoltage of 1.6 V, close to the theoretical limit for Cu2O with a 2.17 eV bandgap energy. Additionally, we find that simulations can reproduce the measured photovoltage of TiO2/Al:ZnO/Cu2O only when an interface recombination layer at the Al:ZnO/Cu2O interface is included in the model. Our findings enable detailed understanding of the charge transport mechanism in Cu2O heterojunctions and offer various design directions for further photovoltage improvement."

Some CNs have shown interesting electrochemical, photophysical and electrocatalytic properties and have been used in energy and sustainability applications. This study focuses on the covalent functionalization of carbon nanoonion (CNO) surfaces with ferrocene moieties to obtain donor–acceptor systems involving CNOs as acceptors. The systems were synthesized and characterized by infrared, Raman, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption and electrochemical measurements. The HOMO–LUMO levels were calculated to evaluate the possibility of using these systems in photoactive devices. In this study, for the first time, the CNO-based derivatives were applied as acceptors in the active layer of photovoltaic devices. This study is the first to use large CNO-based derivatives as acceptors in organic photovoltaic devices, and a power conversion efficiency as high as 1.89% was achieved."

Here we used simple and cost-effective techniques of thermal annealing and solvent vapour annealing to increase the exciton diffusion coefficient and exciton diffusion length in two liquid crystalline electron donor materials BQR and BTR. We found that the three-dimensional exciton diffusion length increased to ∼40 nm upon annealing in both materials. Grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements show an increase of crystallite size to ∼37 nm in both materials after thermal annealing. We determined an average domain size of these materials in the blends with PC71BM using diffusion-limited fluorescence quenching and found that it increased to 31 nm in BTR PC71BM blends and to 60 nm in BQR PC71BM blends. Our results provide understanding of how annealing improves device efficiency.

PffBB-n exhibited not only strong and wide absorption but also controllable aggregation behavior in solution and thin films, in which aggregation behavior was greatly influenced by the length of alkyl side chains attached, temperature applied, and solvent used. Aggregation-induced spectral broadening further extended the absorption cut-off to ∼780 nm in thin films, leading to a narrow optical band gap of ∼1.6 eV. Because of the strong aggregation strength, PffBB-n equipped with long alkyl side chains shows enhanced ordered molecular packing and good crystallinity as revealed by X-ray diffraction studies.
