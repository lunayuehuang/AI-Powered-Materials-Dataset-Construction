2,10.1002/adma.201800561,2018.0,30 Years of Lithium‐Ion Batteries,"Over the past 30 years, significant commercial and academic progress has been made on Li‐based battery technologies. From the early Li‐metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li‐ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li‐based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next‐generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium‐ion battery chemistries."

13,10.1002/aenm.202101126,2021.0,Fast Charging of Lithium‐Ion Batteries: A Review of Materials Aspects,"Fast charging is considered to be a key requirement for widespread economic success of electric vehicles. Current lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) offer high energy density enabling sufficient driving range, but take considerably longer to recharge than traditional vehicles. Multiple properties of the applied anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials influence the fast‐charging ability of a battery cell. In this review, the physicochemical basics of different material combinations are considered in detail, identifying the transport of lithium inside the electrodes as the crucial rate‐limiting steps for fast‐charging. Lithium diffusion within the active materials inherently slows down the charging process and causes high overpotentials. In addition, concentration polarization by slow lithium‐ion transport within the electrolyte phase in the porous electrodes also limits the charging rate. Both kinetic effects are responsible for lithium plating observed on graphite anodes. Conclusions drawn from potential and concentration profiles within LIB cells are complemented by extensive literature surveys on anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials—including solid‐state batteries. The advantages and disadvantages of typical LIB materials are analyzed, resulting in suggestions for optimum properties on the material and electrode level for fast‐charging applications. Finally, limitations on the cell level are discussed briefly as well."

19,10.1021/CR020731C,2004.0,Lithium batteries and cathode materials.,"In the previous paper Ralph Brodd and Martin Winter described the different kinds of batteries and fuel cells. In this paper I will describe lithium batteries in more detail, building an overall foundation for the papers that follow which describe specific components in some depth and usually with an emphasis on the materials behavior. The lithium battery industry is undergoing rapid expansion, now representing the largest segment of the portable battery industry and dominating the computer, cell phone, and camera power source industry. However, the present secondary batteries use expensive components, which are not in sufficient supply to allow the industry to grow at the same rate in the next decade. Moreover, the safety of the system is questionable for the large-scale batteries needed for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). Another battery need is for a high-power system that can be used for power tools, where only the environmentally hazardous Ni/ Cd battery presently meets the requirements. A battery is a transducer that converts chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. It contains an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte. The anode, in the case of a lithium battery, is the source of lithium ions. The cathode is the sink for the lithium ions and is chosen to optimize a number of parameters, discussed below. The electrolyte provides for the separation of ionic transport and electronic transport, and in a perfect battery the lithium ion transport number will be unity in the electrolyte. The cell potential is determined by the difference between the chemical potential of the lithium in the anode and cathode, ∆G ) -EF. As noted above, the lithium ions flow through the electrolyte whereas the electrons generated from the reaction, Li ) Li+ + e-, go through the external circuit to do work. Thus, the electrode system must allow for the flow of both lithium ions and electrons. That is, it must be both a good ionic conductor and an electronic conductor. As discussed below, many electrochemically active materials are not good electronic conductors, so it is necessary to add an electronically conductive material such as carbon * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Nevertheless the insertion/extraction reaction proceeds via a two‐phase process, and a reversible loss in capacity with increasing current density appears to be associated with a diffusion‐limited transfer of lithium across the two‐phase interface. Electrochemical extraction of lithium from isostructural (M = Mn, Co, or Ni) with an electrolyte was not possible; but successful extraction of lithium from was accomplished with maximum oxidation of the occurring at x = 0.5.

In order to further increase the energy density of batteries and overcome the capacity limitations (<250 mAh g-1) of inorganic cathode materials, it is imperative to explore new cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries. Organic compounds including organic carbonyl, radicals, and organosulfides are promising as they have advantages of high capacities, abundant resources, and tunable structures. In the 1980s, a few organosulfides, in particular organodisulfides, as cathode materials were studied to a certain extent in rechargeable lithium batteries. However, they showed low capacities and poor cycling performance, which made them unappealing then in comparison to transition metal oxide cathode materials. As a result, organosulfides have not been extensively studied like other cathode materials including organic carbonyls and radicals. In recent years, organosulfides with long sulfur chains (e.g., trisulfide, tetrasulfide, pentasulfide, etc.) in the structures have been receiving more attention in conjunction with the development of lithium-sulfur batteries. As a major class of sulfur derivatives, they have versatile structures and unique properties in comparison with elemental sulfur. In this Account, we first generalize the working principles of organosulfides in lithium batteries. We then discuss organosulfide molecules, which have precise lithiation sites and tunable capacities. The organic functional groups can provide additional benefits, such as discharge voltage and energy efficiency enhancement by phenyl groups and cycling stability improvement by N-heterocycles. Furthermore, replacing sulfur by selenium in these compounds can improve their electrochemical properties due to the high electronic conductivity and low bond energy associated with selenium. We list organosulfide polymers consisting of phenyl rings, N-heterocycles, or aliphatic segments. Organosulfides as electrolyte additives or components for forming a solid-electrolyte interphase layer on lithium metal anode are also presented. Carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide can enhance the battery performance of organosulfide cathodes. We discuss the synthesis methods for polysulfide molecules and polymers. Finally, we show the advantages of organosulfides over sulfur as cathode materials in lithium batteries. This Account provides a summary of recent development, in-depth analysis of structure-performance relationship, and guidance for future development of organosulfides as promising cathode materials for next generation rechargeable lithium batteries."

However, the application of Li–S batteries is challenged by several obstacles, including their short life and low sulfur utilization, which become more serious when sulfur loading is increased to the practically accepted level above 3–5 mg cm−2. More and more efforts have been made recently to overcome the barriers toward commercially viable Li–S batteries with a high sulfur loading.

However, they often suffer from sluggish conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) during the charge/discharge process. Single nickel (Ni) atoms on nitrogen‐doped graphene (Ni@NG) with Ni–N4 structure are prepared and introduced to modify the separators of Li–S batteries. The oxidized Ni sites of the Ni–N4 structure act as polysulfide traps, efficiently accommodating polysulfide ion electrons by forming strong Sx 2−⋅⋅⋅NiN bonding. Additionally, charge transfer between the LiPS and oxidized Ni sites endows the LiPS on Ni@NG with low free energy and decomposition energy barrier in an electrochemical process, accelerating the kinetic conversion of LiPS during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the large binding energy of LiPS on Ni@NG also shows its ability to immobilize the LiPS and further suppresses the undesirable shuttle effect. Therefore, a Li–S battery based on a Ni@NG modified separator exhibits excellent rate performance and stable cycling life with only 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. It affords fresh insights for developing single‐atom catalysts to accelerate the kinetic conversion of LiPS for highly stable Li–S batteries."

Although solid electrolytes are believed to be mechanically strong enough to prevent lithium dendrites from propagating, various reports today still show cell failure due to lithium dendrit growth at room temperature. While cell parameters such as current density, electrolyte porosity, and interfacial properties have been investigated, mechanical properties of lithium metal and the role of applied stack pressure on the shorting behavior are still poorly understood. Here, failure mechanisms of lithium metal are investigated in all‐solid‐state batteries as a function of stack pressure, and in situ characterization of the interfacial and morphological properties of the buried lithium is conducted in solid electrolytes. It is found that a low stack pressure of 5 MPa allows reliable plating and stripping in a lithium symmetric cell for more than 1000 h, and a Li | Li6PS5Cl | LiNi0.80Co0.15Al0.05O2 full cell, plating more than 4 µm of lithium per charge, is able to cycle over 200 cycles at room temperature. These results suggest the possibility of enabling the lithium metal anode in all‐solid‐state batteries at reasonable stack pressures."

Herein, we develop in situ NMR metrology to study “anode-free” lithium metal batteries where lithium is plated directly onto a bare copper current collector from a LiFePO4 cathode. The methodology allows inactive or “dead lithium” formation during plating and stripping of lithium in a full-cell lithium metal battery to be tracked: dead lithium and SEI formation can be quantified by NMR and their relative rates of formation are here compared in carbonate and ether-electrolytes. Little-to-no dead Li was observed when FEC is used as an additive. The bulk magnetic susceptibility effects arising from the paramagnetic lithium metal were used to distinguish between different surface coverages of lithium deposits. The amount of lithium metal was monitored during rest periods, and lithium metal dissolution (corrosion) was observed in all electrolytes, even during the periods when the battery is not in use, i.e., when no current is flowing, demonstrating that dissolution of lithium remains a critical issue for lithium metal batteries. The high rate of corrosion is attributed to SEI formation on both lithium metal and copper (and Cu+, Cu2+ reduction). Strategies to mitigate the corrosion are explored, the work demonstrating that both polymer coatings and the modification of the copper surface chemistry help to stabilize the lithium metal surface."

In this paper, indirect health indicators (IHIs) are extracted from the curves of voltage, current, and temperature in the process of charging and discharging lithium-ion batteries, which respond to the battery capacity degradation process. A few reasonable indicators are selected as the inputs of SOH prediction by the grey relation analysis method. The short-term SOH prediction is carried out by combining the Gaussian process regression (GPR) method with probability predictions. Then, considering that there is a certain mapping relationship between SOH and RUL, three IHIs and the present SOH value are utilized to predict RUL of lithium-ion batteries through the GPR model.

Lithium, a critical element in LIBs, might encounter a potential supply crisis in the future. The irregular distribution of lithium mineral resources in countries and the unequal concentration in brine reserves also causes lithium extraction to be of critical importance. Today lithium is mainly recovered from minerals (especially spodumene) by acid, alkaline, and chlorination processes, and from brines by crystallization, solvent extraction, and ion-exchange processes. Regarding the secondary resources, i.e., recycling the spent LIBs, the recycling process consists of dismantling the LIBs, in some cases the separation of the cathode and anode materials, leaching of shredded material, and separation and recovery of metals. Nonetheless, the industry standard for recycling of LIBs currently is the pyrometallurgy processes, mostly are focused on the base metals recovery, such as cobalt and nickel, rather than lithium. Varying compositions of batteries for different applications require the development of a suitable and sustainable recycling process to recover metals from all types of LIBs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of lithium recovery processes that have already been studied and are currently in industrial practice, in the hope of providing some inspirations to explore new technologies for sustainable recovery of lithium from minerals, brines and LIBs."

The existing RUL prediction techniques for lithium-ion batteries are inefficient for learning the long-term dependencies among the capacity degradations. This paper investigates deep-learning-enabled battery RUL prediction. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed to learn the long-term dependencies among the degraded capacities of lithium-ion batteries. The LSTM RNN is adaptively optimized using the resilient mean square back-propagation method, and a dropout technique is used to address the overfitting problem. The developed LSTM RNN is able to capture the underlying long-term dependencies among the degraded capacities and construct an explicitly capacity-oriented RUL predictor, whose long-term learning performance is contrasted to the support vector machine model, the particle filter model, and the simple RNN model. Monte Carlo simulation is combined to generate a probabilistic RUL prediction. Experimental data from multiple lithium-ion cells at two different temperatures is deployed for model construction, verification, and comparison. The developed method is able to predict the battery's RUL independent of offline training data, and when some offline data is available, the RUL can be predicted earlier than in the traditional methods."

The rational management of polysulfides is of profound significance for high‐efficiency sulfur electrochemistry. Here, the key roles of polysulfides are discussed, with regard to their status, behavior, and their correspondingimpact on the lithium–sulfur system.

94,10.1002/anie.201712702,2018.0,Electrolyte Additives for Lithium Metal Anodes and Rechargeable Lithium Metal Batteries: Progress and Perspectives.,"Lithium metal (Li0 ) rechargeable batteries (LMBs), such as systems with a Li0 anode and intercalation and/or conversion type cathode, lithium-sulfur (Li-S), and lithium-oxygen (O2 )/air (Li-O2 /air) batteries, are becoming increasingly important for electrifying the modern transportation system, with the aim of sustainable mobility. Although some rechargeable LMBs (e.g. Li0 /LiFePO4 batteries from Bolloré Bluecar, Li-S batteries from OXIS Energy and Sion Power) are already commercially viable in niche applications, their large-scale deployment is hampered by a number of formidable challenges, including growth of lithium dendrites, electrolyte instability towards high voltage intercalation-type cathodes, the poor electronic and ionic conductivities of sulfur (S8 ) and O2 , as well as their corresponding reduction products (e.g. Li2 S and Li2 O), dissolution, and shuttling of polysulfide (PS) intermediates. This leads to a short lifecycle, low coulombic/energy efficiency, poor safety, and a high self-discharge rate. The use of electrolyte additives is considered one of the most economical and effective approaches for circumventing these problems. This Review gives an overview of the various functional additives that are being applied and aims to stimulate new avenues for the practical realization of these appealing devices."
95,10.1002/aenm.201802768,2018.0,Conductive and Catalytic Triple‐Phase Interfaces Enabling Uniform Nucleation in High‐Rate Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"Rechargeable lithium–sulfur batteries have attracted tremendous scientific attention owing to their superior energy density. However, the sulfur electrochemistry involves multielectron redox reactions and complicated phase transformations, while the final morphology of solid‐phase Li2S precipitates largely dominate the battery's performance. Herein, a triple‐phase interface among electrolyte/CoSe2/G is proposed to afford strong chemisorption, high electrical conductivity, and superb electrocatalysis of polysulfide redox reactions in a working lithium–sulfur battery. The triple‐phase interface effectively enhances the kinetic behaviors of soluble lithium polysulfides and regulates the uniform nucleation and controllable growth of solid Li2S precipitates at large current density. Therefore, the cell with the CoSe2/G functional separator delivers an ultrahigh rate cycle at 6.0 C with an initial capacity of 916 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention of 459 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles, and a stable operation of high sulfur loading electrode (2.69–4.35 mg cm−2). This work opens up a new insight into the energy chemistry at interfaces to rationally regulate the electrochemical redox reactions, and also inspires the exploration of related energy storage and conversion systems based on multielectron redox reactions."

In this paper, a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) architecture of the DDRN is designed for both state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) estimation. Unlike other techniques, this estimation strategy is subject to the global feedback theorem (GFT) which increases both computational intelligence and robustness while maintaining reasonable simplicity. The proposed technique requires no model or knowledge of battery's internal parameters, but rather uses the battery's voltage, charge/discharge currents, and ambient temperature variations to accurately estimate battery's SOC and SOH simultaneously. The presented method is evaluated experimentally using two different batteries namely lithium iron phosphate (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{LiFePO}_4$</tex-math></inline-formula>) and lithium titanate (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{LTO}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) both subject to dynamic charge and discharge current profiles and change in ambient temperature. Results highlight the robustness of this method to battery's nonlinear dynamic nature, hysteresis, aging, dynamic current profile, and parametric uncertainties. The simplicity and robustness of this method make it suitable and effective for EVs’ battery management system (BMS)."
97,10.1126/science.aak9991,2017.0,"Rechargeable nickel–3D zinc batteries: An energy-dense, safer alternative to lithium-ion","Zinc can compete with lithium Although lithium-based batteries are ubiquitous, there are still challenges related to their longevity and safety, as well as concerns about material availability. Aqueous rechargeable batteries based on zinc might provide an alternative, but they have been plagued by the formation of dendrites during cycling. Parker et al. show that when zinc is formed into three-dimensional sponges, it can be used with nickel to form primary batteries that allow for deep discharge. Alternatively, the sponges can be used to produce secondary batteries that can be cycled thousands of times and can compete with lithium ion cells. Science, this issue p. 415 A nickel–zinc battery may provide a much safer option to lithium-based cells with comparable performance. The next generation of high-performance batteries should include alternative chemistries that are inherently safer to operate than nonaqueous lithium-based batteries. Aqueous zinc-based batteries can answer that challenge because monolithic zinc sponge anodes can be cycled in nickel–zinc alkaline cells hundreds to thousands of times without undergoing passivation or macroscale dendrite formation. We demonstrate that the three-dimensional (3D) zinc form-factor elevates the performance of nickel–zinc alkaline cells in three fields of use: (i) >90% theoretical depth of discharge (DODZn) in primary (single-use) cells, (ii) >100 high-rate cycles at 40% DODZn at lithium-ion–commensurate specific energy, and (iii) the tens of thousands of power-demanding duty cycles required for start-stop microhybrid vehicles."
98,10.1002/aenm.201200026,2012.0,Electrode Materials for Rechargeable Sodium‐Ion Batteries: Potential Alternatives to Current Lithium‐Ion Batteries,"Lithium (Li)‐ion batteries (LIB) have governed the current worldwide rechargeable battery market due to their outstanding energy and power capability. In particular, the LIB's role in enabling electric vehicles (EVs) has been highlighted to replace the current oil‐driven vehicles in order to reduce the usage of oil resources and generation of CO2 gases. Unlike Li, sodium is one of the more abundant elements on Earth and exhibits similar chemical properties to Li, indicating that Na chemistry could be applied to a similar battery system. In the 1970s‐80s, both Na‐ion and Li‐ion electrodes were investigated, but the higher energy density of Li‐ion cells made them more applicable to small, portable electronic devices, and research efforts for rechargeable batteries have been mainly concentrated on LIB since then. Recently, research interest in Na‐ion batteries (NIB) has been resurrected, driven by new applications with requirements different from those in portable electronics, and to address the concern on Li abundance. In this article, both negative and positive electrode materials in NIB are briefly reviewed. While the voltage is generally lower and the volume change upon Na removal or insertion is larger for Na‐intercalation electrodes, compared to their Li equivalents, the power capability can vary depending on the crystal structures. It is concluded that cost‐effective NIB can partially replace LIB, but requires further investigation and improvement."
99,10.1021/jacs.7b11434,2018.0,Surface Chemistry in Cobalt Phosphide-Stabilized Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.,"Chemistry at the cathode/electrolyte interface plays an important role for lithium-sulfur batteries in which stable cycling of the sulfur cathode requires confinement of the lithium polysulfide intermediates and their fast electrochemical conversion on the electrode surface. While many materials have been found to be effective for confining polysulfides, the underlying chemical interactions remain poorly understood. We report a new and general lithium polysulfide-binding mechanism enabled by surface oxidation layers of transition-metal phosphide and chalcogenide materials. We for the first time find that CoP nanoparticles strongly adsorb polysulfides because their natural oxidation (forming Co-O-P-like species) activates the surface Co sites for binding polysulfides via strong Co-S bonding. With a surface oxidation layer capable of confining polysulfides and an inner core suitable for conducting electrons, the CoP nanoparticles are thus a desirable candidate for stabilizing and improving the performance of sulfur cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries. We demonstrate that sulfur electrodes that hold a high mass loading of 7 mg cm-2 and a high areal capacity of 5.6 mAh cm-2 can be stably cycled for 200 cycles. We further reveal that this new surface oxidation-induced polysulfide-binding scheme applies to a series of transition-metal phosphide and chalcogenide materials and can explain their stabilizing effects for lithium-sulfur batteries."
100,10.1002/adma.201700007,2017.0,Reviving Lithium‐Metal Anodes for Next‐Generation High‐Energy Batteries,"Lithium‐metal batteries (LMBs), as one of the most promising next‐generation high‐energy‐density storage devices, are able to meet the rigid demands of new industries. However, the direct utilization of metallic lithium can induce harsh safety issues, inferior rate and cycle performance, or anode pulverization inside the cells. These drawbacks severely hinder the commercialization of LMBs. Here, an up‐to‐date review of the behavior of lithium ions upon deposition/dissolution, and the failure mechanisms of lithium‐metal anodes is presented. It has been shown that the primary causes consist of the growth of lithium dendrites due to large polarization and a strong electric field at the vicinity of the anode, the hyperactivity of metallic lithium, and hostless infinite volume changes upon cycling. The recent advances in liquid organic electrolyte (LOE) systems through modulating the local current density, anion depletion, lithium flux, the anode–electrolyte interface, or the mechanical strength of the interlayers are highlighted. Concrete strategies including tailoring the anode structures, optimizing the electrolytes, building artificial anode–electrolyte interfaces, and functionalizing the protective interlayers are summarized in detail. Furthermore, the challenges remaining in LOE systems are outlined, and the future perspectives of introducing solid‐state electrolytes to radically address safety issues are presented."

However, their re‐stacking or aggregation during the electrode fabrication process has greatly hindered their further developments and applications in rechargeable lithium batteries. Recently, rationally designed hierarchical structures based on 2D nanomaterials have emerged as promising candidates in rechargeable lithium battery applications. Numerous synthetic strategies have been developed to obtain hierarchical structures and high‐performance energy storage devices based on these hierarchical structure have been realized. This review summarizes the synthesis and characteristics of three styles of hierarchical architecture, namely three‐dimensional (3D) porous network nanostructures, hollow nanostructures and self‐supported nanoarrays, presents the representative applications of hierarchical structured nanomaterials as functional materials for lithium ion batteries, lithium‐sulfur batteries and lithium‐oxygen batteries, meanwhile sheds light particularly on the relationship between structure engineering and improved electrochemical performance; and provides the existing challenges and the perspectives for this fast emerging field."
102,10.1126/science.1246432,2014.0,Unlocking the Potential of Cation-Disordered Oxides for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries,"Disorderly Flow Lithium batteries are becoming ever more important in society. While their application used to be confined to portable electronics, they are now becoming the enabling technology for electric vehicles and grid storage for renewables. Generally, the flow of lithium ions into and out of battery electrodes is thought to require ordered materials. Lee et al. (p. 519, published online 9 January) used a combination of experimental work and computations to identify disordered electrode materials with high Li diffusion. The improved energy density properties could be attributed to compositions with excess lithium beyond the stoichiometric limit, leading to intermixing between the lithium and transition metal sublattices and the formation of a percolation network providing specific lithium transport pathways. Cation-disordered compounds achieve high lithium (Li) storage capacity, with scope for high–energy density Li battery electrodes. Nearly all high–energy density cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries are well-ordered materials in which lithium and other cations occupy distinct sites. Cation-disordered materials are generally disregarded as cathodes because lithium diffusion tends to be limited by their structures. The performance of Li1.211Mo0.467Cr0.3O2 shows that lithium diffusion can be facile in disordered materials. Using ab initio computations, we demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is due to percolation of a certain type of active diffusion channels in disordered Li-excess materials. A unified understanding of high performance in both layered and Li-excess materials may enable the design of disordered-electrode materials with high capacity and high energy density."

Since the energy density of the batteries relies heavily on the cathode material used, major research efforts have been made to develop alternative cathode materials with a higher degree of lithium utilization and specific energy density. In particular, layered, Ni-rich, lithium transition-metal oxides can deliver higher capacity at lower cost than the conventional LiCoO2 . However, for these Ni-rich compounds there are still several problems associated with their cycle life, thermal stability, and safety. Herein the performance enhancement of Ni-rich cathode materials through structure tuning or interface engineering is summarized. The underlying mechanisms and remaining challenges will also be discussed."
104,10.1039/c6cs00875e,2017.0,High-voltage positive electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.,"The ever-growing demand for advanced rechargeable lithium-ion batteries in portable electronics and electric vehicles has spurred intensive research efforts over the past decade. The key to sustaining the progress in Li-ion batteries lies in the quest for safe, low-cost positive electrode (cathode) materials with desirable energy and power capabilities. One approach to boost the energy and power densities of batteries is to increase the output voltage while maintaining a high capacity, fast charge-discharge rate, and long service life. This review gives an account of the various emerging high-voltage positive electrode materials that have the potential to satisfy these requirements either in the short or long term, including nickel-rich layered oxides, lithium-rich layered oxides, high-voltage spinel oxides, and high-voltage polyanionic compounds. The key barriers and the corresponding strategies for the practical viability of these cathode materials are discussed along with the optimization of electrolytes and other cell components, with a particular emphasis on recent advances in the literature.

Efficient conversion of lithium polysulfides to lithium sulfide (during discharge) and to sulfur (during recharge) is a performance-determining factor for lithium–sulfur batteries. Here we show that MoS2−x/reduced graphene oxide (MoS2−x/rGO) can be used to catalyze the polysulfide reactions to improve the battery performance. It was confirmed, through microstructural characterization of the materials, that sulfur deficiencies on the surface participated in the polysulfide reactions and significantly enhanced the polysulfide conversion kinetics. The fast conversion of soluble polysulfides decreased their accumulation in the sulfur cathode and their loss from the cathode by diffusion. Hence in the presence of a small amount of MoS2−x/rGO (4 wt% of the cathode mass), high rate (8C) performance of the sulfur cathode was improved from a capacity of 161.1 mA h g−1 to 826.5 mA h g−1. In addition, MoS2−x/rGO also enhanced the cycle stability of the sulfur cathode from a capacity fade rate of 0.373% per cycle (over 150 cycles) to 0.083% per cycle (over 600 cycles) at a typical 0.5C rate. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the catalytic role of MoS2−x/rGO in promoting the polysulfide conversion kinetics in the sulfur cathode."

The strong anchoring of intermediates is widely accepted to retard the shuttle of polysulfides in a working battery. However, the understanding of the intrinsic chemistry is still deficient. Inspired by the concept of hydrogen bond, herein we focus on the Li bond chemistry in Li-S batteries through sophisticated quantum chemical calculations, in combination with 7 Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Identified as Li bond, the strong dipole-dipole interaction between Li polysulfides and Li-S cathode materials originates from the electron-rich donors (e.g., pyridinic nitrogen (pN)), and is enhanced by the inductive and conjugative effect of scaffold materials with π-electrons (e.g., graphene). The chemical shift of Li polysulfides in 7 Li NMR spectroscopy, being both theoretically predicted and experimentally verified, is suggested to serve as a quantitative descriptor of Li bond strength. These theoretical insights were further proved by actual electrochemical tests. This work highlights the importance of Li bond chemistry in Li-S cell and provides a deep comprehension, which is helpful to the cathode materials rational design and practical applications of Li-S batteries."

Lithium-ion batteries, the current main power sources, are gradually approaching their theoretical limitation in terms of energy density. Therefore, alternative battery chemistries are urgently required for next-generation flexible power sources with high energy densities, low cost, and inherent safety. Flexible lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and analogous flexible alkali metal-chalcogen batteries are of paramount interest owing to their high energy densities endowed by multielectron chemistry. In this review, we summarized the recent progress of flexible Li-S and analogous batteries. A brief introduction to flexible energy storage systems and general Li-S batteries has been provided first. Progress in flexible materials for flexible Li-S batteries are reviewed subsequently, with a detailed classification of flexible sulfur cathodes as those based on carbonaceous (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, and carbonized polymers) and composite (polymers and inorganics) materials and an overview of flexible lithium anodes and flexible solid-state electrolytes. Advancements in other flexible alkali metal-chalcogen batteries are then introduced.

With these requirements, lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries promise great potential to be the next‐generation high‐energy system. However, the practicality of Li–S technology is hindered by technical obstacles, such as short shelf and cycle life and low sulfur content/loading, arising from the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates between the cathode and anode and the poor electronic conductivity of S and the discharge product Li2S. Much progress has been made during the past five years to circumvent these problems by employing sulfur–carbon or sulfur–polymer composite cathodes, novel cell configurations, and lithium‐metal anode stabilization. This Progress Report highlights recent developments with special attention toward innovation in sulfur‐encapsulation techniques, development of novel materials, and cell‐component design. The scientific understanding and engineering concerns are discussed at the end in every developmental stage.

However, the shuttle effect greatly reduces the battery cycle life and sulfur utilization, which is great deterrent to its practical use. This paper reviews the tremendous efforts that are made to find a remedy for this problem, mostly through physical or chemical confinement of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Intrinsically, this “confinement” has a relatively limited effect on improving the battery performance because in most cases, the LiPSs are “passively” blocked and cannot be reused. Thus, this strategy becomes less effective with a high sulfur loading and ultralong cycling. A more “positive” method that not only traps but also increases the subsequent conversion of LiPSs back to lithium sulfides is urgently needed to fundamentally solve the shuttle effect. Here, recent advances on catalytic effects in increasing the rate of conversion of soluble long‐chain LiPSs to insoluble short‐chain Li2S2/Li2S, and vice versa, are reviewed, and the roles of noble metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, and some metal‐free materials in this process are highlighted. Challenges and potential solutions for the design of catalytic cathodes and interlayers in Li–S battery are discussed in detail."

In spite of all these merits, the practical utilization of lithium–sulfur batteries is impeded by commonly known challenges, such as low sulfur utilization (<80%), short life (<200 cycles), fast capacity fade, and severe self‐discharge effect, which mainly result from the i) low conductivity of the active material, ii) serious polysulfide shuttling, iii) large volume changes, and iv) lithium–metal anode contamination/corrosion. Numerous approaches are reported to effectively mitigate these issues. Indeed, such approaches have shown enhanced lithium–sulfur battery performances. However, many reports overlook the critical parameters, including sulfur loading (<13 mg cm−2), sulfur content (<70 wt%), and electrolyte/sulfur ratio (>11 µL mg−1), that significantly affect the analyzed electrochemical characteristics, energy density, and practicality of lithium–sulfur batteries. This review highlights the trends and progress in making cells fulfilling these fabrication parameters and discuss the challenges of the amount of sulfur and electrolyte in fabricating cells with practically necessary parameters and with high electrochemical utilization and efficiency."

To compete with state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, solid electrolytes with higher ionic conductivities are needed, especially if thick electrode configurations are to be used. In the search for optimized ionic conductors, the lithium argyrodites have attracted a lot of interest. Here, we systematically explore the influence of aliovalent substitution in Li6+ xP1- xGe xS5I using a combination of X-ray and neutron diffraction, as well as impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. With increasing Ge content, an anion site disorder is induced and the activation barrier for ionic motion drops significantly, leading to the fastest lithium argyrodite so far with 5.4 ± 0.8 mS cm-1 in a cold-pressed state and 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm-1 upon sintering. These high ionic conductivities allow for successful implementation within a thick-electrode solid-state battery that shows negligible capacity fade over 150 cycles.

Recently, the importance of the strong chemical interaction between polar materials and polysulfides is recognized by researchers to improve the performance of Li–S batteries, especially with respect to the shuttle effect. Polar materials, unlike nonpolar materials, exhibit strong interactions with polysulfides without any modification or doping because of their intrinsic polarity, absorbing the polar polysulfides and thus suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. The recent advances on polar materials for Li–S batteries are reviewed here, especially the chemical polar–polar interaction effects toward immobilizing dissolved polysulfides, and the relationship between the intrinsic properties of the polar materials and the electrochemical performance of the Li–S batteries are discussed.

Among different types of spent LIBs, processing and recycling the spent LiFePO4 batteries are challenging because of their relatively low extraction efficiency and recycling selectivity of valuable metal(s) and great potential for secondary waste generation. In this research, an effective and sustainable approach for selective leaching of lithium from spent LiFePO4 batteries was demonstrated. By properly adjusting or controlling the oxidative state and proton activity of the leaching solution, lithium was found to be selectively leached with a high recovery efficiency. The aluminium remained in the metallic form and iron as FePO4 in the solid residue which can be easily separated by sieving. The effects of a range of parameters (i.e. acid concentration, initial volume fraction of the oxidant, liquid-to-solid ratio, reaction temperature and time) during lithium leaching were comprehensively investigated. The selective reaction mechanisms were clarified and the controlling step for the leaching kinetics was identified. Based on the laboratory scale results, a pilot batch process was developed and simulated. The process is found to be techno-economically feasible and environmentally friendly for recycling of spent LiFePO4 batteries using selective leaching. High purity Li2CO3 (99.95 wt%) could be obtained with a high recovery rate. This research demonstrates the possibility of improving the metal recycling effectiveness from spent LiFePO4 batteries by incorporating the principles of green chemistry and probably contributes to the sustainability of the lithium ion battery industry."

A further increase in the energy storage characteristics of such cells is challenging because capacities of such intercalation compounds approach their theoretical values and a further increase in their maximum voltage induces serious safety concerns. The growing market for portable energy storage is undergoing a rapid expansion as new applications demand lighter, smaller, safer and lower cost batteries to enable broader use of plug-in hybrid and pure-electric vehicles (PHEVs and EVs), drones and renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind. Conversion-type cathode materials are some of the key candidates for the next-generation of rechargeable Li and Li-ion batteries. Continuous rapid progress in performance improvements of such cathodes is essential to utilize them in future applications. In this review we consider price, abundance and safety of the elements in the periodic table for their use in conversion cathodes. We further compare specific and volumetric capacities of a broad range of conversion materials. By offering a model for practically achievable volumetric energy density and specific energy of Li cells with graphite, silicon (Si) and lithium (Li) anodes, we observe the impact of cathode chemistry directly. This allows us to estimate potentials of different conversion cathodes for exceeding the energy characteristics of cells built with state of the art intercalation compounds. We additionally review the key challenges faced when using conversion-type active materials in cells and general strategies to overcome them.

However, the practical application of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries is seriously impeded by the notorious shuttling of soluble polysulfide intermediates, inducing a low utilization of active materials, severe self‐discharge, and thus a poor cycling life, which is particularly severe in high‐sulfur‐loading cathodes. Herein, a polysulfide‐immobilizing polymer is reported to address the shuttling issues. A natural polymer of Gum Arabic (GA) with precise oxygen‐containing functional groups that can induce a strong binding interaction toward lithium polysulfides is deposited onto a conductive support of a carbon nanofiber (CNF) film as a polysulfide shielding interlayer.

In particular, the coupling of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with the cell chemistry of Li-S batteries enables a safe and high-capacity electrochemical energy storage system, due to the better processability and less flammability of SPEs compared to liquid electrolytes. However, the practical deployment of all solid-state Li-S batteries (ASSLSBs) containing SPEs is largely hindered by the low accessibility of active materials and side reactions of soluble polysulfide species, resulting in a poor specific capacity and cyclability. In the present work, an ultrahigh performance of ASSLSBs is obtained via an anomalous synergistic effect between (fluorosulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions inherited from the design of lithium salts in SPEs and the polysulfide species formed during the cycling. The corresponding Li-S cells deliver high specific/areal capacity (1394 mAh gsulfur-1, 1.2 mAh cm-2), good Coulombic efficiency, and superior rate capability (∼800 mAh gsulfur-1 after 60 cycles).

However, the practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries are challenged by several obstacles, including the low sulfur utilization and poor lifespan, which are partly attributed to the shuttle of lithium polysulﬁdes and lithium dendrite growth in working lithium–sulfur batteries. Suppressing lithium dendrite growth is a necessary step not only for a safe and efﬁcient Li metal anode, but also for a high capacity cell with a high Coulombic efﬁciency. Herein we review the lithium metal anode protection in a polysulﬁde-rich environment, relative to most reviews on lithium metal anode without considering the effect of lithium polysulﬁdes in lithium metal batteries. Firstly, the importance and dilemma of Li metal anode issues in lithium–sulfur batteries are underscored, aiming to arouse the attentions to Li metal anode protection.

However, Li–S batteries are subjected to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling due to their high dissolution in liquid electrolyte, resulting in low columbic efficiency and poor cycling performance. Moreover, the Li metal as an indispensable anode of Li–S batteries shows serious safety issues derived from the lithium dendrite formation. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid‐state electrolytes (SSEs) has been recognized as a fundamental approach to effectively address above problems. In this review, the progress on applying various classes of SSEs including gel, solid‐state polymer, ceramic, and composite electrolytes to solve the issues of Li–S batteries is summarized. The specific capacity of Li–S batteries is effectively improved due to the suppression of LiPSs shuttling by SSEs, while the rate and cycling performance remain relatively poor owing to the limited ionic conductivity and high interfacial resistance. Designing smart electrode/electrolyte integrated architectures, enabling the high ionic transportation pathway and compatible electrode/electrolyte interface, may be an effective way to achieve high performance solid‐state Li–S batteries."

The utilization of green energy, including solar and wind power, is believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to support more sustainable economic growth. In this regard, lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) can play a critically important role. To further increase the energy and power densities of LIBs, silicon anodes have been intensively explored due to their high capacity, low operation potential, environmental friendliness, and high abundance.

Although its crystal structure is classified as a cation-disordered rocksalt-type structure, lithium ions quickly migrate in percolative network in bulk without a sacrifice in kinetics. Moreover, the large reversible capacity originates from the participation of oxide ions for a charge compensation process, which has been confirmed by first-principles calculations combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This finding can be further expanded to the design of innovative positive electrode materials beyond the restriction of the solid-state redox reaction based on the transition metals used for the past three decades. Rechargeable lithium batteries have rapidly risen to prominence as fundamental devices for green and sustainable energy development. Lithium batteries are now used as power sources for electric vehicles. However, materials innovations are still needed to satisfy the growing demand for increasing energy density of lithium batteries. In the past decade, lithium-excess compounds, Li2MeO3 (Me = Mn4+, Ru4+, etc.), have been extensively studied as high-capacity positive electrode materials. Although the origin as the high reversible capacity has been a debatable subject for a long time, recently it has been confirmed that charge compensation is partly achieved by solid-state redox of nonmetal anions (i.e., oxide ions), coupled with solid-state redox of transition metals, which is the basic theory used for classic lithium insertion materials, such as LiMeO2 (Me = Co3+, Ni3+, etc.). Herein, as a compound with further excess lithium contents, a cation-ordered rocksalt phase with lithium and pentavalent niobium ions, Li3NbO4, is first examined as the host structure of a new series of high-capacity positive electrode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries. Approximately 300 mAh⋅g−1 of high-reversible capacity at 50 °C is experimentally observed, which partly originates from charge compensation by solid-state redox of oxide ions. It is proposed that such a charge compensation process by oxide ions is effectively stabilized by the presence of electrochemically inactive niobium ions. These results will contribute to the development of a new class of high-capacity electrode materials, potentially with further lithium enrichment (and fewer transition metals) in the close-packed framework structure with oxide ions."

Uneven electrodeposition is a serious problem in almost all rechargeable batteries that use high-energy metals such as aluminum, lithium, sodium, or zinc as the anode because it leads to formation of dendritic structures that expose the device to a variety of failure modes, including catastrophic failure by internal short circuiting. We investigate the effect of lithium fluoride salt additives on electrodeposition of metals in batteries that use metallic lithium anodes. Through systematic electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopy studies, we find that these additives provide a robust strategy for improving both the lifetime and coulombic efficiency of a battery at both high and low current densities. We show that LiF simultaneously acts to protect lithium metal anode surface and also improves interfacial Li-ion transport, thus enabling faster and flatter electrodeposition with longer cycle life. Finally, we demonstrate that a conventional electrolyte reinforced with as little as 0.5 w% LiF salt can be used to enable Li/LiFePO4 full cells that exhibit stable cycling for over 150 cycles of charge and discharge at high current density."

157,10.1021/ar300179v,2013.0,Challenges and prospects of lithium-sulfur batteries.,"Electrical energy storage is one of the most critical needs of 21st century society. Applications that depend on electrical energy storage include portable electronics, electric vehicles, and devices for renewable energy storage from solar and wind. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have the highest energy density among the rechargeable battery chemistries. As a result, Li-ion batteries have proven successful in the portable electronics market and will play a significant role in large-scale energy storage. Over the past two decades, Li-ion batteries based on insertion cathodes have reached a cathode capacity of ∼250 mA h g(-1) and an energy density of ∼800 W h kg(-1), which do not meet the requirement of ∼500 km between charges for all-electric vehicles. With a goal of increasing energy density, researchers are pursuing alternative cathode materials such as sulfur and O2 that can offer capacities that exceed those of conventional insertion cathodes, such as LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4, by an order of magnitude (>1500 mA h g(-1)). Sulfur, one of the most abundant elements on earth, is an electrochemically active material that can accept up to two electrons per atom at ∼2.1 V vs Li/Li(+). As a result, sulfur cathode materials have a high theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g(-1), and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have a theoretical energy density of ∼2600 W h kg(-1). Unlike conventional insertion cathode materials, sulfur undergoes a series of compositional and structural changes during cycling, which involve soluble polysulfides and insoluble sulfides. As a result, researchers have struggled with the maintenance of a stable electrode structure, full utilization of the active material, and sufficient cycle life with good system efficiency. Although researchers have made significant progress on rechargeable Li-S batteries in the last decade, these cycle life and efficiency problems prevent their use in commercial cells. To overcome these persistent problems, researchers will need new sulfur composite cathodes with favorable properties and performance and new Li-S cell configurations. In this Account, we first focus on the development of novel composite cathode materials including sulfur-carbon and sulfur-polymer composites, describing the design principles, structure and properties, and electrochemical performances of these new materials. We then cover new cell configurations with carbon interlayers and Li/dissolved polysulfide cells, emphasizing the potential of these approaches to advance capacity retention and system efficiency. Finally, we provide a brief survey of efficient electrolytes. The Account summarizes improvements that could bring Li-S technology closer to mass commercialization."

From a review of a range of analytical studies and physical models, it is clear that experimental understanding is well ahead of state-of-the-art models. Yet this understanding is still hindered by the limitations of available techniques and the implications of experiment and cell design on the mechanism. The mechanisms at the core of physical models for Li–S cells are overly simplistic compared to the latest thinking based upon experimental results, but creating more complicated models will be difficult, due to the lack of and inability to easily measure the necessary parameters.

However, the practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries suffer from poor cycle life and low Coulombic efficiency, which is attributed, in part, to the polysulfide shuttle and Li dendrite formation. Suppressing Li dendrite growth, blocking the unfavorable reaction between soluble polysulfides and Li, and improving the safety of Li–S batteries have become very important for the development of high‐performance lithium sulfur batteries.

They also constitute a major incentive to harness alternative sources of energy and means of vehicle propulsion. Today's lithium-ion batteries, although suitable for small-scale devices, do not yet have sufficient energy or life for use in vehicles that would match the performance of internal combustion vehicles.

Major advances have been made in lithium-battery technology over the past two decades by the discovery of new materials and designs through intuitive approaches, experimental and predictive reasoning, and meticulous control of surface structures and chemical reactions. Further improvements in energy density of factors of two to three may yet be achievable for current day lithium-ion systems; factors of five or more may be possible for lithium–oxygen systems, ultimately leading to our ability to confine extremely high potential energy in a small volume without compromising safety, but only if daunting technological barriers can be overcome."

Introducing anchoring materials, which can induce strong binding interaction with Li2Sn species, has been demonstrated as an effective way to overcome this problem and achieve long-term cycling stability and high-rate performance. The interaction between Li2Sn species and anchoring materials should be studied at the atomic level in order to understand the mechanism behind the anchoring effect and to identify ideal anchoring materials to further improve the performance of Li-S batteries. Using first-principles approach with van der Waals interaction included, we systematically investigate the adsorption of Li2Sn species on various two-dimensional layered materials (oxides, sulfides, and chlorides) and study the detailed interaction and electronic structure, including binding strength, configuration distortion, and charge transfer. We gain insight into how van der Waals interaction and chemical binding contribute to the adsorption of Li2Sn species for anchoring materials with strong, medium, and weak interactions. We understand why the anchoring materials can avoid the detachment of Li2S as in carbon substrate, and we discover that too strong binding strength can cause decomposition of Li2Sn species."

However, the shuttle of polysulfide induces rapid capacity degradation and poor cycling stability of lithium-sulfur cells. Herein, we proposed a unique lithium-sulfur battery configuration with an ultrathin graphene oxide (GO) membrane for high stability. The oxygen electronegative atoms modified GO into a polar plane, and the carboxyl groups acted as ion-hopping sites of positively charged species (Li(+)) and rejected the transportation of negatively charged species (Sn(2-)) due to the electrostatic interactions. Such electrostatic repulsion and physical inhibition largely decreased the transference of polysulfides across the GO membrane in the lithium-sulfur system. Consequently, the GO membrane with highly tunable functionalization properties, high mechanical strength, low electric conductivity, and facile fabrication procedure is an effective permselective separator system in lithium-sulfur batteries. By the incorporation of a permselective GO membrane, the cyclic capacity decay rate is also reduced from 0.49 to 0.23%/cycle. As the GO membrane blocks the diffusion of polysulfides through the membrane, it is also with advantages of anti-self-discharge properties."

Despite similar problems of Li–Se and lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, such as the so-called shuttle effect, the research strategies go in different directions because of new opportunities offered by the Li–Se batteries. For instance, Li–Se batteries can perform better in the conventional carbonate-based electrolytes, in which polysulfides are chemically unstable. The present manuscript comprehensively reviews the current status of the Li–Se battery based on the achievements during its short history. Furthermore, a promising possibility is the lithium–(sulfur/selenium) battery, utilizing a sulfur/selenium cathode that can gain the advantages of both batteries.

The attention is then focused on the electrode materials presently considered the most promising for enhancing the energy density of the batteries. At the anode side a discussion is provided on the status of development of high capacity tin and silicon lithium alloys.

Reduced graphite oxide inherits the layer structure of graphite, with an average spacing between neighboring layers (d-spacing) of 0.374 nm; this exceeds the d-spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). The larger d-spacing provides wider channels for transporting lithium ions and sodium ions in the material. We showed that reduced graphite oxide as an anode in lithium-ion batteries can reach a specific capacity of 917 mA h g-1, which is about three times of 372 mA h g-1, the value expected for the LiC6 structures on the electrode. This increase is consistent with the wider d-spacing, which enhances lithium intercalation and de-intercalation on the electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries with reduced graphite oxide anodes show a noticeable improvement compared to those with reduced graphene oxide anodes. This improvement indicates that reduced graphite oxide, with larger interlayer spacing, has fewer defects and is thus more stable. In summary, we found that reduced graphite oxide may be a more favorable form of graphene for the fabrication of electrodes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries and other energy storage devices."

Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C60 to the GNS."

Despite high ionic conductivities, current inorganic solid electrolytes cannot be used in lithium batteries because of a lack of compliance and adhesion to active particles in battery electrodes as they are discharged and charged. We have successfully developed a compliant, nonflammable, hybrid single ion-conducting electrolyte comprising inorganic sulfide glass particles covalently bonded to a perfluoropolyether polymer. The hybrid with 23 wt% perfluoropolyether exhibits low shear modulus relative to neat glass electrolytes, ionic conductivity of 10−4 S/cm at room temperature, a cation transference number close to unity, and an electrochemical stability window up to 5 V relative to Li+/Li. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates that the hybrid electrolyte limits lithium polysulfide dissolution and is, thus, ideally suited for Li-S cells. Our work opens a previously unidentified route for developing compliant solid electrolytes that will address the challenges of lithium batteries."
180,10.1039/C4EE01432D,2014.0,A review of recent developments in membrane separators for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries,"In this paper, the recent developments and the characteristics of membrane separators for lithium-ion batteries are reviewed. In recent years, there have been intensive efforts to develop advanced battery separators for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for different applications such as portable electronics, electric vehicles, and energy storage for power grids. The separator is a critical component of lithium-ion batteries since it provides a physical barrier between the positive and negative electrodes in order to prevent electrical short circuits. The separator also serves as the electrolyte reservoir for the transport of ions during the charging and discharging cycles of a battery. The performance of lithium-ion batteries is greatly affected by the materials and structure of the separators. This paper introduces the requirements of battery separators and the structure and properties of five important types of membrane separators which are microporous membranes, modified microporous membranes, non-woven mats, composite membranes and electrolyte membranes. Each separator type has inherent advantages and disadvantages which influence the performance of lithium-ion batteries. The structures, characteristics, manufacturing, modification, and performance of separators are described in this review paper. The outlook and future directions in this research field are also given."
181,10.1002/aenm.201500117,2015.0,Recent Advances in Electrolytes for Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"The rapidly increasing demand for electrical and hybrid vehicles and stationary energy storage requires the development of “beyond Li‐ion batteries” with high energy densities that exceed those of state‐of‐the‐art Li‐ion batteries. Li–S batteries, which have very high theoretical capacities and energy densities, are believed to be one of the most promising candidates. The sulfur‐based electrochemical reaction requires novel electrolytes to replace the classical carbonate‐based electrolyte systems inherited from Li‐ion batteries because carbonates are incompatible with the intermediate polysulfides in Li–S batteries. In addition, the theoretical specific capacities and projected energy densities of Li–S batteries are difficult to achieve experimentally, mainly because of the electronically insulating nature of sulfur and lithium sulfide cathodes, and the shuttle effect; this is a serious issue associated with the dissolution and diffusion of soluble polysulfides in most potential electrolytes and causes rapid capacity fading. It is therefore highly desirable to explore, modify, and/or optimize electrolytes for Li–S batteries to address these issues and improve their capacities, cycling stabilities, rate performances, and energy densities. An overview of recent developments in electrolytes for Li–S batteries is provided with a focus on the chemistry of polysulfides in different electrolyte media, including polysulfide solubility and its relevance to battery performance."

184,10.1021/ja412807w,2014.0,Unusual stability of acetonitrile-based superconcentrated electrolytes for fast-charging lithium-ion batteries.,"The development of a stable, functional electrolyte is urgently required for fast-charging and high-voltage lithium-ion batteries as well as next-generation advanced batteries (e.g., Li-O2 systems). Acetonitrile (AN) solutions are one of the most promising electrolytes with remarkably high chemical and oxidative stability as well as high ionic conductivity, but its low stability against reduction is a critical problem that hinders its extensive applications. Herein, we report enhanced reductive stability of a superconcentrated AN solution (>4 mol dm(-3)). Applying it to a battery electrolyte, we demonstrate, for the first time, reversible lithium intercalation into a graphite electrode in a reduction-vulnerable AN solvent. Moreover, the reaction kinetics is much faster than in a currently used commercial electrolyte. First-principle calculations combined with spectroscopic analyses reveal that the peculiar reductive stability arises from modified frontier orbital characters unique to such superconcentrated solutions, in which all solvents and anions coordinate to Li(+) cations to form a fluid polymeric network of anions and Li(+) cations."

Nanostructured materials such as nano-carbons, alloys, metal oxides, and metal sulfides/nitrides have been used as anodes for next-generation LIBs with high reversible capacity, fast power capability, good safety, and long cycle life. This is due to their relatively short mass and charge pathways, high transport rates of both lithium ions and electrons, and other extremely charming surface activities.

Especially the low price and abundant availability of sulfur as the cathode material and the high theoretical capacity in comparison to state-of-the art lithium-ion technologies are attractive features. Despite significant research achievements that have been made over the last years, fundamental (electro-) chemical questions still remain unanswered. This review addresses ten crucial questions associated with lithium-sulfur batteries and critically evaluates current research with respect to them. The sulfur-carbon composite cathode is a particular focus, but its complex interplay with other hardware components in the cell, such as the electrolyte and the anode, necessitates a critical discussion of other cell components. Modern in situ characterisation methods are ideally suited to illuminate the role of each component. This article does not pretend to summarise all recently published data, but instead is a critical overview over lithium-sulfur batteries based on recent research findings."

However, rapid capacity fade and low sulfur utilisation inhibit their use. We designed a unique sandwich structure with pure sulfur between two graphene membranes, which are continuously produced over a large area, as a very simple but effective approach for the fabrication of Li–S batteries with ultrafast charge/discharge rates and long-life. One membrane was used as a graphene current collector (GCC) to replace the conventional aluminium foil current collector, and sulfur was coated onto this membrane as the active material. The other membrane was coated onto a conventional polymer separator (G-separator). This electrode showed a high specific capacity of 1340 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1, a Coulombic efficiency approaching 100%, excellent high-rate performance and long cyclic stability. The GCC and G-separator not only effectively reduce the internal resistance of the sulfur cathode but also function as buffer layers to trap/immobilise and reuse the dissolved lithium polysulfides. Furthermore, for the first time, three-dimensional X-ray microtomography was used to investigate sulfur diffusion during electrochemical charge/discharge."

In this paper, a mesoporous nitrogen‐doped carbon (MPNC)‐sulfur nanocomposite is reported as a novel cathode for advanced Li‐S batteries. The nitrogen doping in the MPNC material can effectively promote chemical adsorption between sulfur atoms and oxygen functional groups on the carbon, as verified by X‐ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, and the mechanism by which nitrogen enables the behavior is further revealed by density functional theory calculations. Based on the advantages of the porous structure and nitrogen doping, the MPNC‐sulfur cathodes show excellent cycling stability (95% retention within 100 cycles) at a high current density of 0.7 mAh cm‐2 with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg S cm‐2) and a sulfur content (70 wt%). A high areal capacity (≈3.3 mAh cm‐2) is demonstrated by using the novel cathode, which is crucial for the practical application of Li‐S batteries.

189,10.1002/aenm.201502164,2016.0,From Lithium‐Oxygen to Lithium‐Air Batteries: Challenges and Opportunities,"Lithium‐air batteries have become a focus of research on future battery technologies. Technical issues associated with lithium‐air batteries, however, are rather complex. Apart from the sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics which demand efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, issues are also inherited from the nature of an open battery system and the use of reactive metal lithium as anode. Lithium‐air batteries, which exchange oxygen directly with ambient air, face more challenges due to the additional oxidative agents of moisture, carbon dioxide, etc. which degrade the metal lithium anode, deteriorating the performance of the batteries. In order to improve the cycling performance one must hold a full picture of lithium‐oxygen electrochemistry in the presence of carbon dioxide and/or moisture and fully understand the fundamentals of chemistry reactions therein. Recent advances in the exploration of the effect of moisture and CO2 contaminants on Li‐O2 batteries are reviewed, and the mechanistic understanding of discharge/charge process in O2 at controlled level of moisture and/or CO2 are illustrated.

As the demands of high-performance batteries are continuously increasing, with large-scale energy storage systems and electric mobility equipment, lithium-sulfur batteries have become an attractive candidate for the new generation of high-performance batteries due to their high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g-1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg-1). However, rapid capacity attenuation with poor cycle and rate performances make the batteries far from ideal with respect to real commercial applications. Outstanding breakthroughs and achievements have been made to alleviate these problems in the past ten years. This paper presents an overview of recent advances in lithium-sulfur battery research. We cover the research and development to date on various components of lithium-sulfur batteries, including cathodes, binders, separators, electrolytes, anodes, collectors, and some novel cell configurations.

191,10.1039/C6EE00789A,2016.0,The critical role of lithium nitrate in the gas evolution of lithium–sulfur batteries,"Sulfur–carbon composites are promising next generation cathode materials for high energy density lithium batteries and thus, their discharge and charge properties have been studied with increasing intensity in recent years. While the sulfur-based redox reactions are reasonably well understood, the knowledge of deleterious side reactions in lithium–sulfur batteries is still limited. In particular, the gassing behavior has not yet been investigated, although it is known that lithium metal readily reacts with the commonly used ethereal electrolytes. Herein, we describe, for the first time, gas evolution in operating lithium–sulfur cells with a diglyme-based electrolyte and evaluate the effect of the polysulfide shuttle-suppressing additive LiNO3. The use of the combination of two operando techniques (pressure measurements and online continuous flow differential electrochemical mass spectrometry coupled with infrared spectroscopy) demonstrates that the additive dramatically reduces, but does not completely eliminate gassing. The major increase in pressure occurs during charge, immediately after fresh lithium is deposited, but there are differences in gas generation during cycling depending on the addition of LiNO3. Cells with LiNO3 show evolution of N2 and N2O in addition to CH4 and H2, the latter being the main volatile decomposition products. Collectively, these results provide novel insight into the important function of LiNO3 as a stabilizing additive in lithium–sulfur batteries."

The inorganic components in SEI, including lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium fluoride (LiF), provide both mechanical and chemical protection, meanwhile control lithium ion transport. Although both Li2CO3 and LiF have relatively low ionic conductivity, we found, surprisingly, that the contact between Li2CO3 and LiF can promote space charge accumulation along their interfaces, which generates a higher ionic carrier concentration and significantly improves lithium ion transport and reduces electron leakage. The synergetic effect of the two inorganic components leads to high current efficiency and long cycle stability."

However, safety and life issues are still great challenges for the practical applications of LIBs. Metallic lithium plating on the negative electrode under critical charging conditions accelerates performance degradation and poses safety hazards for LIBs. Therefore, anode lithium plating in LIBs has recently drawn increased attention. This article reviews the recent research and progress regarding anode lithium plating of LIBs. Firstly, the adverse effects of anode lithium plating on the electrochemical performance of LIBs are presented. Various in situ and ex situ techniques for characterizing and detecting anode lithium plating are then summarized.

The race to develop such cell systems is mainly motivated by the very high theoretical energy density and the abundance of sulfur and oxygen. The cell chemistry, however, is complex, and progress toward practical device development remains hampered by some fundamental key issues, which are currently being tackled by numerous approaches. Quite surprisingly, not much is known about the analogous sodium-based battery systems, although the already commercialized, high-temperature Na/S8 and Na/NiCl2 batteries suggest that a rechargeable battery based on sodium is feasible on a large scale. Moreover, the natural abundance of sodium is an attractive benefit for the development of batteries based on low cost components. This review provides a summary of the state-of-the-art knowledge on lithium–sulfur and lithium–oxygen batteries and a direct comparison with the analogous sodium systems. The general properties, major benefits and challenges, recent strategies for performance improvements and general guidelines for further development are summarized and critically discussed. In general, the substitution of lithium for sodium has a strong impact on the overall properties of the cell reaction and differences in ion transport, phase stability, electrode potential, energy density, etc. can be thus expected. Whether these differences will benefit a more reversible cell chemistry is still an open question, but some of the first reports on room temperature Na/S8 and Na/O2 cells already show some exciting differences as compared to the established Li/S8 and Li/O2 systems."

As the first step, all the factors affecting the cycle life of lithium-ion batteries are identified and their impacts on degradation process are investigated. Subsequently, a general model for battery loss of cycle life is devised incorporating all the pertinent factors associated with charging and discharging activities in V2G applications. Modeling the battery wear cost as a series of equal-payments over the cycle life, a mechanism for calculating the cost incurred by EV users due to participation in V2G programs is developed. Taking into account the developed battery degradation cost model, EVs charge scheduling problem is revisited and it is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. As the actual battery degradation cost and adopted charging strategy are mutually dependent, a novel iterative method is proposed to efficiently obtain the optimal solution to charge scheduling problem and calculate the associated wear price. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method in integrating the degradation cost of lithium-ion batteries into charge scheduling of V2G-capable EVs."

Additionally, the use of sulfur as active cathode material has the advantages of being inexpensive, environmentally benign, and naturally abundant. However, the insulating nature of sulfur, the fast capacity fading, and the short lifespan of Li–S batteries have been hampered their commercialization. In this paper, a functional mesoporous carbon‐coated separator is presented for improving the overall performance of Li–S batteries. A straightforward coating modification of the commercial polypropylene separator allows the integration of a conductive mesoporous carbon layer which offers a physical place to localize dissolved polysulfide intermediates and retain them as active material within the cathode side. Despite the use of a simple sulfur–carbon black mixture as cathode, the Li–S cell with a mesoporous carbon‐coated separator offers outstanding performance with an initial capacity of 1378 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C, and high reversible capacity of 723 mAh g−1, and degradation rate of only 0.081% per cycle, after 500 cycles at 0.5 C."

To ensure a high reliability of lithium-ion batteries, prognostic actions for lithium-ion batteries should be prepared. In this paper, a prognostic method is proposed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries. A state-space model for the lithium-ion battery capacity is first constructed to assess capacity degradation. Then, a spherical cubature particle filter (SCPF) is introduced to solve the state-space model. The major idea of the SCPF is to adapt a spherical cubature integration-based Kalman filter to provide an importance function of a standard particle filter (PF). Once the state-space model is determined, the extrapolations of the state-space model to a specified failure threshold are performed to infer the RUL of the lithium-ion batteries. Degradation data of 26 lithium-ion battery capacities were analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed prognostic method. The analytical results show that the proposed prognostic method is more effective in the prediction of RUL of lithium-ion batteries, compared with an existing PF-based prognostic method."

However, alloying anodes usually exhibit a short cycle life due to the extreme volumetric and structural changes that occur during lithium insertion/extraction; these transformations cause mechanical fracture and exacerbate side reactions. To solve these problems, there has recently been significant attention devoted to creating silicon nanostructures that can accommodate the lithiation‐induced strain and thus exhibit high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life. In parallel, many experiments and simulations have been conducted in an effort to understand the details of volumetric expansion, fracture, mechanical stress evolution, and structural changes in silicon nanostructures. The fundamental materials knowledge gained from these studies has provided guidance for designing optimized Si electrode structures and has also shed light on the factors that control large‐volume change solid‐state reactions. In this paper, we review various fundamental studies that have been conducted to understand structural and volumetric changes, stress evolution, mechanical properties, and fracture behavior of nanostructured Si anodes for lithium‐ion batteries and compare the reaction process of Si to other novel anode materials."

Such nanostructures provide a facile method for introducing sufficient mechanical stability into polymer electrolyte membranes, while maintaining the ionic conductivity at levels similar to corresponding solvent-free homopolymer electrolytes. This ability to simultaneously control conductivity and mechanical integrity provides opportunities for the fabrication of sturdy, yet easily processable, solid-state lithium batteries. In this review, we first introduce several fundamental studies of ion conduction in homopolymers for the understanding of ion transport in the conducting domain of BCP systems. Then, we summarize recent experimental studies of BCP electrolytes with respect to the effects of salt-doping and morphology on ionic conductivity. Finally, we present some remaining challenges for BCP electrolytes and highlight several important areas for future research. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

209,10.1002/adfm.201500589,2015.0,A Robust Ion‐Conductive Biopolymer as a Binder for Si Anodes of Lithium‐Ion Batteries,"Binders have been reported to play a key role in improving the cycle performance of Si anode materials of lithium‐ion batteries. In this study, the biopolymer guar gum (GG) is applied as the binder for a silicon nanoparticle (SiNP) anode of a lithium‐ion battery for the first time. Due to the large number of polar hydroxyl groups in the GG molecule, a robust interaction between the GG binder and the SiNPs is achieved, resulting in a stable Si anode during cycling. More specifically, the GG binder can effectively transfer lithium ions to the Si surface, similarly to polyethylene oxide solid electrolytes. When GG is used as a binder, the SiNP anode can deliver an initial discharge capacity as high as 3364 mAh g−1, with a Coulombic efficiency of 88.3% at the current density of 2100 mA g−1, and maintain a capacity of 1561 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles. The study shows that the electrochemical performance of the SiNP anode with GG binder is significantly improved compared to that of a SiNP anode with a sodium alginate binder, and it demonstrates that GG is a promising binder for Si anodes of lithium‐ion batteries."
210,10.1021/acsami.5b07730,2015.0,Effective Suppression of Dendritic Lithium Growth Using an Ultrathin Coating of Nitrogen and Sulfur Codoped Graphene Nanosheets on Polymer Separator for Lithium Metal Batteries.,"The enhanced stability of lithium metal is vital to the development of high energy density lithium batteries due to its higher specific capacity and low redox potential. Herein, we demonstrate that nitrogen and sulfur codoped graphene (NSG) nanosheets coated on a polyethylene separator stabilized the lithium electrode in lithium metal batteries by effectively suppressing dendrite growth and maintaining a uniform ionic flux on the metal surface. The ultrathin layer of NSG nanosheets also improved the dimensional stability of the polymer separator at elevated temperatures. In addition, the enhanced interfacial interaction between the NSG-coated separator and lithium metal via electrostatic attraction released the surface tension of lithium metal and suppressed the initiation of dendrite growth on lithium metal. As a result, the electrochemical performance of a lithium metal cell composed of a LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 positive electrode with an NSG-coated separator was remarkably improved as compared to the cell with an uncoated polyethylene separator."
211,10.1021/nn503921j,2014.0,Prediction and characterization of MXene nanosheet anodes for non-lithium-ion batteries.,"Rechargeable non-lithium-ion (Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), and Al(3+)) batteries have attracted great attention as emerging low-cost and high energy-density technologies for large-scale renewable energy storage applications. However, the development of these batteries is hindered by the limited choice of high-performance electrode materials. In this work, MXene nanosheets, a class of two-dimensional transition-metal carbides, are predicted to serve as high-performing anodes for non-lithium-ion batteries by combined first-principles simulations and experimental measurements. Both O-terminated and bare MXenes are shown to be promising anode materials with high capacities and good rate capabilities, while bare MXenes show better performance. Our experiments clearly demonstrate the feasibility of Na- and K-ion intercalation into terminated MXenes. Moreover, stable multilayer adsorption is predicted for Mg and Al, which significantly increases their theoretical capacities. We also show that O-terminated MXenes can decompose into bare MXenes and metal oxides when in contact with Mg, Ca, or Al. Our results provide insight into metal ion storage mechanisms on two-dimensional materials and suggest a route to preparing bare MXene nanosheets."
212,10.1149/1945-7111/ac6d13,2022.0,"Review—""Knees"" in Lithium-Ion Battery Aging Trajectories","
 Lithium-ion batteries can last many years but sometimes exhibit rapid, nonlinear degradation that severely limits battery lifetime. Here, we review prior work on “knees” in lithium-ion battery aging trajectories. We first review definitions for knees and three classes of “internal state trajectories” (termed snowball, hidden, and threshold trajectories) that can cause a knee. We then discuss six knee “pathways”, including lithium plating, electrode saturation, resistance growth, electrolyte and additive depletion, percolation-limited connectivity, and mechanical deformation, some of which have internal state trajectories with signals that are electrochemically undetectable. We also identify key design and usage sensitivities for knees. Finally, we discuss challenges and opportunities for knee modeling and prediction. Our findings illustrate the complexity and subtlety of lithium-ion battery degradation and can aid both academic and industrial efforts to improve battery lifetime."

However, the insulating properties and polysulfide shuttle effects of the sulfur cathode and safety concerns of the lithium anode in liquid electrolytes are still key limitations to practical use of traditional Li–S batteries. In this review, we start with a brief discussion on fundamentals of Li–S batteries and key challenges associated with conventional liquid cells. We then introduce the most recent progress in liquid systems, including sulfur positive electrodes, lithium negative electrodes, and electrolytes and binders. We discuss the significance of investigating electrode reaction mechanisms in liquid cells using in situ techniques to monitor the compositional and morphological changes. We also discuss the importance of this game-changing shift, moving from traditional liquid cells to recently developed solid cells, with positive advances in both solid electrolytes and electrode materials. Finally, the opportunities and perspectives for future research on Li–S batteries are presented."

Typically, Li-S batteries operate by conversion of sulfur to reversibly form different soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates and insoluble lithium sulfides through multistep redox reactions. Herein, we report a functional electrolyte system incorporating dimethyl disulfide as a co-solvent that enables a new electrochemical reduction pathway for sulfur cathodes. This pathway uses soluble dimethyl polysulfides and lithium organosulfides as intermediates and products, which can boost cell capacity and lead to improved discharge-charge reversibility and cycling performance of sulfur cathodes. This electrolyte system can potentially enable Li-S batteries to achieve high energy density."

219,10.1021/jacs.5b04526,2015.0,Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase-Protected LixSi Nanoparticles: An Efficient and Stable Prelithiation Reagent for Lithium-Ion Batteries.,"Prelithiation is an important strategy to compensate for lithium loss in lithium-ion batteries, particularly during the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) from reduced electrolytes in the first charging cycle. We recently demonstrated that LixSi nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by thermal alloying can serve as a high-capacity prelithiation reagent, although their chemical stability in the battery processing environment remained to be improved. Here we successfully developed a surface modification method to enhance the stability of LixSi NPs by exploiting the reduction of 1-fluorodecane on the LixSi surface to form a continuous and dense coating through a reaction process similar to SEI formation. The coating, consisting of LiF and lithium alkyl carbonate with long hydrophobic carbon chains, serves as an effective passivation layer in the ambient environment. Remarkably, artificial-SEI-protected LixSi NPs show a high prelithiation capacity of 2100 mA h g(-1) with negligible capacity decay in dry air after 5 days and maintain a high capacity of 1600 mA h g(-1) in humid air (∼10% relative humidity). Silicon, tin, and graphite were successfully prelithiated with these NPs to eliminate the irreversible first-cycle capacity loss. The use of prelithiation reagents offers a new approach to realize next-generation high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries."

Potential candidates include lithium sulfur batteries based on a lithium sulfide (Li2S) cathode material, which overcome many of the problems associated with other lithium sulfur battery designs. The downside of this is that Li2S has a sluggish activation process, and so, in a bid to overcome this shortcoming, various studies have aimed at better understanding the activation mechanism of this material so that it can be more effectively utilized. An overview of these efforts, as well as of the various full‐cell systems that have been subsequently developed based on Li2S cathodes in combination with different anode materials such as silicon nanowires, silicon thin films, and tin composites is provided."
222,10.1021/nn2006249,2011.0,Doped graphene sheets as anode materials with superhigh rate and large capacity for lithium ion batteries.,"One great challenge in the development of lithium ion batteries is to simultaneously achieve high power and large energy capacity at fast charge and discharge rates for several minutes to seconds. Here we show that nitrogen- or boron-doped graphene can be used as a promising anode for high-power and high-energy lithium ion batteries under high-rate charge and discharge conditions. The doped graphene shows a high reversible capacity of >1040 mAh g(-1) at a low rate of 50 mA g(-1). More importantly, it can be quickly charged and discharged in a very short time of 1 h to several tens of seconds together with high-rate capability and excellent long-term cyclability. For example, a very high capacity of ∼199 and 235 mAh g(-1) was obtained for the N-doped graphene and B-doped graphene at 25 A g(-1) (about 30 s to full charge). We believe that the unique two-dimensional structure, disordered surface morphology, heteroatomic defects, better electrode/electrolyte wettability, increased intersheet distance, improved electrical conductivity, and thermal stability of the doped graphene are beneficial to rapid surface Li(+) absorption and ultrafast Li(+) diffusion and electron transport, and thus make the doped materials superior to those of pristine chemically derived graphene and other carbonaceous materials."
223,10.1021/ja308170k,2012.0,Smaller sulfur molecules promise better lithium-sulfur batteries.,"The lithium-sulfur battery holds a high theoretical energy density, 4-5 times that of today's lithium-ion batteries, yet its applications have been hindered by poor electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode and, most importantly, the rapid fading of its capacity due to the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates (Li(2)S(n), n = 4-8). Despite numerous efforts concerning this issue, combatting sulfur loss remains one of the greatest challenges. Here we show that this problem can be effectively diminished by controlling the sulfur as smaller allotropes. Metastable small sulfur molecules of S(2-4) were synthesized in the confined space of a conductive microporous carbon matrix. The confined S(2-4) as a new cathode material can totally avoid the unfavorable transition between the commonly used large S(8) and S(4)(2-). Li-S batteries based on this concept exhibit unprecedented electrochemical behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and superior rate capability, which promise a practicable battery with high energy density for applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage systems."

Selective growth of Mn(3)O(4) nanoparticles on RGO sheets, in contrast to free particle growth in solution, allowed for the electrically insulating Mn(3)O(4) nanoparticles to be wired up to a current collector through the underlying conducting graphene network. The Mn(3)O(4) nanoparticles formed on RGO show a high specific capacity up to ∼900 mAh/g, near their theoretical capacity, with good rate capability and cycling stability, owing to the intimate interactions between the graphene substrates and the Mn(3)O(4) nanoparticles grown atop. The Mn(3)O(4)/RGO hybrid could be a promising candidate material for a high-capacity, low-cost, and environmentally friendly anode for lithium ion batteries. Our growth-on-graphene approach should offer a new technique for the design and synthesis of battery electrodes based on highly insulating materials."

226,10.1002/aenm.201401302,2015.0,Hybrid and Aqueous Lithium‐Air Batteries,"Lithium‐air (Li‐air) batteries have become attractive because of their extremely high theoretical energy density. However, conventional Li‐air cells operating with non‐aqueous electrolytes suffer from poor cycle life and low practical energy density due to the clogging of the porous air cathode by insoluble discharge products, contamination of the organic electrolyte and lithium metal anode by moist air, and decomposition of the electrolyte during cycling. These difficulties may be overcome by adopting a cell configuration that consists of a lithium‐metal anode protected from air by a Li+‐ion solid electrolyte and an air electrode in an aqueous catholyte. In this type of configuration, a Li+‐ion conducting “buffer” layer between the lithium‐metal anode and the solid electrolyte is often necessary due to the instability of many solid electrolytes in contact with lithium metal. Based on the type of buffer layer, two different battery configurations are possible: “hybrid” Li‐air batteries and “aqueous” Li‐air batteries. The hybrid and aqueous Li‐air batteries utilize the same battery chemistry and face similar challenges that limit the cell performance. Here, an overview of recent developments in hybrid and aqueous Li‐air batteries is provided and the factors that influence their performance and impede their practical applications, followed by future directions are discussed."

229,10.1039/C3EE42223B,2014.0,Ionic shield for polysulfides towards highly-stable lithium–sulfur batteries,"Lithium–sulfur batteries attract great attention due to their high energy density, while their real applications are still hindered by the rapid capacity degradation. Despite great efforts devoted to solving the polysulfide shuttle between the cathode and anode electrodes, it remains a serious challenge to build highly-stable lithium–sulfur batteries. Herein we demonstrate a strategy of introducing an ion selective membrane to improve the stability and coulombic efficiency of lithium–sulfur batteries. The sulfonate-ended perfluoroalkyl ether groups on the ionic separators are connected by pores or channels that are around several nanometers in size. These SO3− groups-coated channels allow ion hopping of positively charged species (Li+) but reject hopping of negative ions, such as polysulfide anions (Sn2−) in this specific case due to the coulombic interactions. Consequently, this cation permselective membrane acts as an electrostatic shield for polysulfide anions, and confines the polysulfides on the cathode side. An ultra-low decay rate of 0.08% per cycle is achieved within the initial 500 cycles for the membrane developed in this work, which is less than half that of the routine membranes. Such an ion selective membrane is versatile for various electrodes and working conditions, which is promising for the construction of high performance batteries."

These battery designs require high-performance, safe and cost effective electrolytes that are compatible with optimized electrode materials. Solid electrolytes have not yet been extensively employed in commercial batteries as they suffer from poor ionic conduction at acceptable temperatures and insufficient stability with respect to lithium-metal. Here we show a novel type of glasses, which evolve from an antiperovskite structure and that show the highest ionic conductivity ever reported for the Li-ion (25 mS cm−1 at 25 °C). These glassy electrolytes for lithium batteries are inexpensive, light, recyclable, non-flammable and non-toxic.

It demonstrates that PFPEs may be used as a major component in operating batteries. These electrolytes not only are completely nonflammable, but they also exhibit unprecedented high transference numbers and low electrochemical polarization, indicative of longer battery life. The results in this work may represent a significant step toward a lithium-ion battery with improved safety and pave the way for the development of new electrolytes that can address the persisting challenges of current battery technologies. The flammability of conventional alkyl carbonate electrolytes hinders the integration of large-scale lithium-ion batteries in transportation and grid storage applications. In this study, we have prepared a unique nonflammable electrolyte composed of low molecular weight perfluoropolyethers and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt. These electrolytes exhibit thermal stability beyond 200 °C and a remarkably high transference number of at least 0.91 (more than double that of conventional electrolytes). Li/LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cells made with this electrolyte show good performance in galvanostatic cycling, confirming their potential as rechargeable lithium batteries with enhanced safety and longevity."
232,10.1039/c6cs00776g,2017.0,Sodium-ion batteries: present and future.,"Energy production and storage technologies have attracted a great deal of attention for day-to-day applications. In recent decades, advances in lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology have improved living conditions around the globe. LIBs are used in most mobile electronic devices as well as in zero-emission electronic vehicles. However, there are increasing concerns regarding load leveling of renewable energy sources and the smart grid as well as the sustainability of lithium sources due to their limited availability and consequent expected price increase. Therefore, whether LIBs alone can satisfy the rising demand for small- and/or mid-to-large-format energy storage applications remains unclear. To mitigate these issues, recent research has focused on alternative energy storage systems. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as the best candidate power sources because sodium is widely available and exhibits similar chemistry to that of LIBs; therefore, SIBs are promising next-generation alternatives. Recently, sodiated layer transition metal oxides, phosphates and organic compounds have been introduced as cathode materials for SIBs. Simultaneously, recent developments have been facilitated by the use of select carbonaceous materials, transition metal oxides (or sulfides), and intermetallic and organic compounds as anodes for SIBs. Apart from electrode materials, suitable electrolytes, additives, and binders are equally important for the development of practical SIBs. Despite developments in electrode materials and other components, there remain several challenges, including cell design and electrode balancing, in the application of sodium ion cells. In this article, we summarize and discuss current research on materials and propose future directions for SIBs. This will provide important insights into scientific and practical issues in the development of SIBs."

Here, we present a self-consistent material-to-system analysis of the best-case mass, volume, and cost values for the nonaqueous lithium–oxygen battery and compare them with current and advanced lithium-based batteries using metal-oxide positive electrodes. Surprisingly, despite their high theoretical specific energy, lithium–oxygen systems were projected to achieve parity with other candidate chemistries as a result of the requirement to deliver and purify or to enclose the gaseous oxygen reactant. The theoretical specific energy, which leads to predictions of an order of magnitude improvement over a traditional lithium-ion battery, is shown to be an inadequate predictor of systems-level cost, volume, and mass. This analysis reveals the importance of system-level considerations and identifies the reversible lithium-metal negative electrode as a common, critical high-risk technology needed for batteries to reach long-term automotive objectives. Additionally, advanced lithium-ion technology was found to be a moderate risk pathway to achieve the majority of volume and cost reductions."

Based on the analysis of some of the most popular model-based SOC estimation methods, the proportional-integral (PI) observer is proposed to estimate the SOC of lithium-ion batteries in EDVs. The structure of the proposed PI observer is analyzed, and the convergence of the estimation method with model errors is verified. To demonstrate the superiority and compensation properties of the proposed PI observer, the simple-structure RC battery model is utilized to model the Li-ion battery. To validate the results of the proposed PI-based SOC estimation method, the experimental battery test bench is established. In the validation, the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) drive cycle is utilized, and the PI-based SOC estimation results are found to agree with the reference SOC, generally within the 2% error band for both the known and unknown initial SOC cases."

We report here the organic-electrolyte-dissolved iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as a shuttle of (O2)(-) species and electrons between the surface of the electronic conductor and the insulator Li2O2 product of discharge. The Li2O2 is observed to grow and decompose without direct contact with carbon, which greatly enhances the electrochemical performance. Our results signal that the use of molecular shuttles that are catalytically active may prove to be enablers of a practical lithium-air rechargeable battery."

Initially, we recall the main models for ion transport and the structure-transport relationships at the basis of the observed conductivity behaviours. Emphasis is then placed on the physico-chemical and functional parameters relevant for optimal electrolytes preparation, as well as on the techniques of choice for their evaluation.

By protecting the electrode and passing lithium ions, the SEI plays an important role in the performance and degradation of lithium ion batteries. Identifying how the SEI forms and evolves during battery cycling helps us understand and mitigate battery degradation. In this work, we address the SEI chemical and electrochemical evolution during its formation process and provide a correlation between these properties. It is found that the SEI chemistry, not just its thickness, has a distinct influence on its impedance, which may ultimately impact the battery performance."
245,10.1557/MRS.2014.86,2014.0,Lithium-sulfur batteries,"Markets for energy storage that go beyond portable electronics have emerged rapidly this decade, including powering electric vehicles and “leveling the grid” fed by renewable sources such as solar energy, which are intermittent in supply. These new demands require a significant step-up in energy density that will probably not be met by Li-ion batteries; estimates suggest they are starting to approach their theoretical limits. But in the world of “beyond Li-ion,” the options are limited. One of the most hopeful is the Li-S battery, for which greater energy storage can potentially be realized through phase-transformation chemistry using elemental sulfur as a positive electrode material, which converts to lithium sulfide. These future generation systems offer up to a five-fold increased specific energy and greatly reduced cost factors, but commercialization has been hindered owing to key challenges. Efforts over the last two years to better manipulate the cell chemistry and overcome these challenges are presented."
246,10.1039/C3EE23966G,2013.0,Lithium–oxygen batteries: bridging mechanistic understanding and battery performance,"Rechargeable energy storage systems with high energy density and round-trip efficiency are urgently needed to capture and deliver renewable energy for applications such as electric transportation. Lithium–air/lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries have received extraordinary research attention recently owing to their potential to provide positive electrode gravimetric energies considerably higher (∼3 to 5×) than Li-ion positive electrodes, although the packaged device energy density advantage will be lower (∼2×). In light of the major technological challenges of Li–O2 batteries, we discuss current understanding developed in non-carbonate electrolytes of Li–O2 redox chemistry upon discharge and charge, oxygen reduction reaction product characteristics upon discharge, and the chemical instability of electrolytes and carbon commonly used in the oxygen electrode. We show that the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction are influenced by catalysts at small discharge capacities (Li2O2 thickness less than ∼1 nm), but not at large Li2O2 thicknesses, yielding insights into the governing processes during discharge. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of discharge products (mainly Li2O2) including morphological, electronic and surface features and parasitic reactivity with carbon. On charge, we examine the reaction mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction from Li2O2 and the influence of catalysts on bulk Li2O2 decomposition. These analyses provide insights into major discrepancies regarding Li–O2 charge kinetics and the role of catalyst. In light of these findings, we highlight open questions and challenges in the Li–O2 field relevant to developing practical, reversible batteries that achieve the anticipated energy density advantage with a long cycle life."

Lithium–sulfur batteries have attracted much attention in recent years due to their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, lithium–sulfur batteries have not been commercialized because of their intrinsic shortcomings, including the insulation of the active cathode materials, the high solubility of lithium polysulfides in organic liquid electrolytes, and the lithium dendrite in the anode. In this feature article, recent research progress in cathode materials, electrolytes, anode materials, and others is reviewed and commented upon. Some perspectives and directions on future development of lithium–sulfur batteries are pointed out based on knowledge from previous studies and our experience."
248,10.1109/ECCE.2014.6954027,2014.0,Diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries state-of-health based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique,"Lithium-ion batteries have developed into a popular energy storage choice for a wide range of applications because of their superior characteristics in comparison to other energy storage technologies. Besides modelling the performance behavior of Lithium-ion batteries, it has become of huge interest to accurately diagnose their state-of-health (SOH). At present, Lithium-ion batteries are diagnosed by performing capacity or resistance (current pulse) measurements; however, in the majority of the cases, these measurements are time consuming and result in changing the state of the battery as well. This paper investigates the use of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique for SOH diagnosis of Lithium-ion battery cells, instead of using the aforementioned techniques, since this new method allows for online and direct measurement of the battery cell response in any working point. For the investigation, a 2.5 Ah Lithium-ion battery cell based on lithium iron phosphate and graphite (LiFePO4/C), as active material, was used. The obtained results at different battery SOH levels have been analyzed in detail and are suggesting that the EIS technique represents a promising tool for diagnosis the lithium-ion battery cells' SOH; meaningful results regarding the pulse power capability decrease of the tested Li-ion battery cells were obtained by applying the EIS technique."
249,10.1002/adfm.201202623,2013.0,Reconstruction of Conformal Nanoscale MnO on Graphene as a High‐Capacity and Long‐Life Anode Material for Lithium Ion Batteries,"To tackle the issue of inferior cycle stability and rate capability for MnO anode materials in lithium ion batteries, a facile strategy is explored to prepare a hybrid material consisting of MnO nanocrystals grown on conductive graphene nanosheets. The prepared MnO/graphene hybrid anode exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 2014.1 mAh g−1 after 150 discharge/charge cycles at 200 mA g−1, excellent rate capability (625.8 mAh g−1 at 3000 mA g−1), and superior cyclability (843.3 mAh g−1 even after 400 discharge/charge cycles at 2000 mA g−1 with only 0.01% capacity loss per cycle). The results suggest that the reconstruction of the MnO/graphene electrodes is intrinsic due to conversion reactions. A long‐term stable nanoarchitecture of graphene‐supported ultrafine manganese oxide nanoparticles is formed upon cycling, which yields a long‐life anode material for lithium ion batteries. The lithiation and delithiation behavior suggests that the further oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(IV) and the interfacial lithium storage upon cycling contribute to the enhanced specific capacity. The excellent rate capability benefits from the presence of conductive graphene and a short transportation length for both lithium ions and electrons. Moreover, the as‐formed hybrid nanostructure of MnO on graphene may help achieve faster kinetics of conversion reactions."
250,10.1021/es400614y,2013.0,Potential environmental and human health impacts of rechargeable lithium batteries in electronic waste.,"Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (Li-poly) batteries have recently become dominant in consumer electronic products because of advantages associated with energy density and product longevity. However, the small size of these batteries, the high rate of disposal of consumer products in which they are used, and the lack of uniform regulatory policy on their disposal means that lithium batteries may contribute substantially to environmental pollution and adverse human health impacts due to potentially toxic materials. In this research, we used standardized leaching tests, life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and hazard assessment models to evaluate hazardous waste classification, resource depletion potential, and toxicity potentials of lithium batteries used in cellphones. Our results demonstrate that according to U.S. federal regulations, defunct Li-ion batteries are classified hazardous due to their lead (Pb) content (average 6.29 mg/L; σ = 11.1; limit 5). However, according to California regulations, all lithium batteries tested are classified hazardous due to excessive levels of cobalt (average 163,544 mg/kg; σ = 62,897; limit 8000), copper (average 98,694 mg/kg; σ = 28,734; limit 2500), and nickel (average 9525 mg/kg; σ = 11,438; limit 2000). In some of the Li-ion batteries, the leached concentrations of chromium, lead, and thallium exceeded the California regulation limits. The environmental impact associated with resource depletion and human toxicity is mainly associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver, whereas the ecotoxicity potential is primarily associated with cobalt, copper, nickel, thallium, and silver. However, the relative contribution of aluminum and lithium to human toxicity and ecotoxicity could not be estimated due to insufficient toxicity data in the models. These findings support the need for stronger government policy at the local, national, and international levels to encourage recovery, recycling, and reuse of lithium battery materials."
251,10.1039/C4TA00716F,2014.0,Flexible rechargeable lithium ion batteries: advances and challenges in materials and process technologies,"Flexible batteries possess several unique features including high flexibility, lightweight and easy portability, high specific power and energy density, and remarkable rate capability, etc. So far, many different kinds of flexible batteries have been invented. The batteries, according to the electrochemical processes in a cell, can be categorized as flexible alkaline batteries, plastic batteries (or all-polymer batteries), polymer lithium-metal batteries (with lithium foil as an anode), and flexible rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs), etc. Among these, flexible LIBs attract more rapidly increasing attention. As compared to the conventional rechargeable LIBs, fabrication of flexible LIBs is more challenging. An optimal match among the core components, i.e., nanostructured electrode materials, shape-conformable solid electrolytes, and soft current collectors should be achieved, so that the batteries maintain stable electrochemical performances even though they are deformed to fit the powered devices. Thus, fabrication of such batteries is not cost-effective and hence, is also inefficient. In the search for the potential core components for flexible LIBs, much progress has been made in screening solid state electrolytes, soft current collectors and electrode materials, and in electrode design and full LIB cell assembly (particularly in managing to get the three core components to work harmonically). There are also studies focusing on fundamental understanding and simulation of fully flexible LIBs. They reliably anticipate and describe the battery performances that are not easily explored experimentally using the present state-of-the-art technologies. In this review, we systematically summarize the advances in flexible LIBs research, with focus on the development of flexible electrodes. The review proceeds in terms of the processes for making electrodes and full LIB cells so as to emphasize the materials and process technologies. The development of solid state electrolytes and the fundamental understanding and simulation of flexible LIBs are also addressed. The review concludes with a perspective according to the author's experience in the related field, and the potential application of printing processes in flexible LIB fabrication is especially emphasized."

Nanochemistry has advantageous roles to overcome these problems by defining new nanostructures of electrode materials. This review article will highlight the challenges associated with these chemistries both to bring high performance and longevity upon considering the working principles of the various types of lithium‐based (Li‐ion, Li‐air and Li‐S) batteries.

The advantage of anodes based on coated lithium powder (CLiP), compared to plain lithium foil, include the suppression of dendrite formation, as the local current density during stripping/plating is reduced due to the higher surface area. Another performance and safety advantage of lithium powder is the precisely controlled mass loading of the lithium anode during electrode preparation, giving the opportunity to avoid Li excess in the cell. As an additional benefit, the coating makes electrode manufacturing safer and eases handling. Here, electrodes based on coated lithium powder electrodes (CLiP) are introduced for application in lithium‐metal batteries. These electrodes are compared to lithium foil electrodes with respect to cycling stability, coulombic efficiency of lithium stripping/plating, overpotential, and morphology changes during cycling."
255,10.1039/C4EE02192D,2014.0,"Lithium–sulfur batteries—the solution is in the electrolyte, but is the electrolyte a solution?","At first glance, the combination of the lightest, most electropositive metal (lithium) with a safe, abundant (and reasonably light) non-metal (sulfur) makes good sense as a prospective battery. However, while the lithium–sulfur battery offers a very high theoretical specific energy (∼2600 W h kg−1) the actual performance delivered is proving to be severely limited—in many cases, this is directly related to the role of the electrolyte. The fundamental issue is that the reduction of sulfur proceeds through a series of polysulfide species, which are for the most part soluble in common organic solvents, including those employed in battery electrolyte solutions. So, despite the fact that the ultimate product (Li2S) is essentially insoluble, the intermediate stages of discharge see a migration of redox-active species out of the cathode, from where they can react with the lithium anode, which sets in train a series of equilibria that cause both a loss of charging efficiency and a gradual loss of discharge capacity. In the last decade, a major stream of the research to overcome this complex situation has focused on minimizing the solubility of polysulfides. From this we now have a range of media in which the lithium–sulfur system can operate with much improved charge–discharge characteristics: ionic liquids (and blends with organic media); super-saturated salt-solvent mixtures; polymer-gelled organic media; solid polymers; solid inorganic glasses. Underlining the multi-faceted nature of interactions within the lithium–sulfur cell, though, none of these improved electrolytes has been able to bring the performance of this system up to the levels of reliability and capacity maintenance (without sacrificing high specific energy) that are benchmarks in energy storage applications. Our survey indicates that only by combining particular electrolytes with cathode materials that are designed to actively retain sulfur and its reduction products, have a relatively few studies been able to obtain the desired levels of performance. Ultimately the successful development of the lithium–sulfur battery requires careful coordination of the choice of modified electrolyte with the specific nature of the cathode material, underpinned by the assumption that the resulting electrolyte composition will meet established criteria for compatibility with the lithium anode."
256,10.1002/aenm.201200346,2013.0,Electrochemical Performance of Porous Carbon/Tin Composite Anodes for Sodium‐Ion and Lithium‐Ion Batteries,"The electrochemical performance of mesoporous carbon (C)/tin (Sn) anodes in Na‐ion and Li‐ion batteries is systematically investigated. The mesoporous C/Sn anodes in a Na‐ion battery shows similar cycling stability but lower capacity and poorer rate capability than that in a Li‐ion battery. The desodiation potentials of Sn anodes are approximately 0.21 V lower than delithiation potentials. The low capacity and poor rate capability of C/Sn anode in Na‐ion batteries is mainly due to the large Na‐ion size, resulting in slow Na‐ion diffusion and large volume change of porous C/Sn composite anode during alloy/dealloy reactions. Understanding of the reaction mechanism between Sn and Na ions will provide insight towards exploring and designing new alloy‐based anode materials for Na‐ion batteries."

However, the sustainability concerns of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and next-generation rechargeable batteries have received little attention. Recycling plays an important role in the overall sustainability of future batteries and is affected by battery attributes including environmental hazards and the value of their constituent resources. Therefore, recycling should be considered when developing battery systems. Herein, we provide a systematic overview of rechargeable battery sustainability. With a particular focus on electric vehicles, we analyze the market competitiveness of batteries in terms of economy, environment, and policy. Considering the large volumes of batteries soon to be retired, we comprehensively evaluate battery utilization and recycling from the perspectives of economic feasibility, environmental impact, technology, and safety. Battery sustainability is discussed with respect to life-cycle assessment and analyzed from the perspectives of strategic resources and economic demand. Finally, we propose a 4H strategy for battery recycling with the aims of high efficiency, high economic return, high environmental benefit, and high safety. New challenges and future prospects for battery sustainability are also highlighted."

The reduction of graphene oxide and the formation/binding of sulfur nanocrystals were integrated. The G-S hybrids exhibit a highly porous network structure constructed by fibrous graphene, many electrically conducting pathways, and easily tunable sulfur content, which can be cut and pressed into pellets to be directly used as lithium-sulfur battery cathodes without using a metal current-collector, binder, and conductive additive. The porous network and sulfur nanocrystals enable rapid ion transport and short Li(+) diffusion distance, the interconnected fibrous graphene provides highly conductive electron transport pathways, and the oxygen-containing (mainly hydroxyl/epoxide) groups show strong binding with polysulfides, preventing their dissolution into the electrolyte based on first-principles calculations. As a result, the G-S hybrids show a high capacity, an excellent high-rate performance, and a long life over 100 cycles. These results demonstrate the great potential of this unique hybrid structure as cathodes for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries."

However, these renewable energies are dependent on the time and season. Consequently, energy storage systems are needed to fully utilize these energies including their connection with smart grids. Aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) may be an ideal energy storage system due to its excellent safety and reliability. However, since the introduction of ARLBs in 1994, the progress on improving their performance has been very limited. Recently, their rate performance, especially superfast charging performance, reversible capacity and cycling life of their electrode materials were markedly improved. The present work reviews the latest advances in the exploration of the electrode materials and the development of battery systems.

However, their electrically insulating nature plagues efficient charge transport within the electroactive bulk. Alternative to the popular solution of elaborating nanocomposite materials, herein we report on a molecular‐level engineering strategy towards high‐power organic electrode materials with multi‐electron reactions. Systematic comparisons of anthraquinone analogues incorporating fused heteroaromatic structures as cathode materials in rechargeable lithium batteries reveal that the judicious incorporation of heteroaromatics improves the cell performance in terms of specific gravimetric capacity, working potential, rate capability, and cyclability. Combination studies with morphological observation, electrochemical impedance characterization, and theoretical modeling provide insight into the advantage of heteroaromatic building blocks. In particular, benzofuro[5,6‐b]furan‐4,8‐dione (BFFD) bearing furan moeities shows a reversible capacity of 181 mAh g−1 when charged/discharged at 100C, corresponding to a power density of 29.8 kW kg−1.

Suo et al. smash through this limit with an aqueous salt solution containing lithium (Li) bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide to create an electrolyte that has an electrochemical window of 3 V (see the Perspective by Smith and Dunn). They used extremely high-concentration solutions, which suppressed hydrogen evolution and electrode oxidation. At these concentrations, the Li solvation shell changes because there simply is not enough water to neutralize the Li+ charge. Thus, flammable organic electrolytes could potentially be replaced with a safer aqueous alternative. Science, this issue p. 938; see also p. 918 The electrochemical stability window of an aqueous electrolyte is expanded to 3 volts. [Also see Perspective by Smith and Dunn] Lithium-ion batteries raise safety, environmental, and cost concerns, which mostly arise from their nonaqueous electrolytes. The use of aqueous alternatives is limited by their narrow electrochemical stability window (1.23 volts), which sets an intrinsic limit on the practical voltage and energy output. We report a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte whose window was expanded to ~3.0 volts with the formation of an electrode-electrolyte interphase. A full lithium-ion battery of 2.3 volts using such an aqueous electrolyte was demonstrated to cycle up to 1000 times, with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency at both low (0.15 C) and high (4.5 C) discharge and charge rates."

On the other hand, most of the catalyst performances reported thus far are tested using carbonate-based or mixed ether-carbonate-based electrolytes, which have now been shown to be not inert to the superoxide radical (O2C ) and thus are inevitably decomposed upon cell discharge/ charge. For example, Luntz and co-workers demonstrate that, when carbonate-based electrolytes are employed for LiO2 cells, the main role of the Au, Pt, and MnO2 catalysts is to catalyze the decomposition of the electrolytes. In this context, the development of OER and ORR electrocatalysts in a relatively stable electrolyte is thus of importance to realize a reversible Li-O2 battery. Compared to carbonate, ether-based electrolytes have been reported to be more suitable for Li-O2 batteries because the desired lithium peroxide is the dominant product. 29] However, there are not many reports on electrocatalysts for Li-O2 batteries with ether-based electrolytes. 10, 30, 33] Perovskite oxides have a high electronic/ionic conductivity and catalytic activity and thus could be a promising candidate as electrocatalyst for Li-O2 batteries. [33–35] Herein, we firstly propose and realize a facile, effective, and scalable strategy for preparing perovskite-based porous La0.75Sr0.25MnO3 nanotubes (PNT-LSM) by combining the electrospinning technique with a heating method.

Nevertheless, lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from capacity fading, which limits their widespread application, due to the insulating nature of sulfur and its reduced pro ducts and the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysul fides. To address these problems, carbon-based materials have been integrated with sulfur to enhance the conductivity and inhibit the polysulfide dissolutio n. Recently, graphene, a single-atom-thick carbon mate rial with superior electrical conductivity and mechanica l flexibility, has been successfully applied in lithi um-sulfur batteries. While graphene-sulfur composite cathodes  demonstrate promising electrochemical performance, their synthesis is usually complicated and challeng ing for large-scale application. On the other hand, the sol utionbased synthesis without heat treatment produces lar ge crystalline sulfur particles, resulting in low util ization of active materials and poor rate performance. Herein, we report hydroxylated graphene nanosheets as a substr ate to produce graphene-amorphous sulfur nanocomposites, exhibiting superior cyclability at high rates, by a facile in situ deposition method at room temperature."

Here, a novel additive, phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) in organic electrolyte, is reported to boost the cycling performance of Li‐S batteries. The function of the additive is two‐fold: 1) P2S5 promotes the dissolution of Li2S and alleviates the loss of capacity caused by the precipitation of Li2S and 2) P2S5 passivates the surface of lithium metal and therefore eliminates the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon. A Li‐S test cell demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 900–1350 mAh g−1 and a high coulombic efficiency of ≥90% for at least 40 stable cycles at 0.1 C."

These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large‐scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium‐containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identified, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI films.

In rechargeable lithium batteries, researchers have considered many types of nanostructured carbons, such as carbon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nanoporous carbon, as anode materials and, especially, as key components for building advanced composite electrode materials. Nanocarbons can form efficient three-dimensional conducting networks that improve the performance of electrode materials suffering from the limited kinetics of lithium storage. Although the porous structure guarantees a fast migration of Li ions, the nanocarbon network can serve as an effective matrix for dispersing the active materials to prevent them from agglomerating. The nanocarbon network also affords an efficient electron pathway to provide better electrical contacts. Because of their structural stability and flexibility, nanocarbon networks can alleviate the stress and volume changes that occur in active materials during the Li insertion/extraction process. Through the elegant design of hierarchical electrode materials with nanocarbon networks, researchers can improve both the kinetic performance and the structural stability of the electrode material, which leads to optimal battery capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability. This Account summarizes recent progress in the structural design, chemical synthesis, and characterization of the electrochemical properties of nanocarbon networks for Li-ion batteries. In such systems, storage occurs primarily in the non-carbon components, while carbon acts as the conductor and as the structural buffer.

Therefore, research in this field has intensified to produce safer devices with better electrochemical performance. Most research has focused on the development of new electrode materials through the optimization of bulk properties such as crystal structure, ionic diffusivity, and electric conductivity. More recently, researchers have also considered the surface properties of electrodes as critical factors for optimizing performance. In particular, the electrolyte decomposition at the electrode surface relates to both a lithium ion battery's electrochemical performance and safety.

Initially, we present a brief background to lithium ion batteries such as major chemical components and reactions that occur in lithium ion batteries. Then, we highlight the role of surface chemistry in the safety of lithium ion batteries. We examine the thermal stability of cathode materials: For example, we discuss the oxygen generation from cathode materials and describe how cells can swell and heat up in response to specific conditions.

Here ab initio density functional theory with a dispersion correction was used to investigate the stability, magnetic and adsorption properties of nine defects in graphene, including both nitrogen substitutional doping and nitrogen decoration of vacancies. The results indicate that only pyridinic N2V2 defect in graphene shows a ferromagnetic spin structure with high magnetic moment and magnetic stabilization energy. Not all nitrogen-doped defects can improve the capacity of the lithium-ion batteries. The adsorption energies of a lithium atom on nitrogen-substituted graphenes are more positive, indicating that they are meta-stable and no better than the pristine graphene as anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Nitrogen-decorated single and double vacancy defects, especially for the pyridinic N2V2 defect in graphene, can greatly improve the reversible capacity of the battery in comparison with the pristine graphene. The theoretical prediction of the reversible capacity of the battery is 1039 mA h g(-1) for the nitrogen-doped graphene material synthesized by Wu et al., which is in good agreement with the experimental data (1043 mA h g(-1)). The theoretical computations suggest that nitrogen-decorated single and double vacancy defects in graphene are the promising candidate for anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Each nitrogen atom in the decoration can improve the reversible capacity of the battery by 63.3-124.5 mA h g(-1) in a 4 × 4 supercell of graphene.

However, the existing carbon allotropes cannot meet the increasing energy and power demand, and thus there is still a need for further development of new materials for lithium-ion batteries. In the present work, a new graphene allotrope, known as graphenylene, is found to be capable of storing lithium with greater density of energy. Ab initio density functional theory calculations indicate that the unique dodecagonal holes in graphenylene enable lithium ions to diffuse both on and through graphenylene layers with energy barriers no higher than 0.99 eV. Adsorption of a lithium atom on graphenylene is stronger than that on pristine graphene. The highest lithium storage capacities for monolayer and bilayer graphenylene compounds are Li3C6 and Li2.5C6, respectively, which correspond to specific capacities of 1116 and 930 mA h g−1.

We formulate the model by combining fundamental theories of battery degradation and our observations in battery aging test results. The model is adaptable to different types of lithium-ion batteries, and methods for tuning the model coefficients based on manufacturer’s data are presented. A cycle-counting method is incorporated to identify stress cycles from irregular operations, allowing the degradation model to be applied to any battery energy storage (BES) applications. The usefulness of this model is demonstrated through an assessment of the degradation that a BES would incur by providing frequency control in the PJM regulation market."

However, low conductivity of sulfur species, dissolution of polysulfides, poor conversion from sulfur reduction and lithium sulfide (Li2S) oxidation reactions during discharge-charge processes hinder their practical applications. Herein, under the guidance of density functional theory calculations, we have successfully synthesized large-scale single atom vanadium catalysts seeded on graphene to achieve high sulfur content (80 wt% sulfur), fast kinetic (a capacity of 645 mAh g-1 at 3 C rate) and long-life Li-S batteries. Both forward (sulfur reduction) and reverse reactions (Li2S oxidation) are significantly improved by the single atom catalysts. This finding is confirmed by experimental results and consistent with theoretical calculations. The ability of single metal atoms to effectively trap the dissolved lithium polysulﬁdes (LiPSs) and catalytically convert the LiPSs/Li2S during cycling, significantly improved sulfur utilization, rate capability and cycling life. Our work demonstrates an efficient design pathway for single atom catalysts and provides solutions for the development of high energy/power density Li-S batteries."

Originated from the slow redox kinetics of polysulfide intermediates, the flood of polysulfides in the batteries during cycling induced low sulfur utilization, severe polarization, low energy efficiency, deteriorated polysulfide shuttle, and short cycling life. Herein, sulfiphilic cobalt disulfide (CoS2) was incorporated into carbon/sulfur cathodes, introducing strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and CoS2 under working conditions.

328,10.1073/pnas.1708489114,2017.0,An anion-immobilized composite electrolyte for dendrite-free lithium metal anodes,"Significance The Li metal electrode is regarded as a “Holy Grail” anode for next-generation batteries due to its extremely high theoretical capacity and lowest reduction potential. Unfortunately, uncontrolled dendrite growth leads to serious safety issues. This work realizes a dendrite-free Li metal anode by introducing an anion-immobilized composite solid electrolyte, where anions are tethered to polymer chains and ceramic particles. Immobilized anions contribute to uniform distribution of Li ions and dendrite-free Li deposition. The flexible electrolyte can be applied in all–solid-state Li metal batteries with excellent specific capacities. This work demonstrates a concept to adjust ion distribution based on solid-state electrolytes for safe dendrite-free Li anodes, paving the way to practical Li metal batteries. Lithium metal is strongly regarded as a promising electrode material in next-generation rechargeable batteries due to its extremely high theoretical specific capacity and lowest reduction potential. However, the safety issue and short lifespan induced by uncontrolled dendrite growth have hindered the practical applications of lithium metal anodes. Hence, we propose a flexible anion-immobilized ceramic–polymer composite electrolyte to inhibit lithium dendrites and construct safe batteries. Anions in the composite electrolyte are tethered by a polymer matrix and ceramic fillers, inducing a uniform distribution of space charges and lithium ions that contributes to a dendrite-free lithium deposition. The dissociation of anions and lithium ions also helps to reduce the polymer crystallinity, rendering stable and fast transportation of lithium ions. Ceramic fillers in the electrolyte extend the electrochemically stable window to as wide as 5.5 V and provide a barrier to short circuiting for realizing safe batteries at elevated temperature. The anion-immobilized electrolyte can be applied in all–solid-state batteries and exhibits a small polarization of 15 mV. Cooperated with LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes, the all–solid-state lithium metal batteries render excellent specific capacities of above 150 mAh⋅g−1 and well withstand mechanical bending. These results reveal a promising opportunity for safe and flexible next-generation lithium metal batteries."

The dual‐layered interface can protect the Li metal anode from the corrosion of electrolytes and regulate the uniform deposition of Li to achieve a dendrite‐free Li metal anode. This work demonstrates the concept of rational construction of dual‐layered structured interfaces for safe rechargeable batteries through facile surface modification of Li metal anodes. This not only is critically helpful to comprehensively understand the functional mechanism of fluoroethylene carbonate but also affords a facile and efficient method to protect Li metal anodes."
332,10.1039/B904116H,2009.0,Carbon nanotubes for lithium ion batteries,"Lithium ion batteries are receiving considerable attention in applications, ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles, due to their superior energy density over other rechargeable battery technologies. However, the societal demands for lighter, thinner, and higher capacity lithium ion batteries necessitate ongoing research for novel materials with improved properties over that of state-of-the-art. Such an effort requires a concerted development of both electrodes and electrolyte to improve battery capacity, cycle life, and charge–discharge rates while maintaining the highest degree of safety available. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a candidate material for use in lithium ion batteries due to their unique set of electrochemical and mechanical properties. The incorporation of CNTs as a conductive additive at a lower weight loading than conventional carbons, like carbon black and graphite, presents a more effective strategy to establish an electrical percolation network. In addition, CNTs have the capability to be assembled into free-standing electrodes (absent of any binder or current collector) as an active lithium ion storage material or as a physical support for ultra high capacity anode materials like silicon or germanium. The measured reversible lithium ion capacities for CNT-based anodes can exceed 1000 mAh g−1 depending on experimental factors, which is a 3× improvement over conventional graphite anodes. The major advantage from utilizing free-standing CNT anodes is the removal of the copper current collectors which can translate into an increase in specific energy density by more than 50% for the overall battery design. However, a developmental effort needs to overcome current research challenges including the first cycle charge loss and paper crystallinity for free-standing CNT electrodes. Efforts to utilize pre-lithiation methods and modification of the single wall carbon nanotube bundling are expected to increase the energy density of future CNT batteries. Other progress may be achieved using open-ended structures and enriched chiral fractions of semiconducting or metallic chiralities that are potentially able to improve capacity and electrical transport in CNT-based lithium ion batteries."
333,10.1002/aenm.201800933,2018.0,Sulfide Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Battery Applications,"The use of solid electrolytes is a promising direction to improve the energy density of lithium‐ion batteries. However, the low ionic conductivity of many solid electrolytes currently hinders the performance of solid‐state batteries. Sulfide solid electrolytes can be processed in a number of forms (glass, glass‐ceramic, and crystalline) and have a wide range of available chemistries. Crystalline sulfide materials demonstrate ionic conductivity on par with those of liquid electrolytes through the utilization of near ideal conduction pathways. Low‐temperature processing is also possible for these materials due to their favorable mechanical properties. The main drawback of sulfide solid electrolytes remains their electrochemical stability, but this can be addressed through compositional tuning or the use of artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Implementation of sulfide solid electrolytes, with proper treatment for stability, can lead to substantial improvements in solid‐state battery performance leading to significant advancement in electric vehicle technology."

However, both dendritic lithium deposition and infinity dimension change during long‐term cycling have extremely restricted its practical applications for energy storage devices. Here, a thermal infusion strategy for prestoring lithium into a stable nickel foam host is demonstrated and a composite anode is achieved. In comparison with the bare lithium, the composite anode exhibits stable voltage profiles (200 mV at 5.0 mA cm−2) with a small hysteresis beyond 100 cycles in carbonate‐based electrolyte, as well as high rate capability, significantly reduced interfacial resistance, and small polarization in a full‐cell battery with Li4Ti5O12 or LiFePO4 as counter electrode. More importantly, in addition to the fact that lithium is successfully confined in the metallic nickel foam host, uniform lithium plating/stripping is achieved with a low dimension change (merely ≈3.1%) and effective inhibition of dendrite formation. The mechanism for uniform lithium stripping/plating behavior is explained based on a surface energy model."

Garnet-based solid-state electrolytes have attracted much attention for their high ionic conductivities and stability with lithium metal anodes. However, high-interface resistance with lithium anodes hinders their application to lithium metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin, conformal ZnO surface coating by atomic layer deposition for improved wettability of garnet solid-state electrolytes to molten lithium that significantly decreases the interface resistance to as low as ∼20 Ω·cm2. The ZnO coating demonstrates a high reactivity with lithium metal, which is systematically characterized. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully infiltrated lithium metal into porous garnet electrolyte, which can potentially serve as a self-supported lithium metal composite anode having both high ionic and electrical conductivity for solid-state lithium metal batteries. The facile surface treatment method offers a simple strategy to solve the interface problem in solid-state lithium metal batteries with garnet solid electrolytes."

With larger storage capacity at a fraction of the cost compared to lithium-ion, zinc-air batteries clearly represent one of the most viable future options to powering electric vehicles. However, some technical problems associated with them have yet to be resolved. In this review, we present the fundamentals, challenges and latest exciting advances related to zinc-air research. Detailed discussion will be organized around the individual components of the system - from zinc electrodes, electrolytes, and separators to air electrodes and oxygen electrocatalysts in sequential order for both primary and electrically/mechanically rechargeable types. The detrimental effect of CO2 on battery performance is also emphasized, and possible solutions summarized.

Amorphous silicon was coated onto carbon nanofibers to form a core-shell structure and the resulted core-shell nanowires showed great performance as anode material. Since carbon has a much smaller capacity compared to silicon, the carbon core experiences less structural stress or damage during lithium cycling and can function as a mechanical support and an efficient electron conducting pathway. These nanowires have a high charge storage capacity of approximately 2000 mAh/g and good cycling life. They also have a high Coulmbic efficiency of 90% for the first cycle and 98-99.6% for the following cycles. A full cell composed of LiCoO(2) cathode and carbon-silicon core-shell nanowire anode is also demonstrated. Significantly, using these core-shell nanowires we have obtained high mass loading and an area capacity of approximately 4 mAh/cm(2), which is comparable to commercial battery values."
338,10.1021/nl100086e,2010.0,Arrays of sealed silicon nanotubes as anodes for lithium ion batteries.,"Silicon is a promising candidate for electrodes in lithium ion batteries due to its large theoretical energy density. Poor capacity retention, caused by pulverization of Si during cycling, frustrates its practical application. We have developed a nanostructured form of silicon, consisting of arrays of sealed, tubular geometries that is capable of accommodating large volume changes associated with lithiation in battery applications. Such electrodes exhibit high initial Coulombic efficiencies (i.e., >85%) and stable capacity-retention (>80% after 50 cycles), due to an unusual, underlying mechanics that is dominated by free surfaces. This physics is manifested by a strongly anisotropic expansion in which 400% volumetric increases are accomplished with only relatively small (<35%) changes in the axial dimension. These experimental results and associated theoretical mechanics models demonstrate the extent to which nanoscale engineering of electrode geometry can be used to advantage in the design of rechargeable batteries with highly reversible capacity and long-term cycle stability."

340,10.1021/NN303145J,2012.0,Photothermally reduced graphene as high-power anodes for lithium-ion batteries.,"Conventional graphitic anodes in lithium-ion batteries cannot provide high-power densities due to slow diffusivity of lithium ions in the bulk electrode material. Here we report photoflash and laser-reduced free-standing graphene paper as high-rate capable anodes for lithium-ion batteries. Photothermal reduction of graphene oxide yields an expanded structure with micrometer-scale pores, cracks, and intersheet voids. This open-pore structure enables access to the underlying sheets of graphene for lithium ions and facilitates efficient intercalation kinetics even at ultrafast charge/discharge rates of >100 C. Importantly, photothermally reduced graphene anodes are structurally robust and display outstanding stability and cycling ability. At charge/discharge rates of ~40 C, photoreduced graphene anodes delivered a steady capacity of ~156 mAh/g(anode) continuously over 1000 charge/discharge cycles, providing a stable power density of ~10 kW/kg(anode). Such electrodes are envisioned to be mass scalable with relatively simple and low-cost fabrication procedures, thereby providing a clear pathway toward commercialization."

Nevertheless, the sluggish sulfur redox and shuttle effect in Li‐S batteries are the major obstacles to their commercial application. Previous investigations on adsorption for LiPSs have made great progress but cannot restrain the shuttle effect. Catalysts can enhance the reaction kinetics, and then alleviate the shuttle effect. The synergistic relationship between adsorption and catalysis has become the hotspot for research into suppressing the shuttle effect and improving battery performance. Herein, the adsorption‐catalysis synergy in Li‐S batteries is reviewed, the adsorption‐catalysis designs are divided into four categories: adsorption‐catalysis for LiPSs aggregation, polythionate or thiosulfate generation, and sulfur radical formation, as well as other adsorption‐catalysis. Then advanced strategies, future perspectives, and challenges are proposed to aim at long‐life and high‐efficiency Li‐S batteries."
342,10.1149/1.1838857,1998.0,Capacity Fade Mechanisms and Side Reactions in Lithium‐Ion Batteries,"The capacity of a lithium-ion battery decreases during cycling. This capacity loss or fade occurs due to several different mechanisms which are due to or are associated with unwanted side reactions that occur in these batteries. These reactions occur during overcharge or overdischarge and cause electrolyte decomposition, passive film formation, active material dissolution, and other phenomena. These capacity loss mechanisms are not included in the present lithium-ion battery mathematical models available in the open literature. Consequently, these models cannot be used to predict cell performance during cycling and under abuse conditions. This article presents a review of the current literature on capacity fade mechanisms and attempts to describe the information needed and the directions that may be taken to include these mechanisms in advanced lithium-ion battery models."

344,10.1021/JA056811Q,2006.0,Rechargeable LI2O2 electrode for lithium batteries.,"Rechargeable lithium batteries represent one of the most important developments in energy storage for 100 years, with the potential to address the key problem of global warming. However, their ability to store energy is limited by the quantity of lithium that may be removed from and reinserted into the positive intercalation electrode, Li(x)CoO(2), 0.5 < x < 1 (corresponding to 140 mA.h g(-1) of charge storage). Abandoning the intercalation electrode and allowing Li to react directly with O(2) from the air at a porous electrode increases the theoretical charge storage by a remarkable 5-10 times! Here we demonstrate two essential prerequisites for the successful operation of a rechargeable Li/O(2) battery; that the Li(2)O(2) formed on discharging such an O(2) electrode is decomposed to Li and O(2) on charging (shown here by in situ mass spectrometry), with or without a catalyst, and that charge/discharge cycling is sustainable for many cycles."

However, unstable solid electrolyte interphase and lithium dendrite growth during lithium plating/stripping induce poor safety, low Coulombic efficiency, and short span life of lithium metal batteries. Lately, varies of micro/nanostructured lithium metal anodes are proposed to address these issues in lithium metal batteries. With the unique surface, pore, and connecting structures of different nanomaterials, lithium plating/stripping processes have been regulated.

347,10.1021/nl302249v,2012.0,Conflicting roles of nickel in controlling cathode performance in lithium ion batteries.,"A variety of approaches are being made to enhance the performance of lithium ion batteries. Incorporating multivalence transition-metal ions into metal oxide cathodes has been identified as an essential approach to achieve the necessary high voltage and high capacity. However, the fundamental mechanism that limits their power rate and cycling stability remains unclear. The power rate strongly depends on the lithium ion drift speed in the cathode. Crystallographically, these transition-metal-based cathodes frequently have a layered structure. In the classic wisdom, it is accepted that lithium ion travels swiftly within the layers moving out/in of the cathode during the charge/discharge. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of a thermodynamically driven, yet kinetically controlled, surface modification in the widely explored lithium nickel manganese oxide cathode material, which may inhibit the battery charge/discharge rate. We found that during cathode synthesis and processing before electrochemical cycling in the cell nickel can preferentially move along the fast diffusion channels and selectively segregate at the surface facets terminated with a mix of anions and cations. This segregation essentially can lead to a higher lithium diffusion barrier near the surface region of the particle. Therefore, it appears that the transition-metal dopant may help to provide high capacity and/or high voltage but can be located in a ""wrong"" location that may slow down lithium diffusion, limiting battery performance. In this circumstance, limitations in the properties of lithium ion batteries using these cathode materials can be determined more by the materials synthesis issues than by the operation within the battery itself."

350,,,Lithium-assisted Plastic Deformation of Silicon Electrodes in Lithium-ion Batteries: a First-principles Theoretical Study,"E nergy storage is a crucial aspect of integrating renewable energy sources in power grids, making the development of efficient high-capacity batteries an important technological challenge. 1 For applications that are especially sensitive to weight and size, such as portable electronics and electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries are the current industry standard. 2 Each electrode in a lithium-ion battery is a host of lithium. During cycles of charge and discharge, lithium diffuses into or out of the electrode, inducing a mechanical deformation and a field of stress in the host frame. In practice, the stress often causes the electrode to fracture or to change its morphology. 3À9 Loss of structural integrity typically reduces the electrical conductance, leading to a steady fading of the capacity during chargeÀdischarge cycles. Mechanical stability is one of the key criteria for the selection of materials for commercial batteries. 12 The electrode material has to maintain its mechanical integrity and chemical properties over a long lifetime. Lithiation-induced fracture not only limits the lifetime of existing commercial batteries but also acts as a bottleneck for developing high-capacity lithium-ion batteries. 13 For example, the extremely high capacity of silicon, which can host up to 4.4 Li atoms per Si atom, has motivated intense research, 14 but the large amount of absorbed Li results in volume swelling of ∼400%, which pulverizes the electrodes. One way to circumvent this mechanical damage is the use of nanostructures, possibly encapsulated by confining oxide layers, which can mitigate the effects of stress by managing the electrode deformation pattern through its shape and geometric restrictions. 15À17 Recent experiments indicate that the lithiation-induced large deformation of silicon electrodes can be accommodated by plastic flow: during lithiation silicon films deform plastically when the stress exceeds a yield strength. 18 This feature makes it possible to maintain good capacity over many cycles for silicon anodes of small sizes, such as thin films, 19 nanowires, 6 and porous structures. 20 For instance, Takamura et al. 19 have demonstrated fracture-free lithiation of a 50 nm thick silicon film for more than 1000 cycles. During this cycling, the film develops surface undulations, a type of roughening also observed during cyclic lithiation of silicon nanowires. 6 Furthermore, Sethuraman et al. 18 measured lithiation-induced stress as a function of the state of charge in an amorphous silicon thin film and found a pronounced hysteresis, indicating plastic deformation of lithiated silicon. These observations motivated …"

Here, we visualize lithium growth in a glass capillary cell and demonstrate a change of mechanism from root-growing mossy lithium to tip-growing dendritic lithium at the onset of electrolyte diffusion limitation. In sandwich cells, we further demonstrate that mossy lithium can be blocked by nanoporous ceramic separators, while dendritic lithium can easily penetrate nanopores and short the cell. Our results imply a fundamental design constraint for metal batteries (“Sand's capacity”), which can be increased by using concentrated electrolytes with stiff, permeable, nanoporous separators for improved safety."

It was studied as a cathode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) using 0.5 mol l−1Li2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Charge and discharge capacities at a current density of 10 A g−1 (about 90C) were 76% and 95% of the total capacity (118 mAh g−1), respectively. The power density can be up to 10000 W kg−1 and the cycling behavior is excellent. After 10000 cycles at 9C with 100% DOD (depth of discharge), the capacity retention of porous LiMn2O4 is 93%, which indicates that it can be used for a lifetime without maintenance. The main reasons for its excellent electrochemical performance are due to the nano grains, porous morphology and high crystalline structure. In addition, the acid-free aqueous electrolyte prevents Mn2+ from dissolution. These excellent results suggest a great promise for the development of aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) in practical application."

360,10.1021/ja2018543,2011.0,Structure and lithium transport pathways in Li2FeSiO4 cathodes for lithium batteries.,"The importance of exploring new low-cost and safe cathodes for large-scale lithium batteries has led to increasing interest in Li(2)FeSiO(4). The structure of Li(2)FeSiO(4) undergoes significant change on cycling, from the as-prepared γ(s) form to an inverse β(II) polymorph; therefore it is important to establish the structure of the cycled material. In γ(s) half the LiO(4), FeO(4), and SiO(4) tetrahedra point in opposite directions in an ordered manner and exhibit extensive edge sharing. Transformation to the inverse β(II) polymorph on cycling involves inversion of half the SiO(4), FeO(4), and LiO(4) tetrahedra, such that they all now point in the same direction, eliminating edge sharing between cation sites and flattening the oxygen layers. As a result of the structural changes, Li(+) transport paths and corresponding Li-Li separations in the cycled structure are quite different from the as-prepared material, as revealed here by computer modeling, and involve distinct zigzag paths between both Li sites and through intervening unoccupied octahedral sites that share faces with the LiO(4) tetrahedra."

Molybdenum disulfide is a highly promising material for LIBs that compensates for its intermediate insertion voltage (∼2 V vs. Li/Li+) with a high reversible capacity (up to 1290 mA h g−1) and an excellent rate capability (e.g. 554 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at 50 C). Several themes emerge when surveying the scientific literature on the subject: first, we argue that there is excellent data to show that truly nanoscale structures, which often contain a nanodispersed carbon phase, consistently possess superior charge storage capacity and cycling performance. We provide several hypotheses regarding why the measured capacities in such architectures are well above the theoretical predictions of the known MoS2 intercalation and conversion reactions. Second, we highlight the growing microstructural and electrochemical evidence that the layered MoS2 structure does not survive past the initial lithiation cycle, and that subsequently the electrochemically active material is actually elemental sulfur. Third, we show that certain synthesis techniques are consistently demonstrated to be the most promising for battery applications, and describe these in detail. Fourth, we present our selection of synthesis methods that we believe to have a high potential for creating improved MoS2 LIB electrodes, but are yet to be tried."

A transparent life cycle inventory (LCI) was compiled in a component-wise manner for nickel metal hydride (NiMH), nickel cobalt manganese lithium-ion (NCM), and iron phosphate lithium-ion (LFP) batteries. The battery systems were investigated with a functional unit based on energy storage, and environmental impacts were analyzed using midpoint indicators. On a per-storage basis, the NiMH technology was found to have the highest environmental impact, followed by NCM and then LFP, for all categories considered except ozone depletion potential. We found higher life cycle global warming emissions than have been previously reported. Detailed contribution and structural path analyses allowed for the identification of the different processes and value-chains most directly responsible for these emissions.

369,10.1149/2.0321602JES,2016.0,Optimizing areal capacities through understanding the limitations of lithium-ion electrodes,"Increasing the areal capacity or electrode thickness in lithium ion batteries is one possible means to increase pack level energy density while simultaneously lowering cost. The physics that limit use of high areal capacity as a function of battery power to energy ratio are poorly understood and thus most currently produced automotive lithium ion cells utilize modest loadings to ensure long life over the vehicle battery operation. Here we show electrolyte transport limits the utilization of the positive electrode at critical C-rates during discharge; whereas, a combination of electrolyte transport and polarization lead to lithium plating in the graphite electrode during charge. Experimental measurements are compared with theoretical predictions based on concentrated solution and porous electrode theories. An analytical expression is derived to provide design criteria for long lived operation based on the physical properties of the electrode and electrolyte. Finally, a guideline is proposed that graphite cells should avoid charge current densities near or above 4 mA/cm2 unless additional precautions have been made to avoid deleterious side reaction."

By weight, this is roughly 10 times higher than conventional lithium-ion batteries and would be sufficient to power cars with a range comparable to those with gasoline engines. But engineering a Li-air battery has been a challenge. Liu et al. managed to overcome the remaining challenges: They were able to avoid electrode passivation, turn limited solvent stability into an advantage, eliminate the fatal problems caused by superoxides, achieve high power with negligible degradation, and even circumvent the problems of removing atmospheric water. Science, this issue p. 530 An efficient, high-capacity, safe Li-air battery system is realized. The rechargeable aprotic lithium-air (Li-O2) battery is a promising potential technology for next-generation energy storage, but its practical realization still faces many challenges. In contrast to the standard Li-O2 cells, which cycle via the formation of Li2O2, we used a reduced graphene oxide electrode, the additive LiI, and the solvent dimethoxyethane to reversibly form and remove crystalline LiOH with particle sizes larger than 15 micrometers during discharge and charge. This leads to high specific capacities, excellent energy efficiency (93.2%) with a voltage gap of only 0.2 volt, and impressive rechargeability. The cells tolerate high concentrations of water, water being the dominant proton source for the LiOH; together with LiI, it has a decisive impact on the chemical nature of the discharge product and on battery performance."

A novel functional carbon composite (carbon-nanotube-interpenetrated mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon spheres, MNCS/CNT), which can strongly adsorb lithium polysulfides, is now reported to act as a sulfur host. The nitrogen functional groups of this composite enable the effective trapping of lithium polysulfides on electroactive sites within the cathode, leading to a much improved electrochemical performance (1200 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles). The enhancement in adsorption can be attributed to the chemical bonding of lithium ions by nitrogen functional groups in the MNCS/CNT framework. Furthermore, the micrometer-sized spherical structure of the material yields a high areal capacity (ca. 6 mAh cm(-2)) with a high sulfur loading of approximately 5 mg cm(-2), which is ideal for practical applications of the lithium-sulfur batteries."

The remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and state of health (SOH) monitoring are two important parts in PHM of the lithium-ion battery. Nowadays, the development of signal processing technology and neural network technology introduces new data-driven methods to RUL prediction and SOH monitoring of the lithium-ion battery. This paper presents a neural-network-based method that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) network with particle swarm optimization and attention mechanism for RUL prediction and SOH monitoring of the lithium-ion battery. Before predicting RUL of the lithium-ion battery, the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) is utilized for the raw data denoising, which can improve the accuracy of prediction. A real-life cycle dataset of lithium-ion batteries from NASA is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the experiment results show that when compared with traditional methods, the proposed method has higher accuracy."

The effects of seven different liquid electrolytes on the electrochemical performance were investigated using galvanostatic discharge–charge tests on coin cells. The electrolytes included ether, sulfone, and carbonate solvents with common lithium salts. It was found that the solvent plays a key role on the electrochemical performance of the lithium/sulfur battery cathode while the lithium salt has no significant effects. Additional characterization, using in situ sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), provided insights into the soluble sulfur species in the discharged and charged batteries. We find that the use of low-viscosity ethereal solvents results in a more complete reduction of soluble polysulfides, while soluble polysulfides remained more oxidized in viscous ethereal solvents. Moreover, XAS revealed that reduced sulfur species chemically react with carbonate-based solvents, making this class..."

376,10.1126/science.aas9343,2018.0,A high-energy-density lithium-oxygen battery based on a reversible four-electron conversion to lithium oxide,"An elevated lithium battery Batteries based on lithium metal and oxygen could offer energy densities an order of magnitude larger than that of lithium ion cells. But, under normal operation conditions, the lithium oxidizes to form peroxide or superoxide. Xia et al. show that, at increased temperatures, the formation of lithium oxide is favored, through a process in which four electrons are transferred for each oxygen molecule (see the Perspective by Feng et al.). Reversible cycling is achieved through the use of a thermally stable inorganic electrolyte and a bifunctional catalyst for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Science, this issue p. 777; see also p. 758 At elevated temperatures, lithium can reversibly cycle to form dilithium oxide through a four-electron transfer process. Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries have attracted much attention owing to the high theoretical energy density afforded by the two-electron reduction of O2 to lithium peroxide (Li2O2). We report an inorganic-electrolyte Li-O2 cell that cycles at an elevated temperature via highly reversible four-electron redox to form crystalline lithium oxide (Li2O). It relies on a bifunctional metal oxide host that catalyzes O–O bond cleavage on discharge, yielding a high capacity of 11 milliampere-hours per square centimeter, and O2 evolution on charge with very low overpotential. Online mass spectrometry and chemical quantification confirm that oxidation of Li2O involves transfer of exactly 4 e–/O2. This work shows that Li-O2 electrochemistry is not intrinsically limited once problems of electrolyte, superoxide, and cathode host are overcome and that coulombic efficiency close to 100% can be achieved."

Owing to the rapid development of such equipment there is an increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries with high energy density and long cycle life. For high energy density, the electrode materials in the lithium-ion batteries must possess high specific storage capacity and coulombic efficiency. Graphite and LiCoO2 are normally used and have high coulombic efficiencies (typically >90%) but rather low capacities (372 and 145 mAhg, respectively).[1–5] Various anode materials with improved storage capacity and thermal stability have been proposed for lithium-ion batteries in the last decade. Among these, silicon has attracted great interest as a candidate to replace commercial graphite materials owing to its numerous appealing features: it has the highest theoretical capacity (Li4.4Sio4200 mAhg) of all known materials, and is abundant, inexpensive, and safer than graphite (it shows a slightly higher voltage plateau than that of graphite as shown in Figure S1, and lithiated silicon is more stable in typical electrolytes than lithiated graphite[6])."

Unfortunately, the unstable interface between lithium and nonaqueous electrolyte induces dendritic Li and low Coulombic efficiency during repeated Li plating/stripping, which is one of the huge obstacles toward practical lithium‐metal batteries. Here, a composite mixed ionic/electronic conductor interphase (MCI) is formed on the surface of Li by in situ chemical reactions of a copper‐fluoride‐based solution and Li metal at room temperature. The as‐obtained MCI film acts like the armor of a soldier to protect the Li‐metal anode by its prioritized lithium storage, high ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus. The armored MCI can effectively suppress Li‐dendrite growth and work effectively in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2/Li cells. The armored MCI presents fresh insights into the formation and regulation of the stable electrode–electrolyte interface and an effective strategy to protect Li‐metal anodes in working Li‐metal batteries."

Mesoporous NiO particles were characterized by small angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results demonstrated that the as-prepared mesoporous NiO had an ordered Ia3d symmetric mesostructure, with a high surface area of 96 m2/g. Mesoporous NiO materials were tested as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, exhibiting much lower activation energy (20.75 kJ mol−1) compared to the bulk NiO (45.02 kJ mol−1). We found that the mesoporous NiO electrode has higher lithium intercalation kinetics than its bulk counterpart. The specific capacity of mesoporous NiO after 50 cycles was maintained 680 mAh/g at 0.1 C, which was much higher than that of the commercial bulk NiO (188 mAh/g). Furthermore, at a high rate of 2C, the discharge capacity of mesoporous NiO was as high as 515 mAh/g, demonstrating the potential to be used for high power lithium ion batteries."

To make a full battery out of them, either the cathode or the anode needs to be prelithiated. Here, we present a method for prelithiating a silicon nanowire (SiNW) anode by a facile self-discharge mechanism. Through a time dependence study, we found that 20 min of prelithiation loads ∼50% of the full capacity into the SiNWs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies show that the nanostructure of SiNWs is maintained after prelithiation. We constructed a full battery using our prelithiated SiNW anode with a sulfur cathode. Our work provides a protocol for pairing lithium-free electrodes to make the next-generation high-energy LIB."

However, conventional binders have intrinsic drawbacks such as poor capability of absorbing hydrophilic lithium polysulfides, resulting in severe capacity decay. This study reports a new type of binder by polymerization of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether with polyethylenimine, which enables strongly anchoring polysulfides for high‐performance lithium sulfur batteries, demonstrating remarkable improvement in both mechanical performance for standing up to 100 g weight and an excellent capacity retention of 72% over 400 cycles at 1.5 C. Importantly, in situ micro‐Raman investigation verifies the effectively reduced polysulfides shuttling from sulfur cathode to lithium anode, which shows the greatly suppressed shuttle effect by the polar‐functional binder. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis into the discharge intermediates upon battery cycling reveals that the hydrophilic binder endows the sulfur electrodes with multidimensional Li‐O, Li‐N, and S‐O interactions with sulfur species to effectively mitigate lithium polysulfide dissolution, which is theoretically confirmed by density‐functional theory calculations."

Here we show that this limitation can be circumvented by using co-intercalation phenomena in a diglyme-based electrolyte. The resulting compound is a stage-I ternary intercalation compound with an estimated stoichiometry of Na(diglyme)2C20. Highlights of the electrode reaction are its high energy efficiency, the small irreversible loss during the first cycle, and a superior cycle life with capacities close to 100 mAh g(-1) for 1000 cycles and coulomb efficiencies >99.87%.

The capacity fade and resistance deterioration were estimated by the dual-sliding-mode observer. The dual-sliding-mode observer consists of a fast-paced time-varying observer and a slow-paced time-varying observer. The fast-paced time-varying observer estimates parameters, such as the state of charge and terminal voltage, and polarization effects. The slow-paced time-varying observer estimates the SOH in terms of the capacity fade and resistance deterioration. The convergence of the proposed observer was proved by the Lyapunov equation.

391,10.1039/C1JM10213C,2011.0,The failure mechanism of nano-sized Si-based negative electrodes for lithium ion batteries,"Understanding the failure mechanism of silicon based negative electrodes for lithium ion batteries is essential for solving the problem of low coulombic efficiency and capacity fading on cycling and to further implement this new very energetic material in commercial cells. To reach this goal, several techniques are used here: post mortem7Li MAS NMR and SEM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and three-electrode-based electrochemical analysis. 7Li MAS NMR analyses of the charged batteries demonstrate that the major part of the lithium lost during the charge of batteries is not trapped in LixSi alloys but instead at the surface of the Si particles, likely as a degradation product of the liquid electrolyte. Observed by SEM, a dead electrode has a thick “SEI” layer at its surface. EIS and incremental capacity analyses demonstrate that the growth of this layer is responsible for the failure of the electrode through a continuous decrease of its active surface area associated with a rise of the electrode polarization. It is demonstrated that the main cause of capacity fade of Si-based negative electrodes is the liquid electrolyte degradation in the case of nano Si-particles formulated with the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder. This degradation results in the formation of a blocking layer on the active mass, which further inhibits lithium diffusion through the composite electrode."

However, even though there are worldwide demonstration projects, where energy storage systems based on Lithium-ion batteries are evaluated for such applications, the field experience is still very limited. In consequence, at present, there are no very clear requirements on how the Lithium-ion battery energy storage systems should be operated, while providing frequency regulation service and how the system has to reestablish its state of charge (SOC) once the frequency event has passed. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effect on the lifetime of the Lithium-ion batteries energy storage system of various strategies for reestablishing the batteries’ SOC after the primary frequency regulation is successfully delivered."

For each material we consider the insertion of both one and two lithium ions per redox-active metal, calculating average voltages and stability relative to a database of nearly 100,000 previously calculated compounds. To evaluate lithium mobility, we calculate the activation energies for lithium diffusion through the known tavorite cathode materials LiVO(PO4), LiV(PO4)F, and LiFe(SO4)F. Our calculations indicate that tavorite-structured materials are capable of very high rates of one-dimensional lithium diffusion, and several tavorite-structured materials may be capable of reversibly inserting two lithium ions per redox-active..."

Among the various existing energy storage technologies, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are considered as effective solution to the increasing need for high-energy electrochemical power sources. This review addresses using electrospinning technology to develop novel composite nanofibers which can be used as anodes, cathodes, and separators for lithium-ion batteries. The discussion focuses on the preparation, structure, and performance of silicon/carbon (Si/C) nanofiber anodes, lithium iron phosphate/carbon (LiFePO4/C) nanofiber cathodes, and lithium lanthanum titanate oxide/polyacrylonitrile (LLTO/PAN) nanofiber separators. Si/C nanofiber anodes have the advantages of both carbon (long cycle life) and Si (high lithium-storage capacity). LiFePO4/C nanofiber cathodes show good electrochemical performance including satisfactory capacity and good cycling stability. LLTO/PAN nanofiber separators have large electrolyte uptake, high ionic conductivity, and low interfacial resistance with lithium, which increase the capacity and improve the cycling stability of lithium-ion cells. These results demonstrate that electrospinning is a promising approach to prepare high-performance nanofiber anodes, nanofiber cathodes, and nanofiber separators that can potentially replace currently-used lithium-ion battery materials."
397,10.1002/adfm.201808756,2019.0,Lithium–Magnesium Alloy as a Stable Anode for Lithium–Sulfur Battery,"Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as the promising next‐generation energy storage device due to the high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the practical application of Li–S batteries is still limited owing to the cycle stability of both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode. In particular, the instability in the bulk and at the surface of the lithium anode during cycling becomes a huge obstacle for the practical application of Li–S battery. Herein, a Li‐rich lithium–magnesium (Li–Mg) alloy is investigated as an anode for Li–S batteries, based on the consideration of improving the stability in the bulk and at the surface of the lithium anode. Our experimental results reveal that the robust passivation layer is formed on the surface of the Li–Mg alloy anode, which is helpful to reduce side reactions, and enable the smooth surface morphology of anode during cycling. Meanwhile, the mixed electron and Li‐ion conducting matrix of the Li‐poor Li–Mg alloy as a porous skeleton structure can also be formed after delithiation, which can guarantee the structural integrity of the anode in the bulk during Li stripping/plating process. Therefore, the Li‐rich Li–Mg alloy is demonstrated to be a very promising anode material for Li–S battery."

In this paper, an earlier thermal runaway of cells after fast charging applies is illustrated. Under this condition, the reaction between the plated lithium and electrolyte is revealed to be the mechanism of thermal runaway triggering. The mechanism is proved by the accelerated rate calorimetry tests for partial cells, which determine the triggering reactions of thermal runaway in the anode-electrolyte thermodynamic system. The reactants in this system is analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimetry, proving that the vigorous exothermic reaction is induced by the interaction between the plated lithium and electrolyte. As a result, the finding of thermal runaway triggered by the plated lithium on anode surface of cells after fast charging promotes the understanding of thermal runaway mechanisms, which warns us the danger of the plated lithium in the utilization of lithium-ion batteries."

400,10.1021/ja312241y,2013.0,Dendrite-free lithium deposition via self-healing electrostatic shield mechanism.,"Rechargeable lithium metal batteries are considered the ""Holy Grail"" of energy storage systems. Unfortunately, uncontrollable dendritic lithium growth inherent in these batteries (upon repeated charge/discharge cycling) has prevented their practical application over the past 40 years. We show a novel mechanism that can fundamentally alter dendrite formation. At low concentrations, selected cations (such as cesium or rubidium ions) exhibit an effective reduction potential below the standard reduction potential of lithium ions. During lithium deposition, these additive cations form a positively charged electrostatic shield around the initial growth tip of the protuberances without reduction and deposition of the additives. This forces further deposition of lithium to adjacent regions of the anode and eliminates dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries. This strategy may also prevent dendrite growth in lithium-ion batteries as well as other metal batteries and transform the surface uniformity of coatings deposited in many general electrodeposition processes."

403,10.1073/pnas.1619489114,2017.0,Three-dimensional stable lithium metal anode with nanoscale lithium islands embedded in ionically conductive solid matrix,"Significance Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next-generation high-energy lithium battery systems. This work introduces an electrolyte-proof design of three-dimensional lithium metal anode where most of the lithium domains are embedded in a lithium-ion conductive matrix. In this architecture, the lithium-ion conductive matrix can isolate the embedded lithium domains from liquid electrolyte and thus prevent severe initial side reactions, while the matrix can simultaneously transport lithium ion and maintain the electrochemical activity of the embedded lithium. The design principle enables highly stable, high-power, and safe lithium metal anodes with minimal side reactions and negligible volume variation during cycling, which paves the way for viable lithium metal batteries in the future. Rechargeable batteries based on lithium (Li) metal chemistry are attractive for next-generation electrochemical energy storage. Nevertheless, excessive dendrite growth, infinite relative dimension change, severe side reactions, and limited power output severely impede their practical applications. Although exciting progress has been made to solve parts of the above issues, a versatile solution is still absent. Here, a Li-ion conductive framework was developed as a stable “host” and efficient surface protection to address the multifaceted problems, which is a significant step forward compared with previous host concepts. This was fulfilled by reacting overstoichiometry of Li with SiO. The as-formed LixSi–Li2O matrix would not only enable constant electrode-level volume, but also protect the embedded Li from direct exposure to electrolyte. Because uniform Li nucleation and deposition can be fulfilled owing to the high-density active Li domains, the as-obtained nanocomposite electrode exhibits low polarization, stable cycling, and high-power output (up to 10 mA/cm2) even in carbonate electrolytes. The Li–S prototype cells further exhibited highly improved capacity retention under high-power operation (∼600 mAh/g at 6.69 mA/cm2). The all-around improvement on electrochemical performance sheds light on the effectiveness of the design principle for developing safe and stable Li metal anodes."

In this paper, we developed a versatile route to synthesize hollow TiO2/graphitic carbon (H-TiO2/GC) spheres with superior electrochemical performance. The as-prepared mesoporous H-TiO2/GC hollow spheres present a high specific surface area (298 m(2) g(-1)), a high pore volume (0.31 cm(3) g(-1)), a large pore size (∼5 nm), well-defined hollow structure (monodispersed size of 600 nm and inner diameter of ∼400 nm, shell thickness of 100 nm), and small nanocrystals of anatase TiO2 (∼8 nm) conformably encapsulated in ultrathin graphitic carbon layers.

Herein, we developed a type of free-standing poly(propylene carbonate)/Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 composite solid electrolyte for ambient temperature and flexible solid-state lithium batteries. The composite solid electrolyte exhibited excellent comprehensive performance in terms of high ionic conductivity (5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 20 °C, a wide electrochemical window (4.6 V), high ionic transference number (0.75) and satisfactory mechanical strength (6.8 MPa). When evaluated as solid electrolyte for an ambient-temperature solid lithium battery, such a composite electrolyte delivered excellent rate capability (5C) at 20 °C. This superior performance can be comparable to a liquid electrolyte-soaked PP separator-based lithium battery at room temperature. To our knowledge, this is the best rate capability of a solid composite electrolyte for a solid lithium battery at ambient temperature. Moreover, such a composite electrolyte-based flexible LiFePO4/Li4Ti5O12 lithium ion battery delivered excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability. All these fascinating features make poly(propylene carbonate)/Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 a very promising all-solid-state electrolyte for flexible solid lithium batteries. Our study makes a big step into addressing the challenges of ambient-temperature solid lithium batteries."
408,10.1021/ja905488x,2010.0,Influence of size on the rate of mesoporous electrodes for lithium batteries.,"High power rechargeable lithium batteries are a key target for transport and load leveling, in order to mitigate CO(2) emissions. It has already been demonstrated that mesoporous lithium intercalation compounds (composed of particles containing nanometer diameter pores separated by walls of similar size) can deliver high rate (power) and high stability on cycling. Here we investigate how the critical dimensions of pore size and wall thickness control the rate of intercalation (electrode reaction). By using mesoporous beta-MnO(2), the influence of these mesodimensions on lithium intercalation via single and two-phase intercalation processes has been studied in the same material enabling direct comparison. Pore size and wall thickness both influence the rate of single and two-phase intercalation mechanisms, but the latter is more sensitive than the former."

On the other hand, safety issues and poor cyclability strongly limit practical application. Solid‐state electrolytes (SSEs) can present as high ionic conductivity as aprotic electrolytes and eventually avoid the shuttle effect, which provides an ultimate solution for safe Li–S batteries with good cyclability. In this review, the recent achievements in all‐solid‐state Li–S batteries based on inorganic SSEs are summarized. Furthermore, the main attentions are paid to the interfaces, including metallic lithium|SSEs, SSEs|SSEs, and composite sulfur cathode|SSEs. The potential approaches to deal with these interfacial issues are proposed as well, such as composite SSEs with an asymmetric structure to enhance their compatibility with lithium anodes and sulfur cathodes, adding Li2O or LiF and increasing the densification to reduce the grain boundary resistance, and nanomaterials used to improve the kinetic process in cathode."
410,10.1021/nl103343w,2010.0,Electrospun ultralong hierarchical vanadium oxide nanowires with high performance for lithium ion batteries.,"Ultralong hierarchical vanadium oxide nanowires with diameter of 100-200 nm and length up to several millimeters were synthesized using the low-cost starting materials by electrospinning combined with annealing. The hierarchical nanowires were constructed from attached vanadium oxide nanorods of diameter around 50 nm and length of 100 nm. The initial and 50th discharge capacities of the ultralong hierarchical vanadium oxide nanowire cathodes are up to 390 and 201 mAh/g when the lithium ion battery cycled between 1.75 and 4.0 V. When the battery was cycled between 2.0 and 4.0 V, the initial and 50th discharge capacities of the nanowire cathodes are 275 and 187 mAh/g. Compared with self-aggregated short nanorods synthesized by hydrothermal method, the ultralong hierarchical vanadium oxide nanowires exhibit much higher capacity. This is due to the fact that self-aggregation of the unique nanorod-in-nanowire structures have been greatly reduced because of the attachment of nanorods in the ultralong nanowires, which can keep the effective contact areas of active materials, conductive additives, and electrolyte large and fully realize the advantage of nanomaterial-based cathodes. This demonstrates that ultralong hierarchical vanadium oxide nanowire is one of the most favorable nanostructures as cathodes for improving cycling performance of lithium ion batteries."

Two major strategies for the application of ion conducting polymers as separators in lithium batteries are identified: One is the development of highly conductive materials via the crosslinking of mobile chains to form networks, which are then swollen by lithium salt solutions (""gel electrolytes""). The other is the construction of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with supramolecular architectures, which intrinsically give rise to much enhanced mechanical strength. These materials as yet exhibit relatively common conductivity levels but may be applied as very thin films. Molecular composites based on poly(p-phenylene)- (PPP)-reinforced SPEs are a striking example of this direction. Neither strategy has as yet led to a ""breakthrough"" with respect to technical application, at least not for electrically powered vehicles. Before being used as separators, the gel electrolytes must be strengthened, while the molecularly reinforced solid polymer electrolytes must demonstrate improved conductivity."

Efficient electrochemical energy storage devices play a crucial role in storing harvested energies in our daily lives. For example, rechargeable batteries can store energy generated by solar cells during the daytime and release it during night-time. In particular, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have received considerable attention ever since their early commercialization in 1990s. However, with initiatives by several governments to build large-scale energy grids to store energy for cities, problems such as the high cost and limited availability of lithium starts to become major issues. Sodium, which also belongs to Group 1 of the periodic table, has comparable electrochemical properties to Lithium, and more importantly it is considerably more accessible than lithium. Nonetheless, research into sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) is currently still in its infancy compared to LIBs, although great leaps and bounds have been made recently in terms of research and development into this technology.

421,10.1126/science.1171541,2009.0,Fabricating Genetically Engineered High-Power Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Multiple Virus Genes,"Viral Battery In developing materials for batteries, there is a trade-off between charge capacity, conductivity, and chemical stability. Nanostructured materials improve the conductivity for some resistive materials, but fabricating stable materials at nanometer-length scales is difficult. Harnessing their knowledge of viruses as toolkits for materials fabrication, Lee et al. (p. 1051; published online 2 April) modified two genes in the filamentous bacteriophage M13 to produce a virus with an affinity for nucleating amorphous iron phosphate along its length and for attaching carbon nanotubes at one of the ends. In nanostructured form, the amorphous iron phosphate produced a useful cathode material, while the carbon nanotubes formed a percolating network that significantly enhanced conductivity. A genetically modified virus is used to form an efficient cathodic battery material. Development of materials that deliver more energy at high rates is important for high-power applications, including portable electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles. For lithium-ion (Li+) batteries, reducing material dimensions can boost Li+ ion and electron transfer in nanostructured electrodes. By manipulating two genes, we equipped viruses with peptide groups having affinity for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) on one end and peptides capable of nucleating amorphous iron phosphate(a-FePO4) fused to the viral major coat protein. The virus clone with the greatest affinity toward SWNTs enabled power performance of a-FePO4 comparable to that of crystalline lithium iron phosphate (c-LiFePO4) and showed excellent capacity retention upon cycling at 1C. This environmentally benign low-temperature biological scaffold could facilitate fabrication of electrodes from materials previously excluded because of extremely low electronic conductivity."

A universal strategy of hindering formation of lithium dendrites via tuning surface energy of the relevant thin film growth is suggested. The merit of the novel motif lies not only fundamentally a perfect correlation between electrochemistry and thin film fields, but also significantly promotes larger‐scale application of lithium–sulfur and lithium–air batteries, as well as other metal batteries (e.g., Zn, Na, K, Cu, Ag, and Sn)."

424,10.1002/ANIE.200603309,2007.0,Preparation and electrochemical properties of SnO2 nanowires for application in lithium-ion batteries.,"One-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials have received considerable attention for advanced functional systems as well as extensive applications owing to their attractive electronic, optical, and thermal properties. In lithium-ion-battery science, recent research has focused on nanoscale electrode materials to improve electrochemical performance. The high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent surface activities of 1D nanostructured materials have stimulated great interest in their development for the next generation of power sources. Materials based on tin oxide have been proposed as alternative anode materials with high-energy densities and stable capacity retention in lithium-ion batteries. Various SnO2-based materials have displayed extraordinary electrochemical behavior such that the initial irreversible capacity induced by Li2O formation and the abrupt capacity fading caused by volume variation could be effectively reduced when in nanoscale form. From this point of view, SnO2 nanowires can also be suggested as a promising anode material because the nanowire structure is of special interest with predictions of unique electronic and structural properties. Furthermore, the nanowires can be easily synthesized by a thermal evaporation method. However, in its current form, this method of manufacture of SnO2 nanowires has several limitations: it is inappropriate for mass production as high synthesis temperatures are required and there are difficulties in the elimination of metal catalysts that could act as impurities or defects. This results in reversible capacity loss or poor cyclic performance during electrochemical reactions. 12] The critical issues relating to SnO2 nanowires as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries are how to avoid the deteriorative effects of catalysts and how to increase production. Herein, we report on the preparation and electrochemical performance of self-catalysis-grown SnO2 nanowires to determine their potential use as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. SnO2 nanowires have been synthesized by thermal evaporation combined with a self-catalyzed growth procedure by using a ball-milled evaporation material to increase production at lower temperature and prevent the undesirable effects of conventional catalysts on electrochemical performance. The self-catalysis-grown SnO2 nanowires show higher initial coulombic efficiency and an improved cyclic retention compared with those of SnO2 powder and SnO2 nanowires produced by Au-assisted growth. The self-catalysis growth method, which uses a ball-milled mixture of SnO and Sn powder as an evaporation source, is appropriate for obtaining SnO2 nanowires with high purity. The deposited products on the Si substrates contain almost 100% of the SnO2 nanowires formed. Observation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) clearly shows a general view of randomly aligned SnO2 nanowires with diameters of 200–500 nm and lengths extending to several tens of micrometers (Figure 1a). Sn droplets at the tips of nanowires were observed and confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)"
425,10.1063/1.3492617,2010.0,Fracture of electrodes in lithium-ion batteries caused by fast charging,"During charging or discharging of a lithium-ion battery, lithium is extracted from one electrode and inserted into the other. This extraction-insertion reaction causes the electrodes to deform. An electrode is often composed of small active particles in a matrix. If the battery is charged at a rate faster than lithium can homogenize in an active particle by diffusion, the inhomogeneous distribution of lithium results in stresses that may cause the particle to fracture. The distributions of lithium and stress in a LiCoO2 particle are calculated. The energy release rates are then calculated for the particle containing preexisting cracks. These calculations predict the critical rate of charging and size of the particle, below which fracture is averted."

Lithium resources are confirmed to be unevenly distributed in South America, and the cost of the lithium raw materials has roughly doubled from the first practical application in 1991 to the present and is increasing due to global demand for lithium‐ion accumulators. Since the electrochemical equivalent and standard potential of sodium are the most advantageous after lithium, sodium based energy storage is of great interest to realize lithium‐free high energy and high voltage batteries. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no successful reports on electrochemical sodium insertion materials for battery applications; the major challenge is the negative electrode and its passivation. In this study, we achieve high capacity and excellent reversibility sodium‐insertion performance of hard‐carbon and layered NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrodes in propylene carbonate electrolyte solutions. The structural change and passivation for hard‐carbon are investigated to study the reversible sodium insertion. The 3‐volt secondary Na‐ion battery possessing environmental and cost friendliness, Na+‐shuttlecock hard‐carbon/NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cell, demonstrates steady cycling performance as next generation secondary batteries and an alternative to Li‐ion batteries."
427,10.1039/c4cp05865h,2015.0,Electrochemical in situ investigations of SEI and dendrite formation on the lithium metal anode.,"This comparative work studies the self-enforcing heterogeneity of lithium deposition and dissolution as the cause for dendrite formation on the lithium metal anode in various liquid organic solvent based electrolytes. In addition, the ongoing lithium corrosion, its rate and thus the passivating quality of the SEI are investigated in self-discharge measurements. The behavior of the lithium anode is characterized in two carbonate-based standard electrolytes, 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC (3 : 7) and 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1 : 1), and in two alternative electrolytes 1 M LiPF6 in TEGDME and 1 M LiTFSI in DMSO, which have been proposed in the literature as promising electrolytes for lithium metal batteries, more specifically for lithium/air batteries. As a result, electrolyte decomposition, SEI and dendrite formation at the lithium electrode as well as their mutual influences are understood in the development of overpotentials, surface resistances and lithium electrode surface morphologies in subsequent lithium deposition and dissolution processes. A general model of different stages of these processes could be elaborated."
428,10.1021/nl5046318,2015.0,Polymer nanofiber-guided uniform lithium deposition for battery electrodes.,"Lithium metal is one of the most promising candidates as an anode material for next-generation energy storage systems due to its highest specific capacity (3860 mAh/g) and lowest redox potential of all. The uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth that causes a poor cycling performance and serious safety hazards, however, presents a significant challenge for the realization of lithium metal-based batteries. Here, we demonstrate a novel electrode design by placing a three-dimensional (3D) oxidized polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network on top of the current collector. The polymer fiber with polar surface functional groups could guide the lithium ions to form uniform lithium metal deposits confined on the polymer fiber surface and in the 3D polymer layer. We showed stable cycling of lithium metal anode with an average Coulombic efficiency of 97.4% over 120 cycles in ether-based electrolyte at a current density of 3 mA/cm(2) for a total of 1 mAh/cm(2) of lithium."

The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were dispersed on graphene sheets. As anode materials for lithium ion batteries, they showed high reversible capacities, as well as significantly enhanced cycling performances (about 650 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles) and high rate capabilities (350 mA h g−1 at 5 C). The enhancement could be attributed to graphene sheets, which served as electron conductors and buffers. Our results opened a new doorway for the application of graphene sheets to prepare anode materials of lithium ion batteries with superior performances."

The widespread availability of reliable energy storage systems and highly efficient lithium batteries can, in principle, meet this need. For example, many individuals already own at least one lithium-ion battery portable device, such as a cellular phone, MP3 player, digital camera, or laptop computer. Hybrid electric vehicles and full electric vehicles will sooner or later be marketed with lithium-ion batteries. However, to acquire an established role in the commercial sector, lithium-ion batteries must be improved with regard to energy density, cost, and particularly, safety. Further development of electrode materials, especially the cathode active materials, is important to satisfy the above requirements. The easiest route to cathode improvement is to modify the cathode surface. This article describes recent advances in cathode active materials with surface modification from the nano- to microscale."

The identification of similarities in the material requirements for applications of interest and those of living organisms provides opportunities to use renewable natural resources to develop better materials and design better devices. In our work, we harness this strategy to build high-capacity silicon (Si) nanopowder–based lithium (Li)–ion batteries with improved performance characteristics. Si offers more than one order of magnitude higher capacity than graphite, but it exhibits dramatic volume changes during electrochemical alloying and de-alloying with Li, which typically leads to rapid anode degradation. We show that mixing Si nanopowder with alginate, a natural polysaccharide extracted from brown algae, yields a stable battery anode possessing reversible capacity eight times higher than that of the state-of-the-art graphitic anodes."

However, to meet the user’s demands, the consumer electronics market is in continuous evolution with the production of diversified multifeature devices that require constantly increasing power levels. Therefore, it is expected that even the lithium-ion battery will soon become inadequate to meet the expectations of this fast-growing market. In addition to the consumer electronics area, high-energy batteries are also urgently needed to face the great challenges of the new millennium, namely a change of energy policy and a more accurate control of the environment of the planet. In response to these needs, which, among others, call for a wide use of clean-energy sources and for the large-scale introduction of controlled-or zero-emission vehicles, it is now essential that high-energy, low-cost, and environmentally friendly storage systems are identified. Lithium batteries could still be the best candidates for all these applications, provided that their performance reaches a level higher than that presently offered. Generally, the performance of any device depends intimately on the properties of the materials of which it is formed; this also holds for lithium batteries. The chemistry of these batteries has not changed since their introduction in the market in the early nineties. Basically, a lithium-ion battery consists of a lithium-ion intercalation negative electrode (generally graphite) and a lithium-ion intercalation positive electrode (generally LiCoO 2 , or, occasionally, the spinel LiM-n 2 O 4 ), these being separated by a lithium-ion conducting electrolyte, such as a solution of LiPF 6 in an ethylene carbonate–dimethylcarbonate (EC–DMC"

435,10.1039/c4cp00826j,2014.0,Negative electrodes for Na-ion batteries.,"Research interest in Na-ion batteries has increased rapidly because of the environmental friendliness of sodium compared to lithium. Throughout this Perspective paper, we report and review recent scientific advances in the field of negative electrode materials used for Na-ion batteries. This paper sheds light on negative electrode materials for Na-ion batteries: carbonaceous materials, oxides/phosphates (as sodium insertion materials), sodium alloy/compounds and so on. These electrode materials have different reaction mechanisms for electrochemical sodiation/desodiation processes. Moreover, not only sodiation-active materials but also binders, current collectors, electrolytes and electrode/electrolyte interphase and its stabilization are essential for long cycle life Na-ion batteries. This paper also addresses the prospect of Na-ion batteries as low-cost and long-life batteries with relatively high-energy density as their potential competitive edge over the commercialized Li-ion batteries."

However, implication of lithium metal anodes is hampered by the unstable electrochemical behavior. Herein, the fabrication of hermetic coatings of hybrid silicate on lithium metal surface using a simple vapor deposition technique under the ambient condition is reported. Such coatings consist of a “hard” inorganic moiety that helps to suppress lithium dendrites and a “soft” organic moiety that enhances the toughness. Lithium metal batteries, including Li–LiFePO4 and Li–S batteries, made with such coated anodes show significantly improved lifetime. This work provides a simple yet effective approach to stabilize lithium metal anodes for high‐performance lithium metal batteries."
437,10.1021/CM902696J,2010.0,Positive Electrode Materials for Li-Ion and Li-Batteries†,"Positive electrodes for Li-ion and lithium batteries (also termed “cathodes”) have been under intense scrutiny since the advent of the Li-ion cell in 1991. This is especially true in the past decade. Early on, carbonaceous materials dominated the negative electrode and hence most of the possible improvements in the cell were anticipated at the positive terminal; on the other hand, major developments in negative electrode materials made in the last portion of the decade with the introduction of nanocomposite Sn/C/Co alloys and Si−C composites have demanded higher capacity positive electrodes to match. Much of this was driven by the consumer market for small portable electronic devices. More recently, there has been a growing interest in developing Li−sulfur and Li−air batteries that have the potential for vastly increased capacity and energy density, which is needed to power large-scale systems. These require even more complex assemblies at the positive electrode in order to achieve good properties. This r..."
438,10.1149/1.3269928,2010.0,Effects of Nonaqueous Electrolytes on the Performance of Lithium/Air Batteries,"The effects of various properties of nonaqueous electrolytes on the performance of lithium/air batteries are investigated. The performance of a lithium/air battery is determined by the number of triphase regions formed by oxygen, electrolyte, and active carbons (with catalyst). The oxygen diffusion rate through the open channels (strongly related to the polarity of the electrolyte) is several orders of magnitude larger than that through the liquid electrolyte; therefore, the electrolyte polarity is the most important factor on the performance of lithium/air batteries compared with other properties of the electrolyte, such as oxygen solubility, viscosity, and ionic conductivity. The quantity of the electrolyte added to a cell also significantly affects the discharge performance of the lithium/air battery, and a clear maximum in capacity is observed as a function of the electrolyte amount. The addition of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as a functional additive and cosolvent in electrolytes can help dissolve partial Li 2 O and Li 2 O 2 formed during the battery discharge process, which is beneficial to increasing the discharge capacity. However, this addition also largely reduces the contact angle and increases the electrolyte viscosity, thus decreasing the discharge capacity of the lithium/air battery."

When the battery is being charged or discharged, lithium ions diffuse from one electrode to the other. Such an insertion reaction deforms the electrodes and may cause the electrodes to crack. This paper uses fracture mechanics to determine the critical conditions to avert insertion-induced cracking. The method is applied to cracks induced by the mismatch between phases in LiFePO_4."

In order to avoid problem shifting, a life cycle perspective should be applied in the environmental assessment of traction batteries. The aim of this study was to provide a transparent inventory for a lithium‐ion nickel‐cobalt‐manganese traction battery based on primary data and to report its cradle‐to‐gate impacts. The study was carried out as a process‐based attributional life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts were analyzed using midpoint indicators. The global warming potential of the 26.6 kilowatt‐hour (kWh), 253‐kilogram battery pack was found to be 4.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. Regardless of impact category, the production impacts of the battery were caused mainly by the production chains of battery cell manufacture, positive electrode paste, and negative current collector. The robustness of the study was tested through sensitivity analysis, and results were compared with preceding studies. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the most effective approach to reducing climate change emissions would be to produce the battery cells with electricity from a cleaner energy mix. On a per‐kWh basis, cradle‐to‐gate greenhouse gas emissions of the battery were within the range of those reported in preceding studies. Contribution and structural path analysis allowed for identification of the most impact‐intensive processes and value chains. This article provides an inventory based mainly on primary data, which can easily be adapted to subsequent EV studies, and offers an improved understanding of environmental burdens pertaining to lithium‐ion traction batteries."

Rechargeable batteries cover applications in many fields, which include portable electronic consumer devices, electric vehicles, and large‐scale electricity storage in smart or intelligent grids. The performance of rechargeable batteries depends essentially on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrochemical reactions involved in the components (i.e., the anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator) of the cells. During the past decade, extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing advanced batteries with large capacity, high energy and power density, high safety, long cycle life, fast response, and low cost. Here, recent progress in functional materials applied in the currently prevailing rechargeable lithium‐ion, nickel‐metal hydride, lead acid, vanadium redox flow, and sodium‐sulfur batteries is reviewed.

However, the maximum energy density of current lithium ion batteries having topatactic chemistry is not sufficient to meet the demands of new markets in such areas as electric vehicles. Therefore, new electrochemical systems with higher energy densities are being sought, and metal‐air batteries with conversion chemistry are considered a promising candidate. More recently, promising electrochemical performance has driven much research interest in Li‐air and Zn‐air batteries. This review provides an overview of the fundamentals and recent progress in the area of Li‐air and Zn‐air batteries, with the aim of providing a better understanding of the new electrochemical systems."

The lithium metal negative electrode is key to applying these new battery technologies. However, the problems of lithium dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency have proven to be difficult challenges to overcome. Fundamentally, these two issues stem from the instability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, which is easily damaged by the large volumetric changes during battery cycling. In this work, we show that when a highly viscoelastic polymer was applied to the lithium metal electrode, the morphology of the lithium deposition became significantly more uniform. At a high current density of 5 mA/cm2 we obtained a flat and dense lithium metal layer, and we observed stable cycling Coulombic efficiency of ∼97% maintained for more than 180 cycles at a current density of 1 mA/cm2."
445,10.1002/smll.200900382,2009.0,Nanostructured silicon anodes for lithium ion rechargeable batteries.,"Rechargeable lithium ion batteries are integral to today's information-rich, mobile society. Currently they are one of the most popular types of battery used in portable electronics because of their high energy density and flexible design. Despite their increasing use at the present time, there is great continued commercial interest in developing new and improved electrode materials for lithium ion batteries that would lead to dramatically higher energy capacity and longer cycle life. Silicon is one of the most promising anode materials because it has the highest known theoretical charge capacity and is the second most abundant element on earth. However, silicon anodes have limited applications because of the huge volume change associated with the insertion and extraction of lithium. This causes cracking and pulverization of the anode, which leads to a loss of electrical contact and eventual fading of capacity. Nanostructured silicon anodes, as compared to the previously tested silicon film anodes, can help overcome the above issues. As arrays of silicon nanowires or nanorods, which help accommodate the volume changes, or as nanoscale compliant layers, which increase the stress resilience of silicon films, nanoengineered silicon anodes show potential to enable a new generation of lithium ion batteries with significantly higher reversible charge capacity and longer cycle life."

This tin-based amorphous composite oxide (TCO) contains Sn(II)-O as the active center for lithium insertion and other glass-forming elements, which make up an oxide network. The TCO anode yields a specific capacity for reversible lithium adsorption more than 50 percent higher than those of the carbon families that persists after charge-discharge cycling when coupled with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode. Lithium-7 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements evidenced the high ionic state of lithium retained in the charged state, in which TCO accepted 8 moles of lithium ions per unit mole."

The synthesis is based on controlled thermal oxidative decomposition and recrystallization of precursor Co(OH)2 hexagonal nanosheets. After thermal treatment, the hexagonal sheetlike morphology can be completely preserved, despite the fact that there is a volume contraction accompanying the process: Co(OH)2-->Co3O4. Because of the intrinsic crystal contraction, a highly porous structure of the product is simultaneously created. Importantly, when evaluated as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, the as-prepared porous Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit superior Li-battery performance with good cycle life and high capacity (1450 mAh g(-1)) due to their porous sheetlike structure and small size. As far as we know, the performance of the Co3O4-based anode materials for lithium batteries presented here is the best up to now. Considering the improved performance and cost-effective synthesis, the as-prepared porous Co3O4 nanosheets might be suitable as anode electrodes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries."

449,10.1039/B915838C,2009.0,Electrochemical performance of graphene nanosheets and ceramic composites as anodes for lithium batteries,"A nanocomposite anode material for lithium batteries is designed and fabricated by the insertion of graphite nanosheets (GNS) into the ceramic network of silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramics for the development of structurally and electrochemically stable lithium batteries. The GNS forms a layered phase in the SiOC ceramic network from the self-assembly of graphite oxides (GO) introduced in a polysiloxane precursor through thermal transformations after pyrolysis. The composite anode (GNS/SiOC) exhibits an initial discharge capacity attaining 1141 mAh g−1. The discharging capacity decreases in the first eight cycles and stays at 364 mAh g−1 in the following cycles. This reversible discharging capacity is higher than that of a graphite reference (328 mAh g−1) and a SiOC monolithic. Correlating the discharge capacities to the material compositions and structures suggest that the interface between SiOC and GNS contributes to the enhanced capacity of the composite anode, in addition to those from GNS and SiOC. Further increasing the electrochemical performance is possible by the increase of the amount of GNS in the composite."
450,10.1002/ADMA.200602592,2007.0,Black Phosphorus and its Composite for Lithium Rechargeable Batteries,"Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries are used as portable power sources for a wide variety of electronic devices, such as cellular phones, notebook computers, and camcorders. Intensive research efforts have been made over the past decade to increase the gravimetric and volumetric energy density of lithium ion batteries. At present, graphite (372 mAhg) is used as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, but higher capacity alternatives are being actively pursued. Among the many possible alternatives, a lot of work has been devoted to Sn-based oxide, Si-based composite, transition metal oxide, metal nitride and metal phosphide systems, due to their ability to react reversibly with large amounts of Li per formula unit. Although alloy-based systems have a higher energy density, they suffer from poor capacity retention, since a large volume change occurs during charge/discharge. Among these alternatives, a concept based on the quasi-topotactic intercalation mechanism was proposed, in which lithium is inserted into monoclinic binary MnP4 to form the cubic ternary Li7MnP4 phase. [10] Since then, Li insertion/extraction in transition metal phosphides has been investigated as a possible candidate for the anode material in lithium ion batteries. In these systems, commercial red P and transition metals were used to synthesize metal phosphides, but the energy density is reduced due to the heavy transition metals employed. If phosphorus were used for electrode materials, it would have a good energy density, but little is known about its electrochemical behavior, since commercial red P has an amorphous structure with a poor bulk conductivity and poor cyclability. Phosphorus, an element of the fifth group in the periodic table, has three main allotropes: white, red, and black. Among these modifications of allotropes, black phosphorus is thermodynamically the most stable, insoluble in most solvents, practically non-flammable, and chemically the least reactive form, and exists in three known crystalline modifications (orthorhombic, rhombohedral, and simple cubic), as well as in an amorphous form. Since orthorhombic black phosphorus was obtained from white phosphorus at 200 C and 1.2 GPa, many studies designed to synthesize black phosphorus have been reported. However, the basic concept of a high temperature and high pressure being required has not been changed, and black phosphorus still remains difficult to synthesize, and has the lowest commercial value of the three forms. Considering that orthorhombic black phosphorus exhibits a layer structure similar to that of graphite, which is currently used as an anode material for Li ion batteries, we developed a simple method of transforming commercially available amorphous red phosphorus into orthorhombic black phosphorus using a high energy mechanical milling (HEMM) technique at ambient temperature and pressure. It is known that the temperature during HEMM can rise above 200 C and the pressure generated can be of the order of 6 GPa. These conditions should be sufficient to transform red P into its high-pressure allotrope, the black phosphorus phase, at ambient temperature and pressure. Figure 1a shows the color photo image, XRD pattern, and TEM electron diffraction pattern showing a diffuse ring of red P, which confirms the amorphous nature of the red P. The sample prepared by HEMM corresponds to orthorhombic black P according to the XRD data and color photo image (Fig. 1b), and was also identified by high resolution TEM electron diffraction, and by its lattice spacing. Figure 2a and 2b show the voltage profiles of red P and black P, respectively. Their electrochemical behaviors are very different from each other. The discharge and charge capacities of red P are 1692 and 67 mAhg, respectively, and it cannot be used as an anode material since its charge capacity is negligible. Although black P shows an increased charge capacity of 1279 mAhg, the first cycle efficiency is only 57%. The electrochemical performance of Si as an anode material for Li ion batteries can be much improved using Si–carbon composites. Black P also has a low electronic conductivity inherited from its characteristic as a semiconductor. The electrochemical behaviors of the black P-carbon composite during the discharge/charge reaction with Li were excellent compared with the above two cases, as shown in Figure 2c. The first discharge and charge capacities are 2010 and 1814 mAhg, respectively, and the first cycle efficiency is about 90%, which is one of the highest reported. The good coulombic efficiency of the black P–carbon composite for the C O M M U N IC A IO N"

Rechargeable metal–air batteries, mainly lithium–air and zinc–air systems, are considered one of the most promising candidates.

An aging model, based on the concept of accumulated charge throughput, has been developed to estimate battery life under “real world” driving cycles (custom driving cycles based on driving statistics). The objective is to determine the “damage” on the life related to each driving pattern to determine equivalent miles/years. Results indicates that Lithium-ion batteries appear to be 10 year/150,000 mile capable, provided that they are not overcharged, nor consistently operated at high temperatures, nor in charge sustaining mode at a very low state of charge."
453,10.1002/ADMA.200502604,2006.0,Enhancement of the High‐Rate Capability of Solid‐State Lithium Batteries by Nanoscale Interfacial Modification,"Rechargeable lithium batteries are widely used in portable equipment today. However, there have always been safety issues arising from their combustible organic electrolytes. These issues are becoming more serious with the increasing size of batteries for use in electric vehicle (EV) or load-leveling applications. Nonflammable solid electrolytes would be the ultimate solution to the safety issue. Despite their high safety, the energy densities and power densities of solid systems have been too low for their practical use. We have succeeded in increasing their energy densities to levels comparable to those of liquid ones. However, power densities, or high-rate capabilities, remain poor. In this communication, we report that a buffer film with a thickness of only several nanometers interposed between the electrode and electrolyte materials improves the high-rate capability of solid-state lithium batteries. Low ionic conductivities of solid electrolytes have been the reason for the poor high-rate capability of solid-state lithium batteries. Although the conductivities of recently discovered solid electrolytes (> 10 S cm) are slightly lower than those observed for liquid electrolytes, Li ionic conduction in the solid electrolytes has become as fast as that of liquid electrolytes, by taking into account the fact that the transport number of ions in inorganic electrolytes is unity. However, the high-rate capability of solid systems, including solid electrolytes, remains inferior. This fact strongly suggests that the rate-controlling step is not in the bulk of the solid electrolytes, but at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte materials. Ionic conduction at interfaces between different kinds of ionic conductors, or heterojunctions, is characterized by the term “nanoionics”; a frontier study was done for a LiI– Al2O3 composite, [7] and a sophisticated example was presented by Sata et al. In the latter, two kinds of F ion conductors, BaF2 and CaF2, were brought into contact with each other. Part of the F ions then transferred from one side to the other to reach an equilibrium, which produced vacancies in the former and interstitial ions in the latter, both of which contributed to ionic conduction at the interface and enhanced the ionic conduction. Similar nanoionic phenomena should take place at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte materials, forming a space-charge layer. Because the compositions and structures of solid electrolytes have been well tailored to achieve high ionic conductivities, the ionic conductivity of the space-charge layer, where the compositions deviate from the optima, should be lower than that of the bulk, increasing the interfacial resistance. For instance, the Li4GeS4–Li3PS4 (thio-LISICON) system used in the present study has a high ionic conductivity of the order of 10 S cm at its optimum composition. However, variation in the composition reduces it to 10 S cm. The detrimental increase in the interfacial resistance would be prominent in bulk-type or non-thin-film solid-state lithium batteries. Sulfide electrolytes should be used in such batteries, because the ionic conductivities of oxide solid electrolytes, for example, are so low that they are available only in thin-film systems. On the other hand, the cathode should be an oxide, such as LiCoO2, because of its high electrode potential. [10,11]"

This article presents a review of our recent progress dedicated to the anode and cathode materials that have the potential to fulfil the crucial factors of cost, safety, lifetime, durability, power density, and energy density. Nanostructured inorganic compounds have been extensively investigated. Size effects revealed in the storage of lithium through micropores (hard carbon spheres), alloys (Si, SnSb), and conversion reactions (Cr2O3, MnO) are studied. The formation of nano/micro core–shell, dispersed composite, and surface pinning structures can improve their cycling performance. Surface coating on LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4 was found to be an effective way to enhance their thermal and chemical stability and the mechanisms are discussed.

To evaluate those losses and to make an efficient design, good models are required for system simulation. Subzero battery operation involves nonclassical thermal behavior. Consequently, simple electrical models are not sufficient to predict bad performance or damage to systems involving batteries at subzero temperatures. This paper presents the development of an electrical and thermal model of an HEV lithium-ion battery pack. This model has been developed with MATLAB/Simulink to investigate the output characteristics of lithium-ion batteries over the selected operating range of currents and battery capacities. In addition, a thermal modeling method has been developed for this model so that it can predict the battery core and crust temperature by including the effect of internal resistance. First, various discharge tests on one cell are carried out, and then, cell's parameters and thermal characteristics are obtained. The single-cell model proposed is shown to be accurate by analyzing the simulation data and test results. Next, real working conditions tests are performed, and simulation calculations on one cell are presented. In the end, the simulation results of a battery pack under HEV driving cycle conditions show that the characteristics of the proposed model allow a good comparison with data from an actual lithium-ion battery pack used in an HEV."

465,10.1109/TSMC.2015.2389757,2015.0,A Health Indicator Extraction and Optimization Framework for Lithium-Ion Battery Degradation Modeling and Prognostics,"Maximum releasable capacity and internal resistance are often used as the health indicators (HIs) of a lithium-ion battery for degradation modeling and estimation of remaining useful life (RUL). However, the maximum releasable capacity is usually difficult to estimate in online applications due to complex operating conditions in the field. Moreover, measuring the internal resistance is too expensive to be implemented on-line. In this paper, an HI extraction and optimization framework requiring only the operating parameters of lithium-ion batteries is proposed for battery degradation modeling and RUL estimation. The framework carries out raw HI extraction, transformation, correlation analysis, and verification and evaluation to achieve HI enhancement. In particular, the Box-Cox transformation is adopted to improve the correlation between the extracted HI and the battery's actual degradation state. To estimate the battery's RUL using the enhanced HI, an optimized relevance vector-machine algorithm is utilized, which can be performed in a flexible and agile way. Experimental studies using two different industrial testing data sets illustrate the high efficiency and adaptability of the proposed framework in lithium-ion battery degradation modeling and RUL estimation."

It has previously been believed that cation ordering is unaffected by repeated electrochemical removal and insertion. The authors have conducted direct observations, at the particle scale, of damage and cation disorder induced in LiCoO{sub 2} cathodes by electrochemical cycling. Using transmission electron microscopy imaging and electron diffraction, it was found that (1) individual LiCoO{sub 2} particles in a cathode cycled from 1.5 to 4.35 V against a Li anode are subject to widely varying degrees of damage; (2) cycling induces severe strain, high defect densities, and occasional fracture of particles; and (3) severely strained particles exhibit two types of cation disorder, defects on octahedral site layers (including cation substitutions and vacancies) as well as a partial transformation to spinel tetrahedral site ordering. The damage and cation disorder are localized and have not been detected by conventional bulk characterization techniques such as X-ray or neutron diffraction. Cumulative damage of this nature may be responsible for property degradation during overcharging or in long-term cycling of LiCoO{sub 2}-based rechargeable lithium batteries."

Compared to the comprehensive body of work on lithium-ion batteries, research on sodium-ion batteries is still at the germination stage. Since both sodium and lithium are alkali metals, they share similar chemical properties including ionicity, electronegativity and electrochemical reactivity. They accordingly have comparable synthetic protocols and electrochemical performances, which indicates that sodium-ion batteries can be successfully developed based on previously applied approaches or methods in the lithium counterpart. The electrode materials in Li-ion batteries provide the best library for research on Na-ion batteries because many Na-ion insertion hosts have their roots in Li-ion insertion hosts. However, the larger size and different bonding characteristics of sodium ions influence the thermodynamic and/or kinetic properties of sodium-ion batteries, which leads to unexpected behaviour in electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism, compared to lithium-ion batteries.

489,10.1149/1.2360769,2006.0,Improving Lithium Batteries by Tethering Carbon-Coated LiFePO4 to Polypyrrole,"The demand for rechargeable lithium batteries, which have ushered in the wireless revolution and have found a place in the hybrid electric vehicle, is rapidly expanding. Commercial use commonly requires high power, high energy density, and high rate capability. However, achieving a high capacity at a high charge/discharge rate has proven difficult. In this paper, we show a remarkable improvement in the rate capability and capacity of cathodes using carbon-coated LiFePO 4 by replacing the carbon plus Teflon additives with polypyrrole (PPy) bonded to the oxide particles by the carbon coat. An excellent charge/discharge performance at a rate as high as 10C, and even a 3 min (20C) charge, is demonstrated with a C-LiFePO 4 /PPy cathode containing 16 wt % PPy. Attaching a conductive polymer to an active oxide particle is a general strategy that also promises to enhance the rate capability of other cathode composites used in rechargeable lithium batteries."
490,10.1149/1.2168051,2006.0,Thermal Analysis of Spirally Wound Lithium Batteries,"A two-dimensional thermal model is developed to establish a standard for the simulation of spirally wound cells. It properly deals with the geometric characteristics and the boundary conditions to avoid the distorted simulation results due to improper approximation of the spiral geometry. Furthermore, the flexible architecture makes it possible that the precision of the numerical solutions can be elevated by spending more time on calculation. According to the simulation of lithium batteries under natural convection, the hottest temperatures are in a circular region near the liquid-filled hollow core but not at the exact center. Furthermore, radiation contributes as much as 53.6% to the heat dissipation if the surface emissivity approaches unity. Adopting an air flow parallel to the cylinder axis is effective to suppress the surface temperature, but the hottest temperature inside a battery remains high if a battery has a large radius. The heat dissipation rate of an air flow perpendicular to the cylinder axis is slightly lower than that of a parallel flow, and a battery case with high thermal conductivity is suggested to maintain the temperature uniformity of a battery."

492,10.1002/anie.201407103,2014.0,Carbon nanofibers decorated with molybdenum disulfide nanosheets: synergistic lithium storage and enhanced electrochemical performance.,"Traditional lithium-ion batteries that are based on layered Li intercalation electrode materials are limited by the intrinsically low theoretical capacities of both electrodes and cannot meet the increasing demand for energy. A facile route for the synthesis of a new type of composite nanofibers, namely carbon nanofibers decorated with molybdenum disulfide sheets (CNFs@MoS2), is now reported. A synergistic effect was observed for the two-component anode, triggering new electrochemical processes for lithium storage, with a persistent oxidation from Mo (or MoS2) to MoS3 in the repeated charge processes, leading to an ascending capacity upon cycling. The composite exhibits unprecedented electrochemical behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and superior high-rate capability, suggesting its potential application in high-energy lithium-ion batteries."
493,10.1149/1.1391560,1999.0,Rubbery Block Copolymer Electrolytes for Solid‐State Rechargeable Lithium Batteries,"For nearly 20 years, poly(ethylene oxide)-based materials have been researched for use as electrolytes in solid-state rechargeab le lithium batteries. Technical obstacles to commercialization derive from the inability to satisfy simultaneously the electrical and mechanical performance requirements: high ionic conductivity along with resistance to flow. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of a series of poly(lauryl methacrylate)- b-poly[oligo(oxyethylene) methacrylate]-based block copolymer electrolytes (BCEs) are reported. With both blocks in the rubbery state (i.e., having glass transition temperatures well below room temperatu re) these materials exhibit improved conductivities over those of glassy-rubbery block copolymer systems. Dynamic rheological testing verifies that these materials are dimensionally stable, whereas cyclic voltammetry shows them to be electrochemically stable over a wide potential window, i.e., up to 5 V at 55 8C. A solid-state rechargeable lithium battery was constructed by laminating lithium metal, BCE, and a composite cathode composed of particles of LiAl0.25Mn0.75O2 (monoclinic), carbon black, and graphite in a BCE binder. Cycle testing showed the Li/BCE/LiAl0.25Mn0.75O2 battery to have a high reversible capacity and good capacity"

495,10.1039/C6TA05439K,2016.0,Interfacial behaviours between lithium ion conductors and electrode materials in various battery systems,"In recent years room temperature Li+ ion conductors have been intensively revisited in an attempt to develop solid state batteries that can be deployed for vehicle electrification. Through careful modification on materials synthesis, promising solid Li+ conductors with competitive ionic conductivity to those of liquid electrolytes have been demonstrated. However, the integration of highly conductive solid electrolytes into the whole system is still very challenging mainly due to the high impedance existing at different interfaces throughout the battery structure. Herein, this work focuses on the overview of the interfacial behaviors between lithium ion (Li-ion) conductors and cathode/anode materials. The origin, evolution and potential solutions to reduce these interfacial impedances are reviewed for various battery systems spanning from Li-ion, lithium sulfur (Li–S), lithium oxygen (Li–O2) batteries to lithium metal protection."
496,10.1149/1.1838831,1998.0,An Advanced Tool for the Selection of Electrolyte Components for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries,"The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in lithium-metal, lithium-alloy, and lithium-ion batteries. The SEI on both lithium and carbonaceous electrodes consists of many different materials including LiF, Li{sub 2}CO{sub 3}, LiCO{sub 2}-R, Li{sub 2}O, lithium alkoxides, nonconductive polymers, and more. Close to the lithium or Li{sub x}C{sub 6} the SEI consists of the thermodynamically stable anions, such as O{sup 2{minus}}, S{sup 2{minus}}, and halides. Close to the solution the SEI also contains partially reduced materials such as polyolefins, semicarbonates, etc. These materials form simultaneously and precipitate on the electrode as a mosaic of microphases. These phases may, under certain conditions, form separate layers, but in general it is more appropriate to treat them as heteropolymicrophases. The SEI composition and properties depend strongly on electrolyte composition and on other factors. Rapid formation of the SEI is important in all lithium batteries, especially in the case of lithium-ion cells with graphite anodes. Hence SEI precursors must be selected from a group of materials that have high exchange current density (i{sub 0}) for reduction. As it is difficult to measure i{sub 0} on solid electrodes and only limited data, if any, are available, it is suggested to use the datamore » bank for the rate constant for the reduction of electrolyte components by hydrated electrons (e{sub aq}{sup {minus}}). The authors have demonstrated that the rate constants of the reactions of solvated electrons and electrolyte components and impurities correlate well with the formation voltage of SEI and with SEI composition. Thus, the rate constants (k{sub e}) for these reactions are proposed as a tool for the first screening of electrolyte components when a new electrolyte is designed.« less"
497,,1998.0,Esophageal electrochemical burns due to button type lithium batteries in dogs.,"Incidences of swallowing lithium batteries have been increasing. More severe tissue damage may be produced by the flow of electric current through tissue due to a lithium battery than a button alkali battery, because the former has the higher voltage of 3V. In this study, model CR2032 lithium batteries were fixed in the esophagus of 5 adult mongrel dogs for 15 or 30 min or 1, 2 or 5 h. On microscopical examination of the esophagus 15 min after fixation of the battery, necrosis was demonstrated from the lamina propria mucosa to the inner muscular layer. Thirty min after fixation of the battery, the esophageal epithelium had completely disappeared to form a blackish-brown area and the outer muscular layer was partially necrosed. Histological findings after 1, 2 or 5 h were similar to those after 30 min, and the blackish-brown area became larger with time. The necrosis extended to the trachea after 1 h. The necrosis developed sooner in tissue in contact with the lithium battery. An ingested lithium battery appears to be more dangerous than a button alkali battery unless it is removed quickly."
498,10.1039/CS9972600259,1997.0,Rechargeable lithium batteries,"The market for lithium batteries is undergoing a rapid expansion as new applications demand higher densities of energy and power storage. Simple theoretical estimates show that lithium and lithium ion cells can reach specific energies of 880 and 500 W h kg–1 respectively. With an electrolyte conductivity above 3 × 10–4 S cm–1 and thickness below 0.01 cm, a power density of 300 W dm–3 can be obtained without excessive energy losses. Diffusion in porous or polymer composite electrodes is enhanced by an interpenetrating electrolyte provided the electrode particles are small. Batteries using transition metal oxide positive electrodes and carbon negative electrodes are expected to give practical specific energies up to 180 W. h kg–1 including packaging and other essential additional materials in the near future."
499,10.1557/MRS2002.199,2002.0,Lithium Batteries for Biomedical Applications,"Lithium batteries have been successfully used in implantable biomedical devices for the last 30 years, and in some cases the use of lithium power sources has significantly contributed to the viability of the device. These battery systems fall into two major categories: primary, or single-use, cells containing lithium-metal anodes; and secondary, or rechargeable, systems utilizing lithium-ion chemistry. Primary lithium batteries have been used for implantable devices such as cardiac pacemakers, drug pumps, neurostimulators, and cardiac defibrillators. Rechargeable batteries have been used with left ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts. All of these cells share the characteristics of high safety, reliability, energy density, and predictability of performance. Additionally, state-of-charge indication and low self-discharge are important features, along with charging safety and high cycle life for rechargeable cells."
