0,10.12688/gatesopenres.14511.1,2023,Complexity of options related to restarting oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in national immunization programs after OPV cessation,"Background: The polio eradication endgame continues to increase in complexity. With polio cases caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses of all three types (1, 2 and 3) reported in 2022, the number, formulation, and use of poliovirus vaccines poses challenges for national immunization programs and vaccine suppliers. Prior poliovirus transmission modeling of globally-coordinated type-specific cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) assumed creation of Sabin monovalent OPV (mOPV) stockpiles for emergencies and explored the potential need to restart OPV if the world reached a specified cumulative threshold number of cases after OPV cessation. Methods: We document the actual experience of type 2 OPV (OPV2) cessation and reconsider prior modeling assumptions related to OPV restart. We develop updated decision trees of national immunization options for poliovirus vaccines considering different possibilities for OPV restart. Results: While OPV restart represented a hypothetical situation for risk management and contingency planning to support the 2013-2018 Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Strategic Plan, the actual epidemiological experience since OPV2 cessation raises questions about what, if any, trigger(s) could lead to restarting the use of OPV2 in routine immunization and/or plans for potential future restart of type 1 and 3 OPV after their respective cessation. The emergency use listing of a genetically stabilized novel type 2 OPV (nOPV2) and continued evaluation of nOPV for types 1 and/or 3 add further complexity by increasing the combinations of possible OPV formulations for OPV restart. Conclusions: Expanding on a 2019 discussion of the logistical challenges and implications of restarting OPV, we find a complex structure of the many options and many issues related to OPV restart decisions and policies as of early 2023. We anticipate many challenges for forecasting prospective vaccine supply needs during the polio endgame due to increasing potential combinations of poliovirus vaccine choices."
1,10.1002/aenm.202001864,2020,Material Strategies to Accelerate OPV Technology Toward a GW Technology,"With the rise of the solar power century, photovoltaic applications and installations will go beyond the traditional green field power plants and enter any aspect of daily life. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) demonstrate certified cell efficiencies of over 17% and are expected to contribute to versatile applications powered by solar energy, for instance, applications rely on flexibility, transparency, color management, or integrability. In this work, the progress of OPV technology is briefly reviewed and the material strategies to accelerate OPV technology toward a GW era are analyzed. In addition to the exciting efficiency values achieved for small area devices, there are many important criteria deciding the success of OPV technology. By taking into consideration the synthetic complexity of OPV materials and the operational stability of OPV devices, the industrial figure of merit (i‐FoM) is proposed as a fast and reliable method to verify the true potential of a novel material. Furthermore, “soft” key performance indicators are introduced, such as toxicity, flexibility, transparency, processing, which require different development strategies to reflect the potential of OPV technology for specific applications."
2,10.1002/adma.201907801,2019,Beyond Ternary OPV: High‐Throughput Experimentation and Self‐Driving Laboratories Optimize Multicomponent Systems,"Fundamental advances to increase the efficiency as well as stability of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are achieved by designing ternary blends, which represents a clear trend toward multicomponent active layer blends. The development of high‐throughput and autonomous experimentation methods is reported for the effective optimization of multicomponent polymer blends for OPVs. A method for automated film formation enabling the fabrication of up to 6048 films per day is introduced. Equipping this automated experimentation platform with a Bayesian optimization, a self‐driving laboratory is constructed that autonomously evaluates measurements to design and execute the next experiments. To demonstrate the potential of these methods, a 4D parameter space of quaternary OPV blends is mapped and optimized for photostability. While with conventional approaches, roughly 100 mg of material would be necessary, the robot‐based platform can screen 2000 combinations with less than 10 mg, and machine‐learning‐enabled autonomous experimentation identifies stable compositions with less than 1 mg."
3,10.7575/aiac.ijels.v.9n.4p.45,2021,Using Online Photovoice (OPV) to Understand Youths’ Perceptions of Distance Education during COVID-19,"In this study we aimed to investigate young college students’ experienced problems and support resources regarding online or distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used an innovative technique, Online Photovoice (OPV) method to collect data. The research includes the theoretical framework created to understand the factors that facilitate and complicate online/distance education processes for prospective teachers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the framework consisted of Ecological Systems Theory (EST), Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), and OPV. In the analysis of the data, we used Online Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (OIPA). The study sample consisted of 153 young university students in three universities in the south and southeast of Turkey. The data collection tool was created as an online form consisting of four parts: introduction, general information, and consent form; questions on the most important facilitator and the most important barrier in your life for your online/distance education during the COVID-19 process using OPV; and demographic questions section. When the facilitating factors obtained from the study data were examined, 11 main themes emerged. These main themes were having online or distance education (37%), technology, computer, internet, and helpful course programs (30%), and private space (10%). On the other hand, 16 complicating main themes have emerged including insufficient technology (32%), problems with online education (15%), and financial issues (12%). The participants attributed facilitators and barriers to EST levels, respectively: individual/intrapsychic factors (47%, 43%), microsystem (19%, 48%), exosystem (36%, 37%), and macrosystem (26%, 34%)."
4,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2021.3052767,2021,Outdoor Assessment and Performance Evaluation of OPV Modules,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules have significant advantages over conventional PV technologies drawing the attention of R&D activities. The OPV efficiency is increasing closing the gap against silicon-based modules. This article describes an experimental campaign performed at SolarTechLAB to assess the performance of six OPV modules in real environmental conditions (module nominal power 17.5 Wp). The first part of the activity was dedicated to the photoactivation process, which is a well-known phenomenon of this kind of modules. Measurements pointed out that the OPV modules reach stable conditions after collecting 10 kWh/m2 of solar radiation independently from the module conditions during the procedure. A second relevant result is about the reversibility of the photoactivation process: experiments showed that activated modules left in the dark for several days lose the activation indicating the reversibility of the process. Finally, in the second part, the performances of the six OPV modules have been analyzed and benchmarked against silicon (c-Si) and CIS photovoltaic technology. The measured electric efficiency of the six OPV modules under real environmental conditions was below 4%, which is significantly lower than 20% and 15% measured for c-Si and CIS modules under the same conditions."
5,10.1111/risa.13555,2020,Updated Characterization of Post‐OPV Cessation Risks: Lessons from 2019 Serotype 2 Outbreaks and Implications for the Probability of OPV Restart,"After the globally coordinated cessation of any serotype of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), some risks remain from undetected, existing homotypic OPV‐related transmission and/or restarting transmission due to several possible reintroduction risks. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of serotype 2‐containing OPV (OPV2) in 2016. Following OPV2 cessation, the GPEI and countries implemented activities to withdraw all the remaining trivalent OPV, which contains all three poliovirus serotypes (i.e., 1, 2, and 3), from the supply chain and replace it with bivalent OPV (containing only serotypes 1 and 3). However, as of early 2020, monovalent OPV2 use for outbreak response continues in many countries. In addition, outbreaks observed in 2019 demonstrated evidence of different types of risks than previously modeled. We briefly review the 2019 epidemiological experience with serotype 2 live poliovirus outbreaks and propose a new risk for unexpected OPV introduction for inclusion in global modeling of OPV cessation. Using an updated model of global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution with and without consideration of this new risk, we explore the implications of the current global situation with respect to the likely need to restart preventive use of OPV2 in OPV‐using countries. Simulation results without this new risk suggest OPV2 restart will likely need to occur (81% of 100 iterations) to manage the polio endgame based on the GPEI performance to date with existing vaccine tools, and with the new risk of unexpected OPV introduction the expected OPV2 restart probability increases to 89%. Contingency planning requires new OPV2 bulk production, including genetically stabilized OPV2 strains."
6,10.1002/adma.201703980,2017,Highly Efficient Porphyrin‐Based OPV/Perovskite Hybrid Solar Cells with Extended Photoresponse and High Fill Factor,"Employing a layer of bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) organic semiconductors on top of perovskite to further extend its photoresponse is considered as a simple and promising way to enhance the efficiency of perovskite‐based solar cells, instead of using tandem devices or near infrared (NIR)‐absorbing Sn‐containing perovskites. However, the progress made from this approach is quite limited because very few such hybrid solar cells can simultaneously show high short‐circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF). To find an appropriate NIR‐absorbing BHJ is essential for highly efficient, organic, photovoltaics (OPV)/perovskite hybrid solar cells. The materials involved in the BHJ layer not only need to have broad photoresponse to increase JSC, but also possess suitable energy levels and high mobility to afford high VOC and FF. In this work, a new porphyrin is synthesized and blended with [6,6]‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to function as an efficient BHJ for OPV/perovskite hybrid solar cells. The extended photoresponse, well‐matched energy levels, and high hole mobility from optimized BHJ morphology afford a very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) (19.02%) with high Voc, JSC, and FF achieved simultaneously. This is the highest value reported so far for such hybrid devices, which demonstrates the feasibility of further improving the efficiency of perovskite devices."
7,10.1088/2058-8585/ab6e73,2020,Flexible OPV modules for highly efficient indoor applications,"The comparison of solution processed organic photovoltaics with two roll-to-roll coated electron transport layers (ETL), as well as printed grid or solid back electrodes provides insight into the future of R2R fabricated architectures. The variation in performance of the R2R slot-die coated zinc oxide (ZnO) versus the tin oxide (SnO2), showed a clear dependence on the spectrum of the illumination source. It was found that under indoor light conditions (200–1000 lux LED and fluorescent sources) the SnO2 outperformed the ZnO with highest efficiencies near 13% and 10% respectively. This is in contrast to results obtained under 1 Sun (AM 1.5) in which the cells fabricated with a ZnO ETL had a higher power conversion efficiency than those prepared with SnO2. The results also confirm the significance of the layout of the printed silver back contact; in which cells with the grid structure outperformed those with full coverage by approximately 35% for ZnO and just under 10% for SnO2 (all light conditions). The combination of a R2R coating and S2S printing process to prepare modules with 8 cells in series (PET/ITO/SnO2/PV2001:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/silver grid) resulted in a PCE of 13.4% under indoor office light conditions."
8,10.1111/risa.13590,2020,Expected Implications of Globally Coordinated Cessation of Serotype 3 Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV) Before Serotype 1 OPV,"Globally coordinated cessation of all three serotypes of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) represents a critical part of a successful polio endgame, which the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) plans to conduct in phases, with serotype 2 OPV cessation completed in mid 2016. Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete. With increasing time since the last reported polio case caused by serotype 3 wild poliovirus (in November 2012) leading to high confidence about its successful global eradication, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication recently certified its eradication. Questions now arise about the optimal timing of serotype 3 OPV (OPV3) cessation. Using an integrated global model that characterizes the risks, costs, and benefits of global polio policy and risk management options, we explored the implications of different options for coordinated cessation of OPV3 prior to COVID‐19. Globally coordinating cessation of OPV3 as soon as possible offers the opportunity to reduce cases of vaccine‐associated paralytic polio globally. In addition, earlier cessation of OPV3 should reduce the risks of creating serotype 3 circulating vaccine‐derived polioviruses after OPV3 cessation, which represents a significant threat to the polio endgame given current GPEI plans to reduce preventive OPV supplemental immunization activities starting in 2019."
9,10.1080/14760584.2019.1635463,2019,Logistical challenges and assumptions for modeling the failure of global cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV),"ABSTRACT Introduction: The inability to successfully stop all use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) as part of the polio endgame and/or the possibilities of reintroduction of live polioviruses after successful OPV cessation may imply the need to restart OPV production and use, either temporarily or permanently. Areas covered: Complementing prior work that explored the risks of potential OPV restart, we discuss the logistical challenges and implications of restarting OPV in the future, and we develop appropriate assumptions for modeling the possibility of OPV restart. The complexity of phased cessation of the three OPV serotypes implies different potential combinations of OPV use long term. We explore the complexity of polio vaccine choices and key unresolved policy questions that may impact continuing and future use of OPV and/or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). We then characterize the assumptions required to quantitatively model OPV restart in prospective global-integrated economic policy models for the polio endgame. Expert commentary: Depending on the timing, restarting production of OPV would imply some likely delays associated with ramp-up, re-licensing, and other logistics that would impact the availability and costs of restarting the use of OPV in national immunization programs after globally coordinated cessation of one or more OPV serotypes."
10,10.3390/EN12101870,2019,Energy and Luminous Performance Investigation of an OPV/ETFE Glazing Element for Building Integration,"The combination of architectural membranes such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) foils and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells offers a wide range of possibilities for building integration applications. This is due to their flexibility, free-shape, variable color and semitransparency, light weight, cost-effectivity, and low environmental impact. In addition, electrical generation is provided. Four configurations of ETFE foils designed to be integrated onto a south façade glazing element were studied for two representative European locations with different climatic conditions: Barcelona and Paris. These configurations comprise a reference one based on a double ETFE foil with a 10 mm air gap in between, and the other three incorporate on the inner ETFE foil either OPV cells covering 50% or 100% of its surface or a shading pattern printed on it covering 50% of its surface. Results show that, in terms of energy, the configuration with higher OPV coverage area is the one achieving the lowest net energy consumption in both locations. However, when looking at the illumination comfort this option results in insufficient illumination levels. Therefore, a tradeoff strategy balancing energy performance and illumination comfort conditions is necessary. Based on that, the best solution found for both cities is the configuration integrating OPV cells covering 50% of the glazing area and for a window to wall ratio of 0.45."
11,10.1002/pip.3115,2019,All sub‐nanosecond laser monolithic interconnection of OPV modules,"Although green femtosecond lasers provide outstanding quality and wide processing windows for monolithic interconnection of the individual cells in organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules, they are hardly used in commercial applications, due to cost reasons. In this work, a process has been developed that allows the monolithic interconnection in OPV modules with an infrared sub‐nanosecond laser exclusively, without compromising the performance of the modules. While the photoactive layer is removed easily by green femtosecond pulses without damaging the bottom electrode, this is not possible for infrared nanosecond pulses, due to their much larger optical penetration length, which significantly exceeds the thickness of the active layer and is well absorbed by the indium tin oxide (ITO) layer. This leads to damage of the ITO bottom electrode, which in turn compromises the functionality of the module. By systematically varying single‐pulse laser fluence and spatial pulse overlap, the laser parameters are optimized in such a way that the contact area between the residues of the metal oxide bottom electrode and the silver nanowire top electrode is maximized so that the electrical resistances of the contacts are sufficiently small not to affect device performance. This is demonstrated by presenting large‐area OPV modules based on the well‐characterized reference system P3HT:PCBM that show efficiencies of up to 2.4%. This achievement opens up the way towards reliable roll‐to‐roll (R2R) laser patterning processes with sub‐nanosecond lasers and thus represents a breakthrough with respect to cost‐effective R2R manufacturing of OPV modules, due to grossly reduced investment and maintenance costs for laser sources."
12,10.1002/aenm.201602226,2017,Charge Transfer Processes in OPV Materials as Revealed by EPR Spectroscopy,"Understanding charge separation and charge transport at a molecular level is crucial for improving the efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Under illumination of Bulk Heterojunction (BHJ) blends of polymers and fullerenes, various paramagnetic species are formed including polymer and fullerene radicals, radical pairs, and photoexcited triplet states. Light‐induced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is ideally suited to study these states in BHJ due to its selectivity in probing the paramagnetic intermediates. Advanced techniques like pulsed EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy allow the determination of hyperfine coupling tensors, while high‐frequency EPR allows the EPR signals of the individual species to be resolved and their g‐tensors to be determined. The magnetic resonance parameters of the various polymer donors reveal details about the delocalization of the positive polaron which is important for the efficient charge separation in BHJ systems. Time‐resolved EPR can contribute to the study of the dynamics of charge separation, charge transfer and recombination in BHJ by probing the unique spectral signatures of charge transfer and triplet states. EPR also has the potential to allow characterization of intermediates and products of BHJ degradation."

The way to a no-loss up-scaling process is highlighted: photoelectrical conversion efficiencies of 5.3% are achieved on rigid modules and of 4.2% on flexible, roll coated ones, employing a commercially available photoactive material. Exceptionally high geometric fill factors (98.5%), achieved via structuring by ultrashort laser pulses, with interconnection widths below 100 μm are demonstrated."
14,10.1021/ACS.CHEMMATER.8B03455,2018,Impact of Polymer Side Chain Modification on OPV Morphology and Performance,"Efficiencies of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have been steadily climbing, but there is still a prominent gap in understanding the relationship between fabrication and performance. Side chain substitution is one processing parameter that can change OPV device efficiency considerably, primarily because of variations in morphology. In this work, we explain the morphological link between side chain selection and device performance in one polymer to aid in the development of design rules more broadly. We study the morphology of an OPV active layer using a PBDTTPD-backbone polymer with four different side chain configurations, which are shown to change device efficiency by up to 4 times. The optimal device has the smallest domain sizes, the highest degree of crystallinity, and the most face-on character. This is achieved with two branched 2-ethylhexyl (2EH) side chains placed symmetrically on the BDT unit and a linear octyl (C8) side chain on the TPD unit. Substituting either side chain (C14 on BDT and/or..."
15,10.1002/adma.201302031,2014,25th Anniversary Article: Rise to Power – OPV‐Based Solar Parks,"A solar park based on polymer solar cells is described and analyzed with respect to performance, practicality, installation speed, and energy payback time. It is found that a high voltage installation where solar cells are all printed in series enables an installation rate in Watts installed per minute that far exceed any other PV technology in existence. The energy payback time for the practical installation of polymer solar cell foil on a wooden 250 square meter platform in its present form is 277 days when operated in Denmark and 180 days when operated in southern Spain. The installation and de‐installation rate is above 100 m min−1, which, with the present performance and web width, implies installation of >200 W min−1. In comparison, this also exceeds the overall manufacturing speed of the polymer solar cell foil with a width of 305 mm which is currently 1 m min−1 for complete encapsulated and tested foil. It is also significant that simultaneous installation and de‐installation which enables efficient schemes for decommissioning and recycling is possible. It is highlighted where research efforts should most rationally be invested in order to make grid electricity from OPV a reality (and it is within reach)."
16,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.2838438,2018,Multistress Testing of OPV Modules for Accurate Predictive Aging and Reliability Predictions,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) degradation remains a complex challenge and previous studies have shown the degradation to be a function of multiple stresses, so it can be inaccurate to predict failure rates using single stress tests. In this paper, a new testing methodology whereby multiple stresses are applied simultaneously using a “design of experiment (DOE) approach” is reported and used for predictive aging of modules. Multistress data are used for predictive aging of OPV modules under different stress levels; a general log-linear life model has been adapted and applied in order to predict the life of OPV modules and this is compared to experimental data, which show that a close estimation of simulated lifetime is obtained (within 18% accuracy). The life test models can be used for predicting aging of OPV modules in different geographic locations and could be used to account for different degradation rates due to seasonal climatic variations. Furthermore, by using the DOE data, we show how the major stress factors can be screened and their statistical significance upon degradation quantified using analysis of variance. One of the potential benefits of using this approach for OPV degradation studies is that additional factors could be added to study the impact on degradation to provide a more comprehensive study."
17,10.3390/v10100546,2018,"Whole Genome Characterization of Orthopoxvirus (OPV) Abatino, a Zoonotic Virus Representing a Putative Novel Clade of Old World Orthopoxviruses","Orthopoxviruses (OPVs) are diffused over the complete Eurasian continent, but previously described strains are mostly from northern Europe, and few infections have been reported from Italy. Here we present the extended genomic characterization of OPV Abatino, a novel OPV isolated in Italy from an infected Tonkean macaque, with zoonotic potential. Phylogenetic analysis based on 102 conserved OPV genes (core gene set) showed that OPV Abatino is most closely related to the Ectromelia virus species (ECTV), although placed on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, bringing substantial support to the hypothesis that this strain may be part of a novel OPV clade. Extending the analysis to the entire set of genes (coding sequences, CDS) further substantiated this hypothesis. In fact the genome of OPV Abatino included more CDS than ECTV; most of the extra genes (mainly located in the terminal genome regions), showed the highest similarity with cowpox virus (CPXV); however vaccinia virus (VACV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV) were the closest OPV for certain CDS. These findings suggest that OPV Abatino could be the result of complex evolutionary events, diverging from any other previously described OPV, and may indicate that previously reported cases in Italy could represent the tip of the iceberg yet to be explored."
18,10.1039/C6TA08593H,2017,Multifunctional ternary additive in bulk heterojunction OPV: increased device performance and stability,"Great improvements in the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have been reported over the years; however, the overall efficiency and operational lifetimes of the devices must be improved. Maintaining a stable power conversion efficiency (PCE) in bulk heterojunction OPV devices can be achieved by utilizing cross-linkable ternary additives that freeze the optimal morphology. However, these additives currently do not contribute to improving the PCE of the device therefore limiting their overall effectiveness. In this study we present a dual functional bis(6-azidohexanoate)silicon phthalocyanine ((HxN3)2-SiPc) with cross-linking groups and near IR absorption as a ternary additive in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) devices. As an additive at 10 wt% with respect to PC61BM, (HxN3)2-SiPc increased the short circuit current density (Jsc) by ≈9% due to increased photocurrent generation in the near IR region. In addition, devices utilizing (HxN3)2-SiPc exhibited a 97% PCE retention after thermal ageing at 150 °C for 23 h (compared to 47% retention for baseline devices) showing the compound is an effective cross-linker. These findings represent the first example of a multifunctional dye additive in an OPV device that simultaneously broadens the spectral coverage, resulting in added photogeneration, and stabilizes the active layer morphology, resulting in increased PCE retention."

20,10.1088/1468-6996/15/3/034203,2014,Recent progress of high performance polymer OLED and OPV materials for organic printed electronics,"Abstract The development of organic printed electronics has been expanding to a variety of applications and is expected to bring innovations to our future life. Along with this trend, high performance organic materials with cost-efficient fabrication processes and specific features such as thin, light weight, bendable, and low power consumption are required. A variety of organic materials have been investigated in the development of this field. The basic guidelines for material design and the recent progress of polymer-based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are reported."
21,10.1039/c5nr00204d,2015,R2R-printed inverted OPV modules--towards arbitrary patterned designs.,"We describe the fabrication of roll-to-roll (R2R) printed organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules using gravure printing and rotary screen-printing processes. These two-dimensional printing techniques are differentiating factors from coated OPVs enabling the direct patterning of arbitrarily shaped and sized features into visual shapes and, increasing the freedom to connect the cells in modules. The inverted OPV structures comprise five layers that are either printed or patterned in an R2R printing process. We examined the rheological properties of the inks used and their relationship with the printability, the compatibility between the processed inks, and the morphology of the R2R-printed layers. We also evaluate the dimensional accuracy of the printed pattern, which is an important consideration in designing arbitrarily-shaped OPV structures. The photoactive layer and top electrode exhibited excellent cross-dimensional accuracy corresponding to the designed width. The transparent electron transport layer extended 300 µm beyond the designed values, whereas the hole transport layer shrank 100 µm. We also examined the repeatability of the R2R fabrication process when the active area of the module varied from 32.2 cm(2) to 96.5 cm(2). A thorough layer-by-layer optimization of the R2R printing processes resulted in realization of R2R-printed 96.5 cm(2) sized modules with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.1% (mean 1.8%) processed with high functionality."
22,10.1002/ENTE.201500150,2015,Roll‐to‐Roll Slot–Die Coated Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) Modules with High Geometrical Fill Factors,"Flexible semi-transparent organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules were manufactured by roll-to-roll slot–die coating of three functional layers [ZnO, photoactive layer, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)] and either the screen printing or inkjet printing of the top electrodes. A poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6] phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) layer deposited from non-chlorinated solvents was used as the absorber layer. The modules were realized by slot–die coating of the layers onto a laser-patterned polyethylene terephthalate/indium-tin oxide (PET/ITO) substrate, followed by laser structuring of all coated layers. The top electrodes were realized by high-resolution printing, which, combined with laser patterning of other layers, enables manufacturing of the modules with high geometrical fill factor (92.5%). The modules have an active area of 156 cm2, and contain 13 serially interconnected cells. Two semitransparent electrodes (ITO from the bottom and PEDOT:PSS/Ag-grid from the top side) allow the absorption of photons incident from both sides. The performance of the modules was evaluated and compared among the modules by considering the following factors: (i) roll-to-roll slot–die coated vs. spin-coated layers,(ii) inkjet-printed vs. screen-printed top electrodes, (iii) top vs. bottom illumination. The demonstrated technology is one of the proven feasible ways towards industrial manufacturing of the OPV modules."
23,10.3762/bjoc.12.223,2016,High performance p-type molecular electron donors for OPV applications via alkylthiophene catenation chromophore extension,"The synthesis of key 4-alkyl-substituted 5-(trimethylsilyl)thiophene-2-boronic acid pinacol esters 3 allowed a simplified alkylthiophene catenation process to access bis-, ter-, quater-, and quinquethiophene π-bridges for the synthesis of acceptor–π-bridge-donor– π-bridge-acceptor (A–π-D–π-A) electron donor molecules. Based on the known benzodithiophene-terthiophene-rhodanine (BTR) material, the BXR series of materials, BMR (X = M, monothiophene), BBR (X = B, bithiophene), known BTR (X = T, terthiophene), BQR (X = Q, quaterthiophene), and BPR (X = P(penta), quinquethiophene) were synthesised to examine the influence of chromophore extension on the device performance and stability for OPV applications. The BTxR (x = 4, butyl, and x = 8, octyl) series of materials were synthesised by varying the oligothiophene π-bridge alkyl substituent to examine structure–property relationships in OPV device performance. The devices assembled using electron donors with an extended chromophore (BQR and BPR) are shown to be more thermally stable than the BTR containing devices, with un-optimized efficiencies up to 9.0% PCE.

The polymer and small molecule were complexed with pyridine functionalized perylene bisimide (UPBIPy) and the properties of the donor: acceptor (D:A) complexes were compared. Both polymer and small molecule D:A complexes formed lamellar morphologies in the <10 nm length scale, which could be visualized by TEM and AFM imaging. The flexibility of the segmented polymer architecture imparted special properties to the polymer and its complex. The polymer complex (POPVC) exhibited white light emission with CIE color coordinates (0.27, 0.32) due to partial energy transfer from POPV to UPBIPy. The analogous model OPV complex (SOPVC) continued to show characteristic blue OPV emission in the complex also. The higher sensitivity of polymers toward temperature was made use of to tune the emission color in the complex from white (0.27, 0.32) at 30 ..."
25,10.1002/14651858.CD011260.PUB2,2014,Sequential inactivated (IPV) and live oral (OPV) poliovirus vaccines for preventing poliomyelitis.,"BACKGROUND
Poliomyelitis mainly affects unvaccinated children under five years of age, causing irreversible paralysis or even death. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live attenuated virus, which can, in rare cases, cause a paralysis known as vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP), and also vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) due to acquired neurovirulence after prolonged duration of replication. The incidence of poliomyelitis caused by wild polio virus (WPV) has declined dramatically since the introduction of OPV and later the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), however, the cases of paralysis linked to the OPV are currently more frequent than those related to the WPV. Therefore, in 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended at least one IPV dose preceding routine immunisation with OPV to reduce VAPPs and VDPVs until polio could be eradicated.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of sequential IPV-OPV immunisation schemes compared to either OPV or IPV alone.


SEARCH METHODS
In May 2019 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 14 other databases, three trials registers and reports of adverse effects on four web sites. We also searched the references of identified studies, relevant reviews and contacted authors to identify additional references.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, controlled before-after studies, nationwide uncontrolled before-after studies (UBAs), interrupted time series (ITS) and controlled ITS comparing sequential IPV-OPV schedules (one or more IPV doses followed by one or more OPV doses) with IPV alone, OPV alone or non-sequential IPV-OPV combinations.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 21 studies: 16 RCTs involving 6407 healthy infants (age range 96 to 975 days, mean 382 days), one ITS with 28,330 infants and four nationwide studies (two ITS, two UBA). Ten RCTs were conducted in high-income countries; five in the USA, two in the UK, and one each in Chile, Israel, and Oman. The remaining six RCTs were conducted in middle-income countries; China, Bangladesh, Guatemala, India, and Thailand. We rated all included RCTs at low or unclear risk of bias for randomisation domains, most at high or unclear risk of attrition bias, and half at high or unclear risk for conflict of interests. Almost all RCTs were at low risk for the remaining domains. ITSs and UBAs were mainly considered at low risk of bias for most domains. IPV-OPV versus OPV It is uncertain if an IPV followed by OPV schedule is better than OPV alone at reducing the number of WPV cases (very low-certainty evidence); however, it may reduce VAPP cases by 54% to 100% (three nationwide studies; low-certainty evidence). There is little or no difference in vaccination coverage between IPV-OPV and OPV-only schedules (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.06; 1 ITS study; low-certainty evidence). Similarly, there is little or no difference between the two schedule types for the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.70; 4 studies, 1948 participants; low-certainty evidence); or the number of people with protective humoral response P1 (moderate-certainty evidence), P2 (for the most studied schedule; two IPV doses followed by OPV; low-certainty evidence), and P3 (low-certainty evidence). Two IPV doses followed by bivalent OPV (IIbO) may reduce P2 neutralising antibodies compared to trivalent OPV (moderate-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to P1 or P2 neutralising antibodies following an IIO schedule or OPV alone (low-certainty evidence). Both IIO and IIbO schedules may increase P3 neutralising antibodies compared to OPV (moderate-certainty evidence). It may also lead to lower mucosal immunity given increased faecal excretion of P1 (low-certainty evidence), P2 and P3 (moderate-certainty evidence) after OPV challenge. IPV-OPV versus IPV It is uncertain if IPV-OPV is more effective than IPV alone at reducing the number of WPV cases (very low-certainty evidence). There were no data regarding VAPP cases. There is no clear evidence of a difference between IPV-OPV and OPV schedules for the number of people with protective humoral response (low- and moderate-certainty evidence). IPV-OPV schedules may increase mean titres of P1 neutralising antibodies compared to OPV alone (low- and moderate-certainty evidence), but the effect on P2 and P3 titres is not clear (very low- and moderate-certainty evidence). IPV-OPV probably reduces the number of people with P3 poliovirus faecal excretion after OPV challenge with IIO and IIOO sequences (moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce the number with P2 (low-certainty evidence), but not with P1 (very low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the schedules in number of SAEs (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.43; 2 studies, 1063 participants, low-certainty evidence). The number of persons with P2 protective humoral immunity and P2 neutralising antibodies are probably lower with most sequential schemes without P2 components (i.e. bOPV) than with trivalent OPV or IVP alone (moderate-certainty evidence). IPV (3)-OPV versus IPV (2)-OPV One study (137 participants) showed no clear evidence of a difference between three IPV doses followed by OPV and two IPV doses followed by OPV, on the number of people with P1 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03), P2 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03), or P3 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05) protective humoral and intestinal immunity; all moderate-certainty evidence. This study did not report on any other outcomes.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
IPV-OPV compared to OPV may reduce VAPPs without affecting vaccination coverage, safety or humoral response, except P2 with sequential schemes without P2 components, but increase poliovirus faecal excretion after OPV challenge for some polio serotypes. Compared to IPV-only schedules, IPV-OPV may have little or no difference on SAEs, probably has little or no effect on persons with protective humoral response, may increase neutralising antibodies, and probably reduces faecal excretion after OPV challenge of certain polio serotypes. Using three IPV doses as part of a IPV-OPV schedule does not appear to be better than two IPV doses for protective humoral response. Sequential schedules during the transition from OPV to IPV-only immunisation schedules seems a reasonable option aligned with current WHO recommendations. Findings could help decision-makers to optimise polio vaccination policies, reducing inequities between countries."
26,10.1039/C3TC31245C,2013,"Directly probing the molecular order of conjugated polymer in OPV blends induced by different film thicknesses, substrates and additives","In organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic (OPV) devices, formation of a phase-separated morphology of the blend thin film with a high degree of molecular order is required for efficient device performance. Using resonant Raman spectroscopy we monitor in situ the P3HT molecular order in P3HT:PCBM blend films influenced by the substrate, film thickness and additives. We report that molecular order depends on substrate for as-cast films, consistent with vertical phase separation driven by a surface energy gradient, but is standardised to a highly ordered state by thermal annealing. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals this phase transition to a more ordered state begins at 40–60 °C for ∼120 nm thick blend films, which corresponds to the glass transition temperature (Tg). Ultra-thin (<10 nm thick) blend films had greater P3HT order than the bulk and reorganised at lower temperatures, which we propose is due to a P3HT-rich interfacial layer at the film/air interface, and that extra disordered component retained despite annealing is due to P3HT trapped in a disordered state within the corresponding PCBM-rich substrate interface. Finally we probe how the 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) additive improves P3HT molecular order in blends by increasing phase separation during deposition, finding that 3% ODT by volume presents a saturation point for improving molecular order, and the improvement is comparable to that by thermal annealing. Through in situ experiments and varied fabrication conditions, we have built an understanding of how processing conditions determine conjugated polymer molecular order in blends, with the aim of controlling morphology for higher OPV efficiencies."

An 82-d-old infant developed purpura at the same day after the second dose of oral polio vaccine. Until the time of hospital admission, the male infant had been in good health and had not received any drugs, and the possible causes of this condition were excluded. His platelet count was 13 × 109/L. Platelet-associated IgG was elevated, but the amount of megakaryocytes in bone marrow aspirates was within the normal range, suggesting immune mechanism-associated thrombocytopenia. The infant recovered with the proper treatment within 30 d. Attention should be paid to OPV-associated thrombocytopenia, though it seems to be less frequent than after natural infections."

The lamp comprised the polymer solar cell together with printed circuitry, discrete components and flexible lithium polymer batteries. The number of discrete steps required for the manufacture of the lamp was 35 and more than 10 000 units of the demonstrator was manufactured. We describe the efforts towards increasing the technical yield which was 89% overall and discuss the compromises that had to be made to achieve the high technical yield for a process that was as automated as possible. All the steps in the preparation of the solar cell, the circuitry and the overlays were performed using full roll-to-roll methods. The mounting of the discrete components, such as LED, diode and Zener diode, was performed in sheets of 15 units using a fully automated SMD mounting machine. The mounting of the batteries, contacts and final testing was done manually. The lamination into the final lamp and the final laser cutting into the discrete lamps were performed using automated systems."
29,10.1021/ac9026109,2010,"A planar, chip-based, dual-beam refractometer using an integrated organic light-emitting diode (OLED) light source and organic photovoltaic (OPV) detectors.","We present a simple chip-based refractometer with a central organic light-emitting diode (OLED) light source and two opposed organic photovoltaic (OPV) detectors on an internal reflection element (IRE) substrate, creating a true dual-beam sensor platform. For first-generation platforms, we demonstrate the use of a single heterojunction OLED based on electroluminescence from an Alq(3)/TPD heterojunction (tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum/N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine) and light detection with planar heterojunction pentacene/C(60) OPVs. The sensor utilizes the considerable fraction of emitted light from conventional thin-film OLEDs that is coupled into guided modes in the IRE, instead of into the forward (display) direction. A ray-optics description is used to describe light throughput and efficiency-limiting factors for light coupling from the OLED into the substrate modes, light traversing through the IRE substrate, and light coupling into the OPV detectors. The arrangement of the OLED at the center of the chip provides for two sensing regions: a ""sample"" channel and a ""reference"" channel, with detection of light by independent OPV detectors. This configuration allows for normalization of the sensor response against fluctuations in OLED light output, stability, and local fluctuations (temperature) that might influence sensor response. The dual-beam configuration permits significantly enhanced sensitivity to refractive index changes, relative to single-beam protocols, and is easily integrated into a field-portable instrumentation package. Changes in refractive index (DeltaRI) between 10(-2) and 10(-3) RI units could be detected for single beam operation, with sensitivity increased to DeltaRI approximately 10(-4) RI units when the dual-beam configuration is employed."

The OPV side chains were equipped with gallic acid moieties in order to promote the formation of a helical conformation in poor solvents. The polymers were prepared by Stille-couplings and characterized by GPC and NMR, UV−vis, CD, and emission spectroscopy. It was found that OPV−PDTPs, solely equipped with (chiral) alkyl groups at the terminal gallic acid group, show a very strong tendency to adopt a helical conformation, but no resolution of the mixture of helices and therefore no chiral expression. Additional substitution of the OPV allows for a discrimination of the mixture of helical senses. In this way, the OPV side chains can be chirally organized by the helical PDTP backbone. Substitution of the OPV in α-position, however, sterically excludes the possibility to a..."
31,10.1586/erv.10.39,2010,Switching from OPV to IPV: are we behind the schedule in Latin America?,"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been an effective strategy since it was initiated almost five decades ago. However, concern regarding its collateral effects has been increasing in recent years among the scientific and policymaker community, since it has proved to be of risk for immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals by causing cases and even outbreaks of poliomyelitis disease in countries where the virus is not circulating. Enhanced-potency inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), a safer, effective and inexpensive vaccine, has been available for the past couple of decades. Different points of view have emerged regarding stopping the use of OPV to start routine general IPV but, despite the evidence of OPVs derived and associated with unnecessary poliomyelitis cases, Central and South America are still lacking a strategy in place to make the switch from OPV to IPV, and there are no leading efforts to start this strategy. This review gives some evidence-based elements to help raise criteria regarding the best vaccine to choose and highlights the current need for strategic planning in Latin America to avoid more vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis cases."
32,,2008,The case for cooperation in managing and maintaining the end of poliomyelitis: stockpile needs and coordinated OPV cessation.,"CONTEXT
Achieving successful eradication of a disease requires global cooperation to obtain a shared goal. Coordination of the endgame may seem an obvious requirement for success, but that does not ensure that cooperation will occur.


OBJECTIVE
To analytically explore the need for cooperation to maintain global polio eradication specifically related to creation of a global polio vaccine stockpile and coordination of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation.


DESIGN
Using risk and decision analysis and game theoretical concepts, we modeled the importance of global cooperation in managing the risks associated with polioviruses for a time horizon of 20 years after successful global disruption of circulation of wild polioviruses.


RESULTS
Countries may wish to avoid the financial costs of vaccination and risks for vaccine-associated paralytic polio following eradication of wild polioviruses, which may lead them to reduce their use of OPV. However, reducing or stopping vaccination too soon and without coordination poses serious risks, including the possibility of reimportation of wild polioviruses and the possibility of vaccine-derived polioviruses. Analysis of the risks for potential outbreaks suggests the need for creation and maintenance of a global stockpile of vaccine for outbreak response. Game theoretical considerations show that coordination of OPV cessation optimizes expected costs and risks globally, despite the potential perceived incentives for countries to stop OPV earlier or later than other countries, or to continue OPV use indefinitely.


CONCLUSIONS
This article makes the strong case for global cooperation on risk management and suggests that even though individual countries may perceive their own risks as small, risks at the global level warrant cooperative action and coordination of OPV cessation."
33,10.1002/adma.202300400,2023,Compromising Charge Generation and Recombination of Organic Photovoltaics with Mixed Diluent Strategy for Certified 19.4% Efficiency,"The ternary blend is demonstrated as an effective strategy to promote the device performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) due to the dilution effect. While the compromise between the charge generation and recombination remains a challenge. Here, a mixed diluent strategy for further improving the device efficiency of OPV is proposed. Specifically, the high‐performance OPV system with a polymer donor, i.e., PM6, and a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), i.e., BTP‐eC9, is diluted by the mixed diluents, which involve a high bandgap NFA of BTP‐S17 and a low bandgap NFA of BTP‐S16 (similar with that of the BTP‐eC9). The BTP‐S17 of better miscibility with BTP‐eC9 can dramatically enhance the open‐circuit voltage (VOC), while the BTP‐S16 maximizes the charge generation or the short‐circuit current density (JSC). The interplay of BTP‐17 and BTP‐S16 enables better compromise between charge generation and recombination, thus leading to a high device performance of 19.76% (certified 19.41%), which is the best among single‐junction OPVs. Further analysis on carrier dynamics validates the efficacy of mixed diluents for balancing charge generation and recombination, which can be further attributed to the more diverse energetic landscapes and improved morphology. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for high‐performance OPV for further commercialization."
34,10.1002/RMV.401,2003,Polio eradication: the OPV paradox,"Routine and mass administration of oral polio vaccine (OPV) since 1961 has prevented many millions of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. The public health value of this inexpensive and easily administered product has been extraordinary. Progress of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has further defined the value of OPV as well as its risk through vaccine‐associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and vaccine‐derived polioviruses (VDPV). Although both are rare, once wild poliovirus transmission has been interrupted by OPV, the only poliomyelitis due to poliovirus will be caused by OPV. Poliovirus will be eradicated only when OPV use is discontinued. This paradox provides a major incentive for eventually stopping polio immunization or replacing OPV, but it also introduces complexity into the process of identifying safe and scientifically sound strategies for doing so. The core post eradication immunization issues include the risk/benefits of continued OPV use, the extent of OPV replacement with IPV, possible strategies for discontinuing OPV, and the potential for development and licensure of a safe and effective replacement for OPV. Formulation of an informed post eradication immunization policy requires careful evaluation of polio epidemiology, surveillance capability, vaccine availability, laboratory containment, and the risks posed by the very tool responsible for successful interruption of wild poliovirus transmission.

In this study, a multiscale fibril network morphology in a PBQx‐TCl:PBDB‐TF:eC9‐2Cl‐based system is constructed by regulating donor and acceptor phase‐transition kinetics. The distinctive phase‐transition process and crystal size are systematically investigated. PBQx‐TCl and eC9‐2Cl form fibril structures with diameters of ≈25 nm in ternary films. Additionally, fine fibrils assembled by PBDB‐TF are uniformly distributed over the fibril networks of PBQx‐TCl and eC9‐2Cl. The ideal multiscale fibril network morphology enables the ternary system to achieve superior charge transfer and transport processes compared to binary systems; these improvements promote enhanced photon utilization efficiency. Finally, a high power conversion efficiency of 19.51% in a single‐junction OPV cell is achieved. The external quantum efficiency of the optimized ternary cell exceeds 85% over a wide range of 500–800 nm. A tandem OPV cell is also fabricated to increase solar photon absorption. The tandem cell has an excellent PCE of more than 20%. This study provides guidance for constructing an ideal multiscale fibril network morphology and improving the photon utilization efficiency of OPV cells."
36,10.1002/CHEM.200305447,2004,Extension of conjugation leading to bathochromic or hypsochromic effects in OPV series.,"Four OPV series 1-4 (a-d) with a terminal dialkylamino group as electron donor were prepared by Wittig-Horner reactions. To study the influence of the push-pull effect on the long-wavelength absorption, three of the four series contained terminal acceptor groups (CN, CHO, NO(2)). The length of the chromophores strongly affects the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)-an effect which superimposes upon the extension of the conjugation. Increasing numbers n of repeat units cause an overall bathochromic shift for the purely donor-substituted series 1 a-4 a and the series 1 b-4 b with CN as weak acceptor. The two effects annihilate each other in the series 1 c-4 c with terminal CHO groups, so that the absorption maxima are almost independent of the length of the chromophore. A hypsochromic shift is observed for the series 1 d-4 d, which contains the strong acceptor group NO(2). This anomaly disappears on protonation of the dialkylamino group because the push-pull effect disappears in the ammonium salts. The results can be explained by semiempirical quantum mechanics (AM1, INDO/S). The HOMO-LUMO transition, which is mainly responsible for the ICT, becomes less important in the electron transitions S(0)-->S(1) when the distance between donor and acceptor is increased. The commonly used VB model, which contains an electroneutral and a zwitterionic resonance structure, is contrasted with a MO model with dipole segments at both ends of the OPV chains. The latter model turned out to be more appropriate-at least for donor-acceptor-substituted OPVs with n >/= 2."
37,10.1002/ADMA.200501717,2006,Design Rules for Donors in Bulk‐Heterojunction Solar Cells—Towards 10 % Energy‐Conversion Efficiency,"There has been an intensive search for cost-effective photovoltaics since the development of the first solar cells in the 1950s. [1–3] Among all alternative technologies to silicon-based pn-junction solar cells, organic solar cells could lead the most significant cost reduction. [4] The field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) comprises organic/inorganic nanostructures like dyesensitized solar cells, multilayers of small organic molecules, and phase-separated mixtures of organic materials (the bulkheterojunction solar cell). A review of several OPV technologies has been presented recently. [5] Light absorption in organic solar cells leads to the generation of excited, bound electron– hole pairs (often called excitons). To achieve substantial energy-conversion efficiencies, these excited electron–hole pairs need to be dissociated into free charge carriers with a high yield. Excitons can be dissociated at interfaces of materials with different electron affinities or by electric fields, or the dissociation can be trap or impurity assisted. Blending conjugated polymers with high-electron-affinity molecules like C60 (as in the bulk-heterojunction solar cell) has proven to be an efficient way for rapid exciton dissociation. Conjugated polymer–C60 interpenetrating networks exhibit ultrafast charge transfer (∼40 fs). [6,7] As there is no competing decay process of the optically excited electron–hole pair located on the polymer in this time regime, an optimized mixture with C60 converts absorbed photons to electrons with an efficiency close to 100%. [8] The associated bicontinuous interpenetrating network enables efficient collection of the separated charges at the electrodes. The bulk-heterojunction solar cell has attracted a lot of attention because of its potential to be a true low-cost photovoltaic technology. A simple coating or printing process would enable roll-to-roll manufacturing of flexible, low-weight PV modules, which should permit cost-efficient production and the development of products for new markets, e.g., in the field of portable electronics. One major obstacle for the commercialization of bulk-heterojunction solar cells is the relatively small device efficiencies that have been demonstrated up to now. [5] The best energy-conversion efficiencies published for small-area devices approach 5%. [9–11] A detailed analysis of state-of-the-art bulk-heterojunction solar cells [8] reveals that the efficiency is limited by the low opencircuit voltage (Voc) delivered by these devices under illumination. Typically, organic semiconductors with a bandgap of about 2 eV are applied as photoactive materials, but the observed open-circuit voltages are only in the range of 0.5–1 V. There has long been a controversy about the origin of the Voc in conjugated polymer–fullerene solar cells. Following the classical thin-film solar-cell concept, the metal–insulator–metal (MIM) model was applied to bulk-heterojunction devices. In the MIM picture, Voc is simply equal to the work-function difference of the two metal electrodes. The model had to be modified after the observation of the strong influence of the reduction potential of the fullerene on the open-circuit volt"

The hybrid compound 8 has been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and its magnetic and luminescent properties have been investigated as a function of temperature. The structure consists of the stacking of ferromagnetic Ni(II) based layers at ca. 29 A apart. A ferromagnetic 3D order occurs at TC = 9.5 K. The study of the temperature dependence of the luminescent properties of the OPV-based hybrid compound shows that the π electron sub-system is influenced by the magnetic ordering of the Ni(II) sub-network.
39,10.1021/JA063405D,2006,Chiral alignment of OPV chromophores: exploitation of the ureidophthalimide-based foldamer.,"The ability of foldamers to adopt a secondary structure in solution has been exploited to organize peripheral functionality. Our previously reported poly(ureidophthalimide) foldamer proved to be an excellent scaffold for the chiral organization of peripherally positioned oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) chromophores. Facile high-yielding synthesis gave access to the required OPV-decorated building blocks. A condensation polymerization provided polymers of sufficient length to allow construction of a helical architecture comprising several turns. Short and long chains were separated by chromatography. Circular dichroism studies in THF of the longer chains indicate the presence of helically arranged OPVs. However, such an effect is not observed in CHCl3. Remarkable are the measurements of the OPV foldamers in heptane. A bisignate Cotton effect is observed in heptane of a sample with a THF history. No Cotton effect is observed in heptane of a sample with a CHCl3 history. In this example of supramolecular synthesis, the solvent dictates the expression of supramolecular chirality in a secondary structure. The short-chain oligomeric fractions that are unable to create a full turn revealed on scanning tunneling microscopy analysis the presence of circular architectures at the graphite/1-phenyloctane interface. This is in full agreement with the proposed conformation of the decorated foldamers."

Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single‐junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide‐bandgap polymer donor named PBQx‐TF and a new low‐bandgap non‐fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9‐2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F‐BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open‐circuit voltage of 0.879 V, short‐circuit current density of 26.7 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high‐performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers."
42,10.1002/adma.200903528,2010,For the Bright Future—Bulk Heterojunction Polymer Solar Cells with Power Conversion Efficiency of 7.4%,"Sun is the largest carbon-neutral energy source that has not been fully utilized. Although there are solar cell devices based on inorganic semiconductor to efficiently harvest solar energy, the cost of these conventional devices is too high to be economically viable. This is the major motivation for the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials and devices, which are envisioned to exhibit advantages such as low cost, flexibility, and abundant availability. [1] The past success in organic light-emitting diodes provides scientists with confidence that organic photovoltaic devices will be a vital alternate to the inorganic counterpart. At the heart of the OPV technology advantage is the easiness of the fabrication, which holds the promise of very low-cost manufacturing process. A simple, yet successful technique is the solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell composed of electron-donating semiconducting polymers and electron-withdrawing fullerides as active layers. [2] The composite active layer can be prepared as a large area in a single step by using techniques such as spin-coating, inkjet-printing, spraycoating, gravure-coating, roller-casting etc. [3] In the last fifteen years, a significant progress has been made on the improvement of the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer BHJ solar cells, and the achieved efficiencies have evolved from less than 1% in the poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) system in 1995, [2] to 4‐5% in the poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT) system in 2005, [4] to around 6%, as reported recently. [5] However, the efficiency of polymer solar cells is still significantly lower than their inorganic counterparts, such as silicon, CdTe and CIGS, which prevents practical applications in large scale."

The extension of the conjugation leads to a bathochromic effect that shifts the absorption from the UV into the visible region. The carbinol series has a convergence limit of the absorption at λmax = 415 nm. The corresponding carbenium ions exhibit a stronger bathochromic shift with the increasing number of repeating units in each chain. Thus, NIR dyes were obtained which show a convergence limit at λmax = 879 nm. The charge distribution in the ground state of the carbocations is discussed on the basis of 13C NMR spectroscopic data."

A key component of this goal is to minimize the risk of reintroduction by destruction of polioviruses except in an absolute minimum number of facilities that serve essential functions and implement effective containment. Effective containment begins with a complete facility risk assessment. This article focuses on characterizing the risks of exposure to polioviruses from the essential vaccine production, quality control, and international reference and research facilities that remain. We consider the potential exposure pathways that might lead to a poliovirus reintroduction, including para‐occupational exposures and releases to the environment, and review the literature to provide available estimates and a qualitative assessment of containment risks. Minimizing the risk of poliovirus transmission from a poliovirus facility to increasingly susceptible communities is a crucial and ongoing effort requiring understanding and actively managing the potential exposure pathways."

46,10.1002/adma.201908205,2020,Single‐Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cells with Approaching 18% Efficiency,"Optimizing the molecular structures of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials is one of the most effective methods to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). For an excellent molecular system with a certain conjugated skeleton, fine tuning the alky chains is of considerable significance to fully explore its photovoltaic potential. In this work, the optimization of alkyl chains is performed on a chlorinated nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) named BTP‐4Cl‐BO (a Y6 derivative) and very impressive photovoltaic parameters in OPV cells are obtained. To get more ordered intermolecular packing, the n‐undecyl is shortened at the edge of BTP‐eC11 to n‐nonyl and n‐heptyl. As a result, the NFAs of BTP‐eC9 and BTP‐eC7 are synthesized. The BTP‐eC7 shows relatively poor solubility and thus limits its application in device fabrication. Fortunately, the BTP‐eC9 possesses good solubility and, at the same time, enhanced electron transport property than BTP‐eC11. Significantly, due to the simultaneously enhanced short‐circuit current density and fill factor, the BTP‐eC9‐based single‐junction OPV cells record a maximum PCE of 17.8% and get a certified value of 17.3%. These results demonstrate that minimizing the alkyl chains to get suitable solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing has a great potential in further improving its photovoltaic performance."

However, the polymer donors suitable for all‐polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM‐Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM‐Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well‐used polymer acceptor, PY‐IT, the PQM‐Cl‐based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all‐polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM‐Cl‐based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM‐Cl‐based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM‐Cl is a potential candidate for all‐polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high‐efficient all‐polymer OPV cells."

These unique properties have led to the performance enhancement of several types of devices and to a variety of novel applications.

Energetics in general play a key role in advancing device structure and performance in organic electronics; however, the literature provides a very inconsistent picture of the electronic structure of TMOs and the resulting interpretation of their role as functional constituents in organic electronics. With this review we intend to clarify some of the existing misconceptions. An overview of TMO‐based device architectures ranging from transparent OLEDs to tandem OPV cells is also given. Various TMO film deposition methods are reviewed, addressing vacuum evaporation and recent approaches for solution‐based processing.

53,,1994,"Successful control of poliomyelitis by a combined OPV/IPV polio vaccine program in the West Bank and Gaza, 1978-93.","In the 1970s the incidence of poliomyelitis in Gaza and the West Bank was high, even among children immunized with as many as four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). This was thought to be due to interference in uptake from other enteroviruses in the environment. A combined program of OPV and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was instituted in these areas in 1978, and the incidence of polio declined dramatically. Wild poliovirus findings in sewage in 1990-91 coupled with two outbreaks of polio, one in Israel in 1988 and another in Jordan in 1992, were reminders that the area should still be considered endemic. The potential of fresh entry of wild poliovirus may occur via persons who may have personal protection but may still shed the virus due to inadequate enteric immunity. In addition, the combined program protects against vaccine-associated poliomyelitis. A similar modified combined OPV/IPV program has been adopted in Israel. The combination of OPV and IPV provides an important alternative strategy in the worldwide effort to eradicate poliomyelitis."
54,10.1002/aenm.202201076,2022,Manipulating Charge Transfer and Transport via Intermediary Electron Acceptor Channels Enables 19.3% Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics,"Balancing and improving the open‐circuit voltage (Voc) and short‐circuit current density (Jsc) synergistically has always been the critical point for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to achieve high efficiencies. Here, this work adopts a ternary strategy to regulate the trade‐off between Voc and Jsc by combining the symmetric‐asymmetric non‐fullerene acceptors that differ at terminals and alkyl side chains to build the ternary OPV (TOPV). It is noticed that the reduced energy disorder and the enhanced luminescence efficiency of TOPV enable a mitigated energy loss and a higher Voc. Meanwhile, the third component, which is distributed at the host donor–acceptor interface, acts as the charge transport channel. The prolonged exciton lifetime, the boosted charge mobility, and the depressed charge recombination promote the TOPV to obtain an improved Jsc. Finally, with synergistically improved Voc and Jsc, the TOPV delivers an optimal efficiency of 19.26% (certified as 19.12%), representing one of the highest values reported so far."

The results obtained during these trials contributed greatly to the general acceptance of OPV as a safe and efficient preparation. Mechanisms responsible for the attenuated phenotype of the Sabin strains have long been studied in Russia. For the first time, recombination analysis was used for mapping genetic determinants of attenuation, which were found to reside largely in the 5' half of the Sabin strains RNA. It has been established that the phenotype effect of a subset of the major attenuating mutations is due to the impairment of the translation initiation."
56,10.3109/00365549409008643,1994,Comparison of enhanced potency inactivated poliovirus vaccine (EIPV) versus standard oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in Thai infants.,"Enhanced potency inactivated poliovirus vaccine (EIPV), combined with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, was compared with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) regarding immunogenicity in Thai infants, vaccinated at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. EIPV induced significantly higher seroconversion rates than OPV to all 3 poliovirus types after the second and third immunization. After 3 doses of each vaccine, at 7 months of age, all infants receiving EIPV proved seropositive for poliovirus type 1, type 2 and type 3 neutralizing antibodies, whereas of those receiving OPV, 9% remained seronegative (titre < 1:4) for type 1 (p = 0.0042) and 11% for type 3 (p = 0.0013). All participating children were given an additional dose of OPV at the age of 9 months and tested again at 12 months of age. At that point, virtually all infants had poliovirus neutralizing antibodies, but the geometric mean titres to each poliovirus type were significantly higher in the vaccinees who had received EIPV. It is concluded that the greater immunogenicity of EIPV vis-à-vis 3 doses of OPV may be biologically significant for protection against poliovirus types 1 and 3 in countries where cases of poliomyelitis occur in young children. These findings warrant considering EIPV, alone or in combination with OPV, for an immunization programme in Thailand and similar countries in the future."
57,10.1002/adma.202007231,2021,Layer‐by‐Layer Processed Ternary Organic Photovoltaics with Efficiency over 18%,"Obtaining a finely tuned morphology of the active layer to facilitate both charge generation and charge extraction has long been the goal in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here, a solution to resolve the above challenge via synergistically combining the layer‐by‐layer (LbL) procedure and the ternary strategy is proposed and demonstrated. By adding an asymmetric electron acceptor, BTP‐S2, with lower miscibility to the binary donor:acceptor host of PM6:BO‐4Cl, vertical phase distribution can be formed with donor‐enrichment at the anode and acceptor‐enrichment at the cathode in OPV devices during the LbL processing. In contrast, LbL‐type binary OPVs based on PM6:BO‐4Cl still show bulk‐heterojunction like morphology. The formation of the vertical phase distribution can not only reduce charge recombination but also promote charge collection, thus enhancing the photocurrent and fill factor in LbL‐type ternary OPVs. Consequently, LbL‐type ternary OPVs exhibit the best efficiency of 18.16% (certified: 17.8%), which is among the highest values reported to date for OPVs. The work provides a facile and effective approach for achieving high‐efficiency OPVs with expected morphologies, and demonstrates the LbL‐type ternary strategy as being a promising procedure in fabricating OPV devices from the present laboratory study to future industrial production."
58,10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00176,2016,Molecular Design of Benzodithiophene-Based Organic Photovoltaic Materials.,"Advances in the design and application of highly efficient conjugated polymers and small molecules over the past years have enabled the rapid progress in the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology as a promising alternative to conventional solar cells. Among the numerous OPV materials, benzodithiophene (BDT)-based polymers and small molecules have come to the fore in achieving outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) and breaking 10% efficiency barrier in the single junction OPV devices. Remarkably, the OPV device featured by BDT-based polymer has recently demonstrated an impressive PCE of 11.21%, indicating the great potential of this class of materials in commercial photovoltaic applications. In this review, we offered an overview of the organic photovoltaic materials based on BDT from the aspects of backbones, functional groups, alkyl chains, and device performance, trying to provide a guideline about the structure-performance relationship. We believe more exciting BDT-based photovoltaic materials and devices will be developed in the near future."
59,,2001,Anomalous observations on IPV and OPV vaccination.,"Anomalies of vaccine performance are events or observations that go counter to the current paradigms on the properties of a vaccine. In the current paradigm, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) induces serum immunity to protect the individual from poliomyelitis, but not mucosal immunity to prevent subsequent wild poliovirus infection. Therefore, it is believed not to be suitable to interrupt virus transmission in polio-endemic tropical and developing countries, where poliovirus transmission is thought to be predominantly faecal-oral, unlike in countries with excellent sanitation, where it is predominantly respiratory. Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), because it is believed to mimic natural (wild) poliovirus infection and to induce serum and mucosal immunity, is considered ideal to interrupt virus transmission in countries with poor sanitation and endemic polio. Moreover, the vaccine viruses are shed in the stools and it is presumed to spread faeco-orally to unvaccinated children in the vicinity, thus increasing its effectiveness in the community. These paradigms on both vaccines may be seen in standard textbooks of virology and paediatrics. In reality, IPV induces very high mucosal immunity in a monkey model, lasting at least 12 months and providing complete protection against oral challenge with wild virus. In field trials, IPV has been found to have very high vaccine efficacy (VE) and to retard significantly wild-virus transmission in communities. OPV, requiring five to seven doses for individual protection, does not seem to induce effective mucosal immunity. Hence, 10-15 doses of OPV and near 100% vaccination coverage are necessary for interruption of virus transmission in countries with poor sanitation. In the monkey model, wild poliovirus infection did not offer any mucosal protection against a second infection, indicating that live virus infection is not the best way to induce mucosal immunity (unless repeated several times). The immunity induced by OPV has two arms, individual protection (by serum immunity) and mucosal protection from later infection by wild virus; these are dichotomous, as evidenced further by protected children participating in wild virus transmission in breakthrough outbreaks in communities well vaccinated with OPV. There is no evidence that polioviruses, wild or vaccine, spread faeco-orally to any meaningful extent. The median age of polio in India, in the pre-vaccine era, and even in recent years was 12-18 months. No other faeco-oral infection has such a low median age. Measles virus transmission is respiratory, and the median age of measles is over two years. Wild virus is shed faecally, but by the age when faecal microbes infect children, most of them are already immune to disease caused by polioviruses. As for vaccine viruses, even when heavy inocula are fed repeatedly, children may not always become infected. That exposure to the small amounts of virus through faecal contamination (unlike microbes that multiply in food) would infect them, is an unrealistic expectation. There are sufficient anomalies demanding our revision of the old paradigms. IPV is a better immunogen than OPV and is completely safe. During the interval between the cessation of wild virus transmission and the global stoppage of polio vaccination, it will be advantageous to use IPV, particularly combined with DPT vaccine, to provide individual protection, and herd effect to prevent spread in case of the introduction of wild polioviruses, whether unintentionally or otherwise, and to bolster the Expanded Programme on Immunisation."

It is found that the formation of self‐assembled monolayers (SAMs) of [2‐(3,6‐Difluoro‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (F‐2PACz), [2‐(3,6‐Dichloro‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (Cl‐2PACz), [2‐(3,6‐Dibromo‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (Br‐2PACz), and [2‐(3,6‐Diiodo‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (I‐2PACz) directly on indium tin oxide (ITO) increases its work function from 4.73 eV to 5.68, 5.77, 5.82, and 5.73 eV, respectively. Combining these ITO/SAM electrodes with the ternary bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) system PM6:PM7‐Si:BTP‐eC9 yields organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the range of 17.7%–18.5%. OPVs featuring Cl‐2PACz SAMs yield the highest PCE of 18.5%, compared to cells with F‐2PACz (17.7%), Br‐2PACz (18.0%), or I‐2PACz (18.2%). Data analysis reveals that the enhanced performance of Cl‐2PACz‐based OPVs relates to the increased hole mobility, decreased interface resistance, reduced carrier recombination, and longer carrier lifetime. Furthermore, OPVs featuring Cl‐2PACz show enhanced stability under continuous illumination compared to ITO/PEDOT:PSS‐based cells. Remarkably, the introduction of the n‐dopant benzyl viologen into the BHJ further boosted the PCE of the ITO/Cl‐2PACz cells to a maximum value of 18.9%, a record‐breaking value for SAM‐based OPVs and on par with the best‐performing OPVs reported to date."
63,10.1002/adma.202102787,2021,A Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19.6% Efficiency Enabled by Light Distribution Control,"Despite more potential in realizing higher photovoltaic performance, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells still lags behind that of state‐of‐the‐art single‐junction cells. In this work, highly efficient double‐junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB‐TF:ITCC and PBDB‐TF:BTP‐eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx/Ag/ZnO:PFN‐Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine‐tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB‐TF:BTP‐eC11 blend films, the 300 nm‐thick PBDB‐TF:BTP‐eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub‐cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology."
64,10.1093/nsr/nwz200,2019,Organic photovoltaic cell with 17% efficiency and superior processability,"Abstract The development of organic photoactive materials, especially the newly emerging non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs), has enabled rapid progress in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in recent years. Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the top-performance OPV cells have surpassed 16%, the devices are usually fabricated via a spin-coating method and are not suitable for large-area production. Here, we demonstrate that the fine-modification of the flexible side chains of NFAs can yield 17% PCE for OPV cells. More crucially, as the optimal NFA has a suitable solubility and thus a desirable morphology, the high efficiencies of spin-coated devices can be maintained when using scalable blade-coating processing technology. Our results suggest that optimization of the chemical structures of the OPV materials can improve device performance. This has great significance in larger-area production technologies that provide important scientific insights for the commercialization of OPV cells."
65,10.1002/adma.201903441,2019,Eco‐Compatible Solvent‐Processed Organic Photovoltaic Cells with Over 16% Efficiency,"Recent advances in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have enabled the rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. However, this progress is achieved using highly toxic solvents, which are not suitable for the scalable large‐area processing method, becoming one of the biggest factors hindering the mass production and commercial applications of OPVs. Therefore, it is of great importance to get good eco‐compatible processability when designing efficient OPV materials. Here, to achieve high efficiency and good processability of the NFAs in eco‐compatible solvents, the flexible alkyl chains of the highly efficient NFA BTP‐4F‐8 (also known as Y6) are modified and BTP‐4F‐12 is synthesized. Combining with the polymer donor PBDB‐TF, BTP‐4F‐12 shows the best PCE of 16.4%. Importantly, when the polymer donor PBDB‐TF is replaced by T1 with better solubility, various eco‐compatible solvents can be applied to fabricate OPV cells. Finally, over 14% efficiency is obtained with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the processing solvent for 1.07 cm2 OPV cells by the blade‐coating method. These results indicate that the simple modification of the side chain can be used to tune the processability of active layer materials and thus make it more applicable for the mass production with environmentally benign solvents."
66,10.1021/ar400088c,2013,High performance photovoltaic applications using solution-processed small molecules.,"Energy remains a critical issue for the survival and prosperity of humancivilization. Many experts believe that the eventual solution for sustainable energy is the use of direct solar energy as the main energy source. Among the options for renewable energy, photovoltaic technologies that harness solar energy offer a way to harness an unlimited resource and minimum environment impact in contrast with other alternatives such as water, nuclear, and wind energy. Currently, almost all commercial photovoltaic technologies use Si-based technology, which has a number of disadvantages including high cost, lack of flexibility, and the serious environmental impact of the Si industry. Other technologies, such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, can overcome some of these issues. Today, polymer-based OPV (P-OPV) devices have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that exceed 9%. Compared with P-OPV, small molecules based OPV (SM-OPV) offers further advantages, including a defined structure for more reproducible performance, higher mobility and open circuit voltage, and easier synthetic control that leads to more diversified structures. Therefore, while largely undeveloped, SM-OPV is an important emerging technology with performance comparable to P-OPV. In this Account, we summarize our recent results on solution-processed SM-OPV. We believe that solution processing is essential for taking full advantage of OPV technologies. Our work started with the synthesis of oligothiophene derivatives with an acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) structure. Both the backbone conjugation length and electron withdrawing terminal groups play an important role in the light absorption, energy levels and performance of the devices. Among those molecules, devices using a 7-thiophene-unit backbone and a 3-ethylrhodanine (RD) terminal unit produced a 6.1% PCE. With the optimized conjugation length and terminal unit, we borrowed from the results with P-OPV devices to optimize the backbone. Thus we selected BDT (benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene) and DTS (dithienosilole) to replace the central thiophene unit, leading to a PCE of 8.12%. In addition to our molecules, Bazan and co-workers have developed another excellent system using DTS as the core unit that has also achieved a PCE greater than 8%."

Here, a detailed balance strategy is explored to optimize the ST‐OPV via taking both absorption and carrier dynamics into consideration. Based on this principle, comprehensive optimizations are carried out, including a ternary strategy, donor:acceptor blend ratio, thickness, antireflection, etc., to compromise the invisible energy conversion and visible transmission for high‐performance ST‐OPVs. As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST‐OPV shows a remarkably high light‐utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the upscaled device with an area of 1.05 cm2, demonstrating its promise for large‐area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST‐OPVs. Besides, it is demonstrated that the ST‐OPV exhibits good infrared light‐reflection capability for thermal control. This work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon‐to‐electron conversion for high‐performance ST‐OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows."

To address this issue, an asymmetric non‐fullerene acceptor, namely the AC9, is developed and high‐performance OPV with a champion efficiency of 18.43% (18.1% certified) is demonstrated. This represents the record value among binary OPVs. Comprehensive analysis on exciton dissociation, charge collection, carrier transport, and recombination has been carried out, unveiling that the improved device performance of asymmetric AC9‐based OPVs is originated from a better compromise between charge generation and non‐radiative charge recombination, compared with the corresponding symmetric ones. This work provides a high‐performing molecule and paves the way for high‐performance OPVs through asymmetric molecular design."
69,10.1002/adma.202200337,2022,Theory‐Guided Material Design Enabling High‐Performance Multifunctional Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics without Optical Modulations,"Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST‐OPVs) have drawn great attention for promising applications in building‐integrated photovoltaics, providing additional power generation for daily use. A previously proposed strategy, “complementary NIR absorption,” is widely applied for high‐performance ST‐OPVs. However, rational material design toward high performance has not been achieved. In this work, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) model describing this strategy is developed to explore the full potential of material design on ST‐OPV performance. Guided by the model, a novel nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), ATT‐9, is designed and synthesized, which possesses optimal bandgap for ST‐OPVs, achieving a record short‐circuit current density of 30 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 13.40%, the highest value among devices based on NFAs with bandgaps lower than 1.2 eV. It is notworthy that, at such a low bandgap, the energy loss of the device is only 0.58 eV, which is attributed to the low energetic disorder confirmed by an ultralow Urbach energy of 21.6 meV. Benefiting from the optimal bandgap and low energy loss, the ATT‐9‐based ST‐OPV achieves a high light utilization efficiency of 3.33% without optical modulations, and meanwhile shows excellent thermal insulation, exceeding the commercial 3M heat‐insulating window film, demonstrating the outstanding application prospects of multifunctional ST‐OPVs."
70,10.1002/adma.202208926,2022,High‐Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All‐Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology,"All‐polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB‐TF with a high weight‐average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all‐polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high‐Mw PBDB‐TF as a third component into the PBQx‐TF:PY‐IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact π–π stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all‐polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all‐polymer OPV cells."
71,10.1021/jacs.8b12937,2019,14.7% Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Active Materials with a Large Electrostatic Potential Difference.,"Although significant improvements have been achieved for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), the top-performing devices still show power conversion efficiencies far behind those of commercialized solar cells. One of the main reasons is the large driving force required for separating electron-hole pairs. Here, we demonstrate an efficiency of 14.7% in the single-junction OPV by using a new polymer donor PTO2 and a nonfullerene acceptor IT-4F. The device possesses an efficient charge generation at a low driving force. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements probe the formation of loosely bound charge pairs with extended lifetime that impedes the recombination of charge carriers in the blend. The theoretical studies reveal that the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) between PTO2 and IT-4F is large, and the induced intermolecular electric field may assist the charge generation. The results suggest OPVs have the potential for further improvement by judicious modulation of ESP."
72,10.1002/adma.201202873,2013,Factors Limiting Device Efficiency in Organic Photovoltaics,"The power conversion efficiency of the most efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells has recently increased to over 10%. To enable further increases, the factors limiting the device efficiency in OPV must be identified. In this review, the operational mechanism of OPV cells is explained and the detailed balance limit to photovoltaic energy conversion, as developed by Shockley and Queisser, is outlined. The various approaches that have been developed to estimate the maximum practically achievable efficiency in OPV are then discussed, based on empirical knowledge of organic semiconductor materials. Subsequently, approaches made to adapt the detailed balance theory to incorporate some of the fundamentally different processes in organic solar cells that originate from using a combination of two complementary, donor and acceptor, organic semiconductors using thermodynamic and kinetic approaches are described. The more empirical formulations to the efficiency limits provide estimates of 10–12%, but the more fundamental descriptions suggest limits of 20–24% to be reachable in single junctions, similar to the highest efficiencies obtained for crystalline silicon p‐n junction solar cells. Closing this gap sets the stage for future materials research and development of OPV."
73,10.1002/adma.201305999,2014,Molecular Materials for Organic Photovoltaics: Small is Beautiful,"An overview of some recent developments of the chemistry of molecular donor materials for organic photovoltaics (OPV) is presented. Although molecular materials have been used for the fabrication of OPV cells from the very beginning of the field, the design of molecular donors specifically designed for OPV is a relatively recent research area. In the past few years, molecular donors have been used in both vacuum‐deposited and solution‐processed OPV cells and both fields have witnessed impressive progress with power conversion efficiencies crossing the symbolic limit of 10 %. However, this progress has been achieved at the price of an increasing complexity of the chemistry of active materials and of the technology of device fabrication. This evolution probably inherent to the progress of research is difficult to reconcile with the necessity for OPV to demonstrate a decisive economic advantage over existing silicon technology. In this short review various classes of molecular donors are discussed with the aim of defining possible basic molecular structures that can combine structural simplicity, low molecular weight, synthetic accessibility, scalability and that can represent possible starting points for the development of simple and cost‐effective OPV materials."
74,10.1039/B921624C,2010,Interface materials for organic solar cells,"The progress in the development and understanding of interfacial materials for organic photovoltaics (OPV) is reviewed. The proper choice of interface materials is a must for highly efficient and stable OPV devices and has become a significant part of the OPV research today. Interface materials are either non-conducting, semiconducting or conducting layers which not only provide selective contacts for carriers of one sort, but can also determine the polarity of OPV devices, affect the open-circuit voltage, and act as optical spacers or protective layers. In this review both inorganic and organic interface materials are discussed with respect to their function in the OPV device."
75,10.1002/cssc.202100707,2021,18.4% Organic Solar Cells Using a High Ionization Energy Self-Assembled Monolayer as Hole Extraction Interlayer.,"Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) based on Br-2PACz and MeO-2PACz molecules are investigated as hole-extracting interlayers in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies of these SAMs were measured at -6.01 and -5.30 eV for Br-2PACz and MeO-2PACz, respectively, and found to induce significant changes in the work function (WF) of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes upon chemical functionalization. OPV cells based on PM6:BTP-eC9:PC 71 BM using ITO/Br-2PACz anodes exhibit a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4%, outperforming devices with ITO/MeO-2PACz (14.5%) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (17.5%). The higher PCE is found to originate from the much higher WF of ITO/Br-2PACz (-5.81 eV) compared to ITO/MeO-2PACz (4.58 eV) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (4.9 eV), resulting in lower interface resistance, improved hole transport/extraction, lower trap-assisted recombination, and longer carrier lifetimes. Importantly, the ITO/Br-2PACz electrode is chemically stable and after removal of the SAM it can be recycled and reused to construct fresh OPVs with equally impressive performance."
76,10.1021/nn100551j,2010,Solution-processable graphene oxide as an efficient hole transport layer in polymer solar cells.,The utilization of graphene oxide (GO) thin films as the hole transport and electron blocking layer in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is demonstrated. The incorporation of GO deposited from neutral solutions between the photoactive poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer and the transparent and conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) leads to a decrease in recombination of electrons and holes and leakage currents. This results in a dramatic increase in the OPV efficiencies to values that are comparable to devices fabricated with PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer. Our results indicate that GO could be a simple solution-processable alternative to PEDOT:PSS as the effective hole transport and electron blocking layer in OPV and light-emitting diode devices.
77,10.1002/adma.202107330,2021,Near‐Infrared Materials: The Turning Point of Organic Photovoltaics,"Near‐infrared (NIR)‐absorbing organic semiconductors have opened up many exciting opportunities for organic photovoltaic (OPV) research. For example, new chemistries and synthetical methodologies have been developed; especially, the breakthrough Y‐series acceptors, originally invented by our group, specifically Y1, Y3, and Y6, have contributed immensely to boosting single‐junction solar cell efficiency to around 19%; novel device architectures such as tandem and transparent organic photovoltaics have been realized. The concept of NIR donors/acceptors thus becomes a turning point in the OPV field. Here, the development of NIR‐absorbing materials for OPVs is reviewed. According to the low‐energy absorption window, here, NIR photovoltaic materials (p‐type (polymers) and n‐type (fullerene and nonfullerene)) are classified into four categories: 700–800 nm, 800–900 nm, 900–1000 nm, and greater than 1000 nm. Each subsection covers the design, synthesis, and utilization of various types of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. The structure–property relationship between various kinds of D, A units and absorption window are constructed to satisfy requirements for different applications. Subsequently, a variety of applications realized by NIR materials, including transparent OPVs, tandem OPVs, photodetectors, are presented. Finally, challenges and future development of novel NIR materials for the next‐generation organic photovoltaics and beyond are discussed."
78,10.1002/advs.202104742,2022,High‐Efficiency Non‐Fullerene Acceptors Developed by Machine Learning and Quantum Chemistry,"Y6 and its derivatives have greatly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Further developing high‐performance Y6 derivative acceptor materials through the relationship between the chemical structures and properties of these materials will help accelerate the development of OPV. Here, machine learning and quantum chemistry are used to understand the structure–property relationships and develop new OPV acceptor materials. By encoding the molecules with an improved one‐hot code, the trained machine learning model shows good predictive performance, and 22 new acceptors with predicted PCE values greater than 17% within the virtual chemical space are screened out. Trends associated with the discovered high‐performing molecules suggest that Y6 derivatives with medium‐length side chains have higher performance. Further quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the end acceptor units mainly affect the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and the electrostatic potential on molecular surface, which in turn influence the performance of OPV devices. A series of promising Y6 derivative candidates is screened out and a rational design guide for developing high‐performance OPV acceptors is provided. The approach in this work can be extended to other material systems for rapid materials discovery and can provide a framework for designing novel and promising OPV materials."
79,10.1002/aenm.202200275,2022,Over 30% Efficient Indoor Organic Photovoltaics Enabled by Morphological Modification Using Two Compatible Non‐Fullerene Acceptors,"To meet the requirements for indoor organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications, it is imperative to minimize charge recombination loss and enhance photovoltaic performance toward commercially compelling levels. Here, morphological modification in non‐fullerene blends is demonstrated to boost the efficiency and stability of indoor OPVs. For morphological modification, a ternary blend is devised by utilizing two well‐miscible non‐fullerene acceptors, which improve morphological features in the photoactive layer and suppress charge recombination loss. Morphological modification enhances OPV performance, particularly under low‐intensity indoor irradiation conditions, at which trap‐assisted recombination mainly governs the photovoltaic performance. The optimum ternary OPV shows a new record power conversion efficiency of 30.11% at a 500 lux light‐emitting diode, accompanied by excellent morphological durability under thermal stress, despite the use of “existing” photovoltaic materials designed for AM 1.5 G operation. This study elucidates the effects of morphology on OPV performance under low‐light conditions and suggests an ideal morphology for non‐fullerene OPVs with enhanced performance for indoor applications."

The researchers utilized the adapted Turkish version of OPV to collect and used Online Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (OIPA) to analyze the data. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) grounded in EST constructed the theoretical framework for the research. In total, 115 participants completed and consented for the study. Sixteen main facilitator-related themes emerged, and the five most expressed were having technology ( n = 31, 35%), internet ( n = 28, 32%), communication ( n =18, 20%), emotions ( n = 17, 19%), and economic resources ( n = 16, %18). Thirteen main complicators -related themes emerged, and the five most reported barriers were lacks of technological resources ( n = 41, 47%), internet ( n = 40, 46%), appropriate learning environments, learning opportunities ( n = 32, 36%) appropriate resources for online or distance education ( n = 18, 20%), and interaction ( n = 14, 16%). Participants attributed the facilitator and complicators to EST levels respectively as follows: individual/intrapsychic factors (84%; 69%), microsystem (45%; 59%), exosystem (36%; 43%), and macrosystem (34%; 44%). The researchers provided practical recommendations. The researchers obtained an institutional review board approval for this study."
81,10.1021/ja5110602,2015,A rhodanine flanked nonfullerene acceptor for solution-processed organic photovoltaics.,"A novel small molecule, FBR, bearing 3-ethylrhodanine flanking groups was synthesized as a nonfullerene electron acceptor for solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPV). A straightforward synthesis route was employed, offering the potential for large scale preparation of this material. Inverted OPV devices employing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor polymer and FBR as the acceptor gave power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 4.1%. Transient and steady state optical spectroscopies indicated efficient, ultrafast charge generation and efficient photocurrent generation from both donor and acceptor. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate polaron generation efficiency as well as recombination dynamics. It was determined that the P3HT:FBR blend is highly intermixed, leading to increased charge generation relative to comparative devices with P3HT:PC60BM, but also faster recombination due to a nonideal morphology in which, in contrast to P3HT:PC60BM devices, the acceptor does not aggregate enough to create appropriate percolation pathways that prevent fast nongeminate recombination. Despite this nonoptimal morphology the P3HT:FBR devices exhibit better performance than P3HT:PC60BM devices, used as control, demonstrating that this acceptor shows great promise for further optimization."
82,10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00009,2020,Recent Progress in Chlorinated Organic Photovoltaic Materials.,"ConspectusOver the past few years, the development of new materials has contributed to rapid increases in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to over 17%, showing great potential for the commercialization of this technology in the near future. At this stage, designing new materials with superior performance and low cost simultaneously is of crucial importance. Chlorinated materials are emerging as new stars with very high PCEs, creating a molecular design trend to replace the most popular fluorinated materials. For example, by using chlorinated non-fullerene acceptors, we recently got a record PCE of 17% for single-junction OPV cells. Firmly based on recent advances, herein we focus on the topic of chlorinated OPV materials, aiming to provide a guideline for further molecular design.In this Account, first, on the basis of most fundamental features of the Cl atom, we highlight the features of chlorinated materials compared with their fluorinated counterparts: (1) Chlorination is more efficient than fluorination in modulating the optical and electrical properties of OPV materials. In many cases, chlorinated materials show lower energy levels and broader absorption spectra than their fluorinated counterparts, which contribute higher output voltages and current densities in the resulting photovoltaic devices. (2) Cl has a large atomic size than F. On one hand, enhanced overlap of π electrons is beneficial for enhancing the intermolecular packing and crystalline property and thus improving the charge transport. On the other hand, if Cl is introduced inappropriately in the backbone or side chain, this feature will cause a more twisted π plane and larger steric hindrance, having negative impacts on the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding materials. (3) Importantly, chlorination is usually chemically cheaper in synthesis, which has the potential to decrease the material cost of OPV cells. Then, we provide a concise review of chlorinated OPV materials, including polymeric and small-molecule donors and non-fullerene acceptors. The photovoltaic performance in various types of OPV cells using chlorinated materials, such as single-junction, tandem, semitransparent, and indoor-light photovoltaic cells is also discussed. For instance, ultranarrow-band-gap chlorinated acceptors can be used to construct highly efficient color-semitransparent OPV cells, and the wide-band-gap chlorinated materials show great potential for fabricating indoor-light photovoltaic devices. Finally, we briefly discuss current questions related to chlorinated OPV materials and highlight the significance of chlorination in future development."

84,10.1002/adma.201707114,2018,Solvent Additives: Key Morphology‐Directing Agents for Solution‐Processed Organic Solar Cells,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have the advantage of possible fabrication by energy‐efficient and cost‐effective deposition methods, such as solution processing. Solvent additives can provide fine control of the active layer morphology of OPVs by influencing film formation during solution processing. As such, solvent additives form a versatile method of experimental control for improving organic solar cell device performance. This review provides a brief history of solution‐processed bulk heterojunction OPVs and the advent of solvent additives, putting them into context with other methods available for morphology control. It presents the current understanding of how solvent additives impact various mechanisms of phase separation, enabled by recent advances in in situ morphology characterization. Indeed, understanding solvent additives' effects on film formation has allowed them to be applied and combined effectively and synergistically to boost OPV performance. Their success as a morphology control strategy has also prompted the use of solvent additives in related organic semiconductor technologies. Finally, the role of solvent additives in the development of next‐generation OPV active layers is discussed. Despite concerns over their environmental toxicity and role in device instability, solvent additives remain relevant morphological directing agents as research interests evolve toward nonfullerene acceptors, ternary blends, and environmentally sustainable solvents."
85,10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00157,2020,Narrowing the Band Gap: The Key to High-Performance Organic Photovoltaics.,"ConspectusOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention in the last two decades to overcome the terawatt energy challenge and serious environmental problems. During their early development, only wide-band-gap organic semiconductors were synthesized and employed as the active layer, mainly utilizing photons in the UV-visible region and yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) lower than 5%. Afterward, considerable efforts were made to narrow the polymer donor band gap in order to utilize the infrared photons, which led to the enhancement of the PCE from 5% to 12% in about a decade. Since 2017, the study of narrow-band-gap non-fullerene acceptors helped usher in a new era in OPV research and boosted the achievable the PCE to 17% in only 3 years. In essence, the history of OPV development in the last 15 years can be summarized as an attempt to narrow the band gap of organic semiconductors and better position the energy levels. There are multiple benefits of a narrower band gap: (1) considerable infrared photons can be utilized, and as a result, the short-circuit current density can increase significantly; (2) the energy offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels or highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels between the donor and acceptor can be reduced, which will reduce the open-circuit voltage loss by minimizing the loss caused by the donor/acceptor charge transfer state; (3) because of the unique molecular orbitals of organic semiconductors, the red-shifted absorption will induce high transmittance in the visible region, which is ideal for the rear subcells in tandem-junction OPVs and transparent OPVs.In this Account, we first summarize our work beginning in 2008 on the design and synthesis of narrow-band-gap polymer donors/non-fullerene acceptors. Several strategies for constructing these materials, including enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer effect and steric hindrance/energy level engineering are discussed. In this part, in addition to systematic analyses of the design of narrow-band-gap polymer donors based on BDT/TT or BDT/DPP, donors/acceptors based on the new donor moieties DTP or BZPT are discussed as well. Especially, we highlight our work on the first report on the narrow-band-gap acceptor Y1 (based on the new donor moiety BZPT), which pioneered the future development and usage of acceptors belonging to the Y1 family (or series). Subsequently, we analyze several reported certified world record single-junction or tandem-junction OPVs that use these narrow-band-gap donors or acceptors. We share our experiences and insights from a device perspective in terms of donor/acceptor selection, energy level alignment management, film morphology control, current matching of subcells, interconnecting layer construction, interface engineering, and device geometry selection. In this part, the construction of high-performance ternary-blend OPVs and transparent OPVs based on these narrow-band-gap donors/acceptors is also discussed. Finally, in order to push the field into the 20-25% high-efficiency era in the next few years, some suggestions to further develop narrow-band-gap donors/acceptors and related device technologies are proposed."
86,10.15585/mmwr.mm7049a1,2021,"Update on Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Outbreaks — Worldwide, January 2020–June 2021","As of May 1, 2016, use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) type 2 for routine and supplementary immunization activities ceased after a synchronized global switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV; containing Sabin strain types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV; containing Sabin strain types 1 and 3) subsequent to the certified eradication of wild type poliovirus (WPV) type 2 in 2015 (1-3). Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks* occur when transmission of Sabin strain poliovirus is prolonged in underimmunized populations, allowing viral genetic reversion to neurovirulence, resulting in cases of paralytic polio (1-3). Since the switch, monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2, containing Sabin strain type 2) has been used for response to cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks; tOPV is used if cVDPV2 co-circulates with WPV type 1, and bOPV is used for cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) or type 3 (cVDPV3) outbreaks (1-4). In November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing procedure authorized limited use of type 2 novel OPV (nOPV2), a vaccine modified to be more genetically stable than the Sabin strain, for cVDPV2 outbreak response (3,5). In October 2021, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (WHO's principal advisory group) permitted wider use of nOPV2; however, current nOPV2 supply is limited (6). This report updates that of July 2019-February 2020 to describe global cVDPV outbreaks during January 2020-June 2021 (as of November 9, 2021)† (3). During this period, there were 44 cVDPV outbreaks of the three serotypes affecting 37 countries. The number of cVDPV2 cases increased from 366 in 2019 to 1,078 in 2020 (7). A goal of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative's (GPEI) 2022-2026 Strategic Plan is to better address the challenges to early CVDPV2 outbreak detection and initiate prompt and high coverage outbreak responses with available type 2 OPV to interrupt transmission by the end of 2023 (8)."

The development of OPV materials, especially electron acceptors, has been one of the focuses in recent years. Compared with fullerene derivates, n-type nonfullerene molecules have some unique merits, such as synthesis simplicity, high tunability of the absorption and energy levels, and small energy loss. In the last five years, organic solar cells based on n-type nonfullerene molecules have achieved a significant breakthrough in the power conversion efficiency from approximately 4% to over 17%, superior to fullerene-based solar cells; meanwhile, n-type nonfullerene molecules have created brand new opportunities for application of OPVs in some special situations. This Perspective analyzes the key design strategies of high-performance n-type molecular photovoltaic materials and highlights instructive examples of their various applications, including in ternary and tandem solar cells towards high efficiency, semitransparent solar cells towards power generating building facades and windows, and indoor photovoltaics for driving low power consumption devices. Moreover, to accelerate the pace towards commercialization of OPVs, the existing challenges and future directions are also discussed from the perspectives of efficiency, stability and large-area fabrication."
88,10.1146/ANNUREV.MICRO.58.030603.123625,2005,Vaccine-derived polioviruses and the endgame strategy for global polio eradication.,"As the global eradication of wild poliovirus nears, the World Health Organization (WHO) is addressing challenges unprecedented in public health. The live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), used for more than four decades to interrupt poliovirus transmission, and the vaccine of choice for developing countries, is genetically unstable. Reversion of the small number of substitutions conferring the attenuated phenotype frequently occurs during OPV replication in humans and is the underlying cause of the rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in OPV recipients and their close contacts. Whereas VAPP has long been recognized, two other adverse events have been identified more recently: (a) long-term excretion of highly evolved vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) in persons with primary immunodeficiencies, and (b) polio outbreaks associated with circulating VDPVs in areas with low rates of OPV coverage. Developing a posteradication strategy to minimize the risks of VDPV emergence and spread has become an urgent WHO priority."

90,10.1002/adfm.202206707,2022,Managing Challenges in Organic Photovoltaics: Properties and Roles of Donor/Acceptor Interfaces,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have demonstrated increasing potential for use in large‐area, flexible, and light‐weight applications. To date, the rapid development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) and their conjugated polymeric donors have increased the efficiency of OPV by over 19%. Nevertheless, OPV is still suffering from high energy loss, which primarily derives from the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial charge recombination. In particular, the voltage loss occurring at the D/A interface accounts for the current bottleneck, hampering further enhancement of the OPV efficiency. In this review, the recent discovery of D/A interfacial photophysics in NFA‐based OPVs, including the comparison with its fullerene‐based counterpart, is covered. Additionally, the factors governing interfacial energy loss, such as interfacial energetics and local morphologies, which causes the trade‐off relationship between photovoltage and photocurrent in OPV are highlighted. Accordingly, the control of D/A interfacial properties to create an “ideal” interface for charge generation in OPVs is reviewed; and emphasized that the D/A interfacial modifications can serve as a powerful tool to manage the challenges in OPVs path toward future practical applications."

Incorporation of plasmonic nanostructures for light trapping in these thin‐film devices offers an attractive solution to realize higher‐efficiency OPVs with PCE≫10%.

96,10.1126/sciadv.aay4275,2019,Machine learning–assisted molecular design and efficiency prediction for high-performance organic photovoltaic materials,"Machine learning can be a powerful tool to prescreen new materials, thus accelerating the development of the OPV field. In the process of finding high-performance materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), it is meaningful if one can establish the relationship between chemical structures and photovoltaic properties even before synthesizing them. Here, we first establish a database containing over 1700 donor materials reported in the literature. Through supervised learning, our machine learning (ML) models can build up the structure-property relationship and, thus, implement fast screening of OPV materials. We explore several expressions for molecule structures, i.e., images, ASCII strings, descriptors, and fingerprints, as inputs for various ML algorithms. It is found that fingerprints with length over 1000 bits can obtain high prediction accuracy. The reliability of our approach is further verified by screening 10 newly designed donor materials. Good consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained.

97,10.1542/peds.2013-3937,2014,Stool Microbiota and Vaccine Responses of Infants,"OBJECTIVE: Oral vaccine efficacy is low in less-developed countries, perhaps due to intestinal dysbiosis. This study determined if stool microbiota composition predicted infant oral and parenteral vaccine responses. METHODS: The stool microbiota of 48 Bangladeshi infants was characterized at 6, 11, and 15 weeks of age by amplification and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene V4 region and by Bifidobacterium-specific, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Responses to oral polio virus (OPV), bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), tetanus toxoid (TT), and hepatitis B virus vaccines were measured at 15 weeks by using vaccine-specific T-cell proliferation for all vaccines, the delayed-type hypersensitivity skin-test response for BCG, and immunoglobulin G responses using the antibody in lymphocyte supernatant method for OPV, TT, and hepatitis B virus. Thymic index (TI) was measured by ultrasound. RESULTS: Actinobacteria (predominantly Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis) dominated the stool microbiota, with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increasing by 15 weeks. Actinobacteria abundance was positively associated with T-cell responses to BCG, OPV, and TT; with the delayed-type hypersensitivity response; with immunoglobulin G responses; and with TI. B longum subspecies infantis correlated positively with TI and several vaccine responses. Bacterial diversity and abundance of Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales, and Clostridiales were associated with neutrophilia and lower vaccine responses. CONCLUSIONS: Bifidobacterium predominance may enhance thymic development and responses to both oral and parenteral vaccines early in infancy, whereas deviation from this pattern, resulting in greater bacterial diversity, may cause systemic inflammation (neutrophilia) and lower vaccine responses. Vaccine responsiveness may be improved by promoting intestinal bifidobacteria and minimizing dysbiosis early in infancy."
98,10.1002/anie.201915030,2020,Tuning the hybridization of local exciton and charge-transfer states in highly efficient organic photovoltaic cells.,"Decreasing the energy loss is one of the most feasible ways to improve the efficiencies of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Recent studies have suggested that non-radiative energy loss is the dominant factor that hinders further improvements in state-of-the-art OPV cells. However, there is no rational molecular design strategy for OPV materials with suppressed non-radiative energy loss. In this work, taking molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a quantitative parameter, we establish a general relationship between chemical structure and intermolecular interactions. The results reveal that increasing the ESP difference between donor and acceptor will enhance the intermolecular interaction. In the OPV cells, the enhanced intermolecular interaction will increase the charge transfer state ratio in its hybridization with local exciton to facilitate the charge generation but simultaneously result in a larger non-radiative energy loss. These results suggest that finely tuning the ESP of OPV materials is a feasible method to further improve the efficiencies of OPV cells."
99,10.1039/C4EE00260A,2014,Recent progress in organic photovoltaics: device architecture and optical design,"Research on organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials and devices has flourished in recent years due to their potential for offering low-cost solar energy conversion. With a deepened understanding on the fundamental photovoltaic processes in organic electronic materials and the development of tailored materials and device architectures, we have seen a rapid increase in the efficiency of OPV devices to over 10%, which attracts tremendous commercial interests for further development and manufacturing.

100,10.1021/nn1015874,2010,Organic photovoltaic devices using highly flexible reduced graphene oxide films as transparent electrodes.,"The chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was transferred onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates and then used as transparent and conductive electrodes for flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The performance of the OPV devices mainly depends on the charge transport efficiency through rGO electrodes when the optical transmittance of rGO is above 65%. However, if the transmittance of rGO is less than 65%, the performance of the OPV device is dominated by the light transmission efficiency, that is, the transparency of rGO films. After the tensile strain (∼2.9%) was applied on the fabricated OPV device, it can sustain a thousand cycles of bending. Our work demonstrates the highly flexible property of rGO films, which provide the potential applications in flexible optoelectronics."
101,10.1093/infdis/jiu295,2014,Vaccine-derived polioviruses.,"The attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has many properties favoring its use in polio eradication: ease of administration, efficient induction of intestinal immunity, induction of durable humoral immunity, and low cost. Despite these advantages, OPV has the disadvantage of genetic instability, resulting in rare and sporadic cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and the emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). Whereas VAPP is an adverse event following exposure to OPV, VDPVs are polioviruses whose genetic properties indicate prolonged replication or transmission. Three categories of VDPVs are recognized: (1) circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) from outbreaks in settings of low OPV coverage, (2) immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) from individuals with primary immunodeficiencies, and (3) ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), which cannot be definitively assigned to either of the first 2 categories. Because most VDPVs are type 2, the World Health Organization's plans call for coordinated worldwide replacement of trivalent OPV with bivalent OPV containing poliovirus types 1 and 3."

Non-fullerene OPVs adopting p-type conjugated polymers as the donor and n-type small molecules as the acceptor have exhibited steady progress, outperforming PCBM-based solar cells and reaching efficiencies of over 15% in 2019. This review starts with a refreshed discussion of charge separation, recombination, and VOC loss in non-fullerene OPVs, followed by a review of work undertaken to develop favorable molecular configurations required for high device performance. We summarize several key approaches that have been employed to tune the nanoscale morphology in non-fullerene photovoltaic blends, comparing them (where appropriate) to their PCBM-based counterparts. In particular, we discuss issues ranging from materials chemistry to solution processing and post-treatments, showing how this can lead to enhanced photovoltaic properties. Particular attention is given to the control of molecular configuration through solution processing, which can have a pronounced impact on the structure of the solid-state photoactive layer. Key challenges, including green solvent processing, stability and lifetime, burn-in, and thickness-dependence in non-fullerene OPVs are briefly discussed."

106,10.1002/aenm.202101383,2021,A Review on Emerging Barrier Materials and Encapsulation Strategies for Flexible Perovskite and Organic Photovoltaics,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have undergone rapid development within the last decade, exhibiting exciting properties such as high efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for large‐scale fabrication through roll‐to‐roll (R2R) processing. Despite this, operational stability is recognized to be an ongoing challenge as prolonged device lifetimes are scarcely observed. This instability can be narrowed down to both “intrinsic degradation” and “extrinsic degradation,” with exposure to moisture and oxygen having detrimental effects on device performance. A means of delaying the degradation of flexible PSC and OPV devices is through barrier encapsulation. Despite glass encapsulation exhibiting ideal barrier properties, the potential for flexible devices and high‐throughput R2R fabrication requires the development of flexible barrier materials and encapsulation strategies. These barriers must demonstrate outstanding moisture permeation resistance, high transparency, chemical and thermal stability, and must be able to withstand repeated mechanical deformation. Herein, the fundamental principles of PSC and OPV devices are initially discussed, highlighting the degradation mechanisms and current stability obstacles. A review of the latest flexible barrier materials and encapsulation strategies follows, introducing stability studies that have been undertaken on flexible PSCs and OPV, along with suggestions as to the direction that future research may take."

Emission spectra of the commonly used indoor light sources are much narrower with lower light intensity as compared to the standard solar spectrum. Highly tunability in optical absorption, insensitivity to series resistance and the active layer thickness, and mild operating conditions make indoor OPV cells promising as a practically relevant technology. Currently, the OPV module has obtained a power conversion efficiency of over 20%, with excellent stability under indoor conditions. However, at the present stage, the device physics investigations and material design strategies developed in an OPV cell for indoor applications lag behind outdoor applications. In particular, the emerging characterizations in photovoltaic measurements have severely affected the reliability of reports. This Spotlight on Applications highlights these opportunities and challenges of OPV cells for indoor applications, and review the recent progress in indoor OPV cells. In addition, we also summarize some studies related to accurate measurement and provide some recommendations."

Despite these improvements in performance, the commercial viability of organic photovoltaic products remains elusive. In this perspective, the current limitations of high performing blends are uncovered, particularly focusing on the industrial upscaling considerations of these materials, such as synthetic scalability, active layer processing, and device stability. Moreover, a simplified metric, namely, the scalability factor (SF), is introduced to evaluate the scale‐up potential of specific OPV materials and blends thereof. Of the most popular molecular design strategies investigated in recent times, it is found that the use of Y‐series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) and synthetically simple materials, such as PTQ‐10 and ternary blends, are most effective at maximizing the efficiency without negatively impacting the SF. Furthermore, the improvements that are needed, in terms of device processability and stability, are considered for industrial scale‐up and final product application.

When NDT(TDPP)(2) (TDPP = thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole) is combined with the electron acceptor PC(61)BM, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.06 ± 0.06% is achieved-a record for a PC(61)BM-based small-molecule OPV. The substantial PCE is attributed to the broad, high oscillator strength visible absorption, the ordered molecular packing, and an exceptional hole mobility of NDT(TDPP)(2)."
110,10.1002/aenm.202100342,2021,Progress in Upscaling Organic Photovoltaic Devices,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have recently undergone a rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) under AM1.5G conditions, as certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which have jumped from 11.5% in October 2017 to 18.2% in December 2020. However, the NREL certified PCE of large area OPV modules is still lagging far behind (11.7% in July 2020). Additionally, there has been a rapidly growing interest in the use of OPVs for dim light indoor applications, with reported PCE of some large area (≥1 cm2) devices, under 1000 lux, well above 20%. The transition of OPV from the lab to the market requires the development of effective manufacturing processes that can scale‐up laboratory‐scale devices into large area devices, without sacrificing performance and simultaneously minimizing associated manufacturing costs. This review article focuses on four important challenges that OPV technology has to face to achieve a reliable lab‐to‐fab transfer, namely: i) The upscaling of indium‐tin‐oxide (ITO)‐based single cells and the interconnection of single cells into large area modules; ii) the development of alternatives to vacuum processing; iii) the development of alternatives to ITO‐based substrates; and iv) strategies for improving the lifetime of large area OPV devices."
111,10.1002/adma.202108090,2021,A High‐Performance Nonfused Wide‐Bandgap Acceptor for Versatile Photovoltaic Applications,"Wide‐bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS‐OEH, GS‐OC6, and GS‐ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70 eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS‐OEH and GS‐OC6, GS‐ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS‐ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0 × 10−2. The OPV cell based on PBDB‐TF:GS‐ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB‐TF:GS‐ISO‐based cell with effective area of 1.0 cm2 exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700 K illumination of 500 lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB‐TF:GS‐ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS‐ISO‐based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS‐ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications."
112,10.1021/jacs.8b12982,2019,High Exciton Diffusion Coefficients in Fused Ring Electron Acceptor Films.,"Modest exciton diffusion lengths dictate the need for nanostructured bulk heterojunctions in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells; however, this morphology compromises charge collection. Here, we reveal rapid exciton diffusion in films of a fused-ring electron acceptor that, when blended with a donor, already outperforms fullerene-based OPV cells. Temperature-dependent ultrafast exciton annihilation measurements are used to resolve a quasi-activationless exciton diffusion coefficient of at least 2 × 10-2 cm2/s, substantially exceeding typical organic semiconductors and consistent with the 20-50 nm domain sizes in optimized blends. Enhanced three-dimensional diffusion is shown to arise from molecular and packing factors; the rigid planar molecular structure is associated with low reorganization energy, good transition dipole moment alignment, high chromophore density, and low disorder, all enhancing long-range resonant energy transfer. Relieving exciton diffusion constraints has important implications for OPVs; large, ordered, and pure domains enhance charge separation and transport, and suppress recombination, thereby boosting fill factors. Further enhancements to diffusion lengths may even obviate the need for the bulk heterojunction morphology."

In such instances, a data‐driven approach using machine learning (ML) is an efficient alternative; however, bridging the gap between experimental observations and data science requires a number of refinements. In this investigation, using a random forest model based on an experimental dataset, a high correlation coefficient of 0.85 is achieved for the ML of polymer and non‐fullerene small molecule acceptor OPVs and performed virtual screening of 200,932 conjugated polymers generated by the combinatorial coupling of donor and acceptor units. Further, to evaluate the effectiveness of the ML model, a series of conjugated polymers (based on benzodithiophene and thiazolothiazole) were designed, synthesized, and characterized with different alkyl chains. Among these, PBDTTzEH:IT‐4F showed a PCE of 10.10%, which is in good correspondence with ML predictions with respect to the choice of alkyl chains. Thus, the current study demonstrates how ML can be utilized for developing OPVs using a relatively small number of experimental data points (566) and screening numerous molecular structures."
114,10.1039/C3EE43460E,2014,From lab to fab: how must the polymer solar cell materials design change? – an industrial perspective,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, in particular polymer solar cells, made by solution processed organic materials have shown great promise as a disruptive technology for affordable electricity. Even though recent advances look impressive on paper, until now the commercialization of OPV has been hampered by the difficulty of converting lab produced “champion” cell figures into reliable industrial-scale product performances. A key factor to achieve this condition is to develop OPV materials (polymer donors, acceptors, buffer materials, electrodes materials and encapsulants) exhibiting the required technical and economic characteristics to be conveniently used in an industrial environment. The well established strategies for the design of materials for efficient lab-scale OPV devices are not sufficient when large-area printed panels are concerned. A number of additional requirements, normally not addressed in the laboratory context, must be met: the materials must be easily accessible as pure compounds in few synthetic steps from cheap starting compounds, need to be stable and soluble enough to afford ink formulations processable with roll-to-roll compatible equipment; solvent and solvent additives should be easily removable after printing, and possibly should be environmentally friendly compounds; the layers should achieve a stable morphology under mild conditions (low temperatures and short times); the above mentioned materials can be screened on glass substrates, but should be finally tested on plastic films, protected through a scalable encapsulation technique. The more researchers adhere to these guidelines, the greater the possibility for OPV to demonstrate at last its enormous potential on the industrial scale."

Recent work in material design has primarily focused on developing near‐infrared nonfullerene acceptors with broadening absorption that pair with commercialized donor polymers; in the meanwhile, the influence of the morphology of the blend film and the energy level alignment on the efficiency of charge separation needs to be synthetically considered. Herein, the selection rule of the donor/acceptor blend is demonstrated by rationally considering the molecular interaction and energy level alignment, and highly efficient OPV devices using both‐fluorinated or both‐nonfluorinated donor/acceptor blends are realized. With the enlarged absorption, ideal morphology, and efficient charge transfer, the devices based on the PBDB‐T‐F/Y1‐4F blend and PBDB‐T‐F/Y6 exhibit champion power conversion efficiencies as high as 14.8% and 15.9%, respectively."

117,10.1021/jacs.0c13352,2021,Nonradiative Triplet Loss Suppressed in Organic Photovoltaic Blends with Fluoridated Nonfullerene Acceptors.,"In organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends, photogenerated excitons dissociate into charge-separated electrons and holes at donor/acceptor interfaces. The bimolecular recombination of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes may cause nonradiative loss by forming the low-lying triplet excited states (T1) via the intermediate charge-transfer triplet states. Here, we show that such a spin-related loss channel can be suppressed in the OPV blends with fluorinated nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). By combining ultrafast optical spectroscopy and triplet sensitization measurements, the T1 states at the acceptors have been observed to generate from the charge-separated electrons and holes in the OPV blends with a same polymer donor and two sets of NFAs with and without fluorination. The triplet formation is largely suppressed and the lifetime of charge carrier is markedly prolonged in the blends with fluorinated NFAs. The fluorination effect on the charge dynamics can be ascribed to the modified energy alignment between the triplet excited states of charge-transfer and locally excited characters as supported by quantum chemical computation. Our findings explain the mechanism responsible for the improved photocurrent generation in the OPV blends with fluorinated NFAs, suggesting that manipulating the energy landscape of triplet excited states is a promising strategy for further optimizing OPV devices."
118,10.1002/adma.202105803,2021,A Universal Nonhalogenated Polymer Donor for High‐Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells,"Nonhalogenated polymers have great potential in the commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low‐cost preparation. However, non‐halogenated polymers usually have high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and inferior self‐aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers are used to fabricate OPV cells with BTP‐eC9, the PB1‐based device only gives a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2‐based device shows an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB‐TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB‐TF:BTP‐eC9‐based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieves a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibits good compatibility with various nonfullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB‐T and PBDB‐TF)‐based devices. When PB2 is combined with a wide‐bandgap electron acceptor (F‐BTA3), this device shows excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm2 devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light‐emitting diode illumination. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of low‐cost materials and broadening the application of OPV cells."
119,10.1021/ja502985g,2014,Importance of the donor:fullerene intermolecular arrangement for high-efficiency organic photovoltaics.,"The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) material systems are hypothesized to depend strongly on the intermolecular arrangements at the donor:fullerene interfaces. A review of some of the most efficient polymers utilized in polymer:fullerene PV devices, combined with an analysis of reported polymer donor materials wherein the same conjugated backbone was used with varying alkyl substituents, supports this hypothesis. Specifically, the literature shows that higher-performing donor-acceptor type polymers generally have acceptor moieties that are sterically accessible for interactions with the fullerene derivative, whereas the corresponding donor moieties tend to have branched alkyl substituents that sterically hinder interactions with the fullerene. To further explore the idea that the most beneficial polymer:fullerene arrangement involves the fullerene docking with the acceptor moiety, a family of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione polymers (PBDTTPD derivatives) was synthesized and tested in a variety of PV device types with vastly different aggregation states of the polymer. In agreement with our hypothesis, the PBDTTPD derivative with a more sterically accessible acceptor moiety and a more sterically hindered donor moiety shows the highest performance in bulk-heterojunction, bilayer, and low-polymer concentration PV devices where fullerene derivatives serve as the electron-accepting materials. Furthermore, external quantum efficiency measurements of the charge-transfer state and solid-state two-dimensional (2D) (13)C{(1)H} heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) NMR analyses support that a specific polymer:fullerene arrangement is present for the highest performing PBDTTPD derivative, in which the fullerene is in closer proximity to the acceptor moiety of the polymer. This work demonstrates that the polymer:fullerene arrangement and resulting intermolecular interactions may be key factors in determining the performance of OPV material systems."

Improving the light‐absorbing selectivity, that is, transmitting the visible photons while absorbing the invisible ones, is a key step toward high‐performance ST‐OPV. To achieve this goal, the optical properties of the active layer, transparent electrode, and capping layer are comprehensively tailored, and a highly efficient ST‐OPV with good absorbing selectivity is demonstrated. First, a numerical method is established to quantify the absorbing selectivity of materials and devices, based on which, an infrared absorbing non‐fullerene acceptor, that is, H3, is selected among a large pool of photo‐active materials. Second, an ultra‐smooth transparent thin Ag layer with small granule size is developed via polyethylenimine wetting, which alleviates light scattering and improves the electric properties for ST‐OPV. Finally, as guided by optical simulation, a TeO2 capping layer is deposited on top of the ultra‐thin Ag to further improve the light‐absorbing selectivity. As a result, the light utilization efficiency is significantly improved to 3.95 ± 0.02% (best ≈4.06%), with a good color rendering index of 76.85. These results make it one of the best among color‐neutral ST‐OPVs. This work stresses the importance of manipulating the light‐absorbing selectivity for high‐performance ST‐OPVs."
121,10.1002/adma.201904512,2019,1 cm2 Organic Photovoltaic Cells for Indoor Application with over 20% Efficiency,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies have the advantages of fabricating larger‐area and light‐weight solar panels on flexible substrates by low‐cost roll‐to‐toll production. Recently, OPV cells have achieved many significant advances with power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing rapidly. However, large‐scale solar farms using OPV modules still face great challenges, such as device stability. Herein, the applications of OPV cells in indoor light environments are studied. Via optimizing the active layers to have a good match with the indoor light source, 1 cm2 OPV cells are fabricated and a top PCE of 22% under 1000 lux light‐emitting diode (2700 K) illumination is demonstrated. In this work, the light intensities are measured carefully. Incorporated with the external quantum efficiency and photon flux spectrum, the integral current densities of the cells are calculated to confirm the reliability of the photovoltaic measurement. In addition, the devices show much better stability under continuous indoor light illumination. The results suggest that designing wide‐bandgap active materials to meet the requirements for the indoor OPV cells has a great potential in achieving higher photovoltaic performance."

However, increasing the PCE further requires an improved understanding of the factors limiting the device efficiency. Here, the efficiency limits of single‐junction and two‐terminal tandem NFA‐based OPV cells are examined with the aid of a numerical device simulator that takes into account the optical properties of the active material(s), charge recombination effects, and the hole and electron mobilities in the active layer of the device. The simulations reveal that single‐junction NFA OPVs can potentially reach PCE values in excess of 18% with mobility values readily achievable in existing material systems. Furthermore, it is found that balanced electron and hole mobilities of >10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in combination with low nongeminate recombination rate constants of 10−12 cm3 s−1 could lead to PCE values in excess of 20% and 25% for single‐junction and two‐terminal tandem OPV cells, respectively. This analysis provides the first tangible description of the practical performance targets and useful design rules for single‐junction and tandem OPVs based on NFA materials, emphasizing the need for developing new material systems that combine these desired characteristics."
123,10.1002/anie.202102622,2021,Impact of electrostatic interaction on bulk morphology in efficient donor-acceptor photovoltaic blends.,"Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a critical role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thereby determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology-performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. In this work, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular orientation at the D-A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. In addition, enhancing the D-A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Our work proposes a molecular design strategy that can finely-tune the bulk morphology to achieve balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells."

Here, we investigate the effects of DIO on the long-term stability of the active layer by studying the photodegradation under ambient white light illumination of the polymer PTB7-Th in pure polymer thin films and in blend films with PC71BM. Using X-ray fluorescence, we directly detect iodine in the active layer films, indicating the presence of residual DIO after casting from solution. Additionally, we show that this residual DIO dramatically decreases the photostability of the active layer. Structural changes in the films upon illumination are probed with grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). FTIR spectroscopy is used to monitor chemical changes in the polymer structure during irradiation in the presence of DIO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that film treatment either with high vacuum (10–8 Torr) for 60 min or with a high-temperature thermal anneal ..."

However, solid additives with the merits of good stability and reproducibility have been rarely used to fine-tune the morphology of the LBL films for improved efficiency and stability. Herein, hierarchical morphology control in LBL OPV is achieved via a dual functional solid additive. Series of LBL devices are fabricated by introducing the solid additive individually or simultaneously to the donor or acceptor layer to clarify the functions of additives. Additive in the donor layer can facilitate the formation of preferable vertical component distribution, and that in the acceptor layer will enhance the molecular crystallinity for better charge transport properties. The optimized morphology ultimately contributed to high PCEs of 16.4% and 17.4% in the binary and quaternary LBL devices. This reported method provides an alternative way to controllably manipulate the morphology of LBL OPV cells."

Because OPV can rarely cause paralysis and generate revertant polio strains, IPV will have to replace OPV after eradication of wild polio virus is certified to sustain eradication of all polioviruses. However, uncertainties remain related to IPV's ability to induce intestinal immunity in populations where fecal-oral transmission is predominant. Although substantial effectiveness and safety data exist on the use and delivery of OPV and IPV, several new research initiatives are currently underway to fill specific knowledge gaps to inform future vaccination policies that would assure polio is eradicated and eradication is maintained."
127,10.1002/adma.201903173,2019,Enhanced Light Utilization in Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Using an Optical Outcoupling Architecture,"Building‐integrated photovoltaics employing transparent photovoltaic cells on window panes provide an opportunity to convert solar energy to electricity rather than generating waste heat. Semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (ST‐OPVs) that utilize a nonfullerene acceptor‐based near‐infrared (NIR) absorbing ternary cell combined with a thin, semitransparent, high conductivity Cu‐Ag alloy electrode are demonstrated. A combination of optical outcoupling and antireflection coatings leads to enhanced visible transmission, while reflecting the NIR back into the cell where it is absorbed. This combination of coatings results in doubling of the light utilization efficiency (LUE), which is equal to the product of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the average photopic transparency, compared with a conventional semitransparent cell lacking these coatings. A maximum LUE = 3.56 ± 0.11% is achieved for an ST‐OPV with a PCE = 8.0 ± 0.2% at 1 sun, reference AM1.5G spectrum. Moreover, neutral colored ST‐OPVs are also demonstrated, with LUE = 2.56 ± 0.2%, along with Commission Internationale d'Eclairage chromaticity coordinates of CIE = (0.337, 0.349) and a color rendering index of CRI = 87."
128,10.1002/aenm.201801032,2018,Toward Predicting Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells via Machine Learning and Improved Descriptors,"To design efficient materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), it is essential to identify the largest number of parameters that control their properties and build a model using these parameters (known as descriptors) for the prediction of the power conversion efficiency (PCE). By constructing a dataset for 280 small molecule OPV systems, it is found that for all high‐performing devices, frontier molecular orbitals of donor molecules are nearly degenerated and in such cases, orbitals other than just highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are involved in exciton formation, exciton dissociation, and hole transport processes influencing the macroscopic properties of OPVs. Machine learning approaches, including random forest, gradient boosting, deep neural network are used to build models for the prediction of PCE using 13 important microscopic properties of organic materials as descriptors. Quite impressive performance of the gradient boosting model (Pearson's coefficient = 0.79) indicates that it can certainly be applied to high‐throughput virtual screening of promising new donor molecules for high‐efficiency OPVs."
129,10.15585/mmwr.mm6535a3,2016,"Cessation of Trivalent Oral Poliovirus Vaccine and Introduction of Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine - Worldwide, 2016.","Since the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis, transmission of the three types of wild poliovirus (WPV) has been sharply reduced (1). WPV type 2 (WPV2) has not been detected since 1999 and was declared eradicated in September 2015. Because WPV type 3 has not been detected since November 2012, WPV type 1 (WPV1) is likely the only WPV that remains in circulation (1). This marked progress has been achieved through widespread use of oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs), most commonly trivalent OPV (tOPV), which contains types 1, 2, and 3 live, attenuated polioviruses and has been a mainstay of efforts to prevent polio since the early 1960s. However, attenuated polioviruses in OPV can undergo genetic changes during replication, and in communities with low vaccination coverage, can result in vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) that can cause paralytic polio indistinguishable from the disease caused by WPVs (2). Among the 721 polio cases caused by circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs*) detected during January 2006-May 2016, type 2 cVDPVs (cVDPV2s) accounted for >94% (2). Eliminating the risk for polio caused by VDPVs will require stopping all OPV use. The first stage of OPV withdrawal involved a global, synchronized replacement of tOPV with bivalent OPV (bOPV) containing only types 1 and 3 attenuated polioviruses, planned for April 18-May 1, 2016, thereby withdrawing OPV type 2 from all immunization activities (3). Complementing the switch from tOPV to bOPV, introduction of at least 1 dose of injectable, trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) into childhood immunization schedules reduces risks from and facilitates responses to cVDPV2 outbreaks. All 155 countries and territories that were still using OPV in immunization schedules in 2015 have reported that they had ceased use of tOPV by mid-May 2016.(†) As of August 31, 2016, 173 (89%) of 194 World Health Organization (WHO) countries included IPV in their immunization schedules.(§) The cessation of tOPV use is a major milestone toward the global goal of eradicating polio; however, careful surveillance for polioviruses and prompt, aggressive responses to polio outbreaks are still needed to realize a polio-free world."

Despite the recent fast progress in materials informatics and data science, data-driven molecular design of OPV materials remains challenging. We report a screening of conjugated molecules for polymer-fullerene OPV applications by supervised learning methods (artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF)). Approximately 1000 experimental parameters including PCE, molecular weight, and electronic properties are manually collected from the literature and subjected to machine learning with digitized chemical structures. Contrary to the low correlation coefficient in ANN, RF yields an acceptable accuracy, which is twice that of random classification. We demonstrate the application of RF screening for the design, synthesis, and characterization of a conjugated polymer, which facilitates a rapid development of optoelectronic materials."

To further improve solar cell performance, a thorough understanding of structure-property relationships associated with PTB7/fullerene and related organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is crucial. Traditionally, OPV active layers are viewed as an interpenetrating network of pure polymers and fullerenes with discrete interfaces. Here we show that the active layer of PTB7/fullerene OPV devices in fact involves hierarchical nanomorphologies ranging from several nanometers of crystallites to tens of nanometers of nanocrystallite aggregates in PTB7-rich and fullerene-rich domains, themselves hundreds of nanometers in size. These hierarchical nanomorphologies are coupled to significantly enhanced exciton dissociation, which consequently contribute to photocurrent, indicating that the nanostructural characteristics at multiple length scales is one of the key factors determining the performance of PTB7 copolymer, and likely most polymer/fullerene systems, in OPV devices."

In this work, we show the developments and results of a successful upscaling of such highly efficient OPV systems to the module level on large areas, which yielded two new certified world record efficiencies, namely, 12.6% on a module area of 26 cm2 and 11.7% on a module area of 204 cm2. The decisive developments leading to this achievement include the optimization of the module layout as well as the high‐resolution short‐pulse (nanosecond) laser structuring processes involved in the manufacturing of such modules. By minimizing the inactive areas within the total module area that are used for interconnecting the individual solar cells of the module in series, geometric fill factors of over 95% have been achieved. A production yield of 100% working modules during the manufacturing of these modules and an extremely narrow distribution of the final PCE values underline the excellent process control and reproducibility of the results. The new developments and their implementation into the production process of the record OPV modules are described in detail, along with the challenges that arose during this development. Finally, dark lock‐in thermography (DLIT), electroluminescence (EL), and photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the record module are presented."

In the past few years, although the PCE of the OPV cells has been considerably improved, the research on device stability is limited. Herein, a cross-linkable material, cross-linked [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (c-PCBSD), is applied as an interfacial modification layer on the surface of zinc oxide and as the third component into the PBDB-TF:Y6-based OPV cells to enhance photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. The PCE of the OPV cells that underwent the two-step modification increased from 15.1 to 16.1%. In particular, such OPV cells exhibited much better stability under both thermal and air conditions because of the decreased number of interfacial defects and stable interfacial and active layer morphologies.

We report a detailed techno-economic analysis of one such application, namely the photovoltaic greenhouse, and discuss whether the unique properties of the technology can provide advantages over conventional photovoltaics. The potential for spectral selectivity through the choice of OPV materials is evaluated for the case of a photovoltaic greenhouse. The action spectrum of typical greenhouse crops is used to determine the impact on crop growth of blocking different spectral ranges from the crops. Transfer matrix optical modelling is used to assess the efficiency and spectrally resolved transparency of a variety of commercially available semi-conducting polymer materials, in addition to a non-commercial low-band-gap material with absorption outside that required for crop growth. Economic analysis suggests there could be a huge potential for OPV greenhouses if aggressive cost targets can be met. Technical analysis shows that semi-transparent OPV devices may struggle to perform better than opaque crystalline silicon with partial coverage, however, OPV devices using the low-band-gap material PMDPP3T, as well as a high efficiency mid-band-gap polymer PCDTBT, can demonstrate improved performance in comparison to opaque, flexible thin-film modules such as CIGS.

139,10.1093/infdis/jiu184,2014,Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis: a review of the epidemiology and estimation of the global burden.,"BACKGROUND
Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) is a rare adverse event associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). This review summarizes the epidemiology and provides a global burden estimate.


METHODS
A literature review was conducted to abstract the epidemiology and calculate the risk of VAPP. A bootstrap method was applied to calculate global VAPP burden estimates.


RESULTS
Trends in VAPP epidemiology varied by country income level. In the low-income country, the majority of cases occurred in individuals who had received >3 doses of OPV (63%), whereas in middle and high-income countries, most cases occurred in recipients after their first OPV dose or unvaccinated contacts (81%). Using all risk estimates, VAPP risk was 4.7 cases per million births (range, 2.4-9.7), leading to a global annual burden estimate of 498 cases (range, 255-1018). If the analysis is limited to estimates from countries that currently use OPV, the VAPP risk is 3.8 cases per million births (range, 2.9-4.7) and a burden of 399 cases (range, 306-490).


CONCLUSIONS
Because many high-income countries have replaced OPV with inactivated poliovirus vaccine, the VAPP burden is concentrated in lower-income countries. The planned universal introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine is likely to substantially decrease the global VAPP burden by 80%-90%."

Photovoltaics are a strong candidate, more specifically, organic photovoltaics (OPV), enabling the design of flexible, lightweight, semitransparent, and low-cost solar cells. However, the active layer of OPV is, for now, mainly deposited from chlorinated solvents, harmful for the environment and for human health. Active layers processed from health and environmentally friendly solvents have over recent years formed a key focus topic of research, with the creation of aqueous dispersions of conjugated polymer nanoparticles arising. These nanoparticles are formed from organic semiconductors (molecules and macromolecules) initially designed for organic solvents. The topic of nanoparticle OPV has gradually garnered more attention, up to a point where in 2018 it was identified as a ""trendsetting strategy"" by leaders in the international OPV research community. Hence, this review has been prepared to provide a timely roadmap of the formation and application of aqueous nanoparticle dispersions of active layer components for OPV. We provide a thorough synopsis of recent developments in both nanoprecipitation and miniemulsion for preparing photovoltaic inks, facilitating readers in acquiring a deep understanding of the crucial synthesis parameters affecting particle size, colloidal concentration, ink stability, and more. This review also showcases the experimental levers for identifying and optimizing the internal donor-acceptor morphology of the nanoparticles, featuring cutting-edge X-ray spectromicroscopy measurements reported over the past decade. The different strategies to improve the incorporation of these inks into OPV devices and to increase their efficiency (to the current record of 7.5%) are reported, in addition to critical design choices of surfactant type and the advantages of single-component vs binary nanoparticle populations. The review naturally culminates by presenting the upscaling strategies in practice for this environmentally friendly and safer production of solar cells."
141,10.1002/adfm.202010000,2021,Flexible High‐Performance and Solution‐Processed Organic Photovoltaics with Robust Mechanical Stability,"Among the various advantages of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), the key one is their ability to be a highly flexible renewable energy source. However, the power conversion efficiencies for flexible OPV devices still lag behind those of their rigid counterparts, and their mechanical stability cannot meet the requirements for practical applications at present. These, in particular, depend on flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs). Here, a high‐quality FTE (called FlexAgNE), with the simultaneously combined excellent characteristics, has been tested with a series of efficient active materials for flexible OPV devices, and high performance comparable with rigid counterparts has been achieved. In addition, due to the synergistic effect of FlexAgNE and the upper ZnO transport layer, including strong binding between the polyethylene terephthalate substrate and a hydrophilic polyelectrolyte (the key component of FlexAgNE), together with the capillary force effect of crossed silver nanowires and tight filling of ZnO, the flexible devices demonstrate robust mechanical stability even under extreme bending or folding conditions."
142,10.1021/ja411859m,2014,Unequal partnership: asymmetric roles of polymeric donor and fullerene acceptor in generating free charge.,"Natural photosynthetic complexes accomplish the rapid conversion of photoexcitations into spatially separated electrons and holes through precise hierarchical ordering of chromophores and redox centers. In contrast, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are poorly ordered, utilize only two different chemical potentials, and the same materials that absorb light must also transport charge; yet, some OPV blends achieve near-perfect quantum efficiency. Here we perform electronic structure calculations on large clusters of functionalized fullerenes of different size and ordering, predicting several features of the charge generation process, outside the framework of conventional theories but clearly observed in ultrafast electro-optical experiments described herein. We show that it is the resonant coupling of photogenerated singlet excitons to a high-energy manifold of fullerene electronic states that enables efficient charge generation, bypassing localized charge-transfer states. In contrast to conventional views, our findings suggest that fullerene cluster size, concentration, and dimensionality control charge generation efficiency, independent of exciton delocalization."

The saturation dark current density, J(S), is an important factor in determining the open circuit voltage, V(oc). The V(oc) values of OPVs show a strong inverse correlation with J(S). Donor materials that show evidence for aggregation in their thin-film absorption spectra and polycrystallinity in thin film X-ray diffraction result in a high dark current, and thus a low V(oc). In contrast, donor materials with structures that hinder intermolecular pi-interaction give amorphous thin films and reduced values of J(S), relative to donors with strong intermolecular pi-interactions, leading to a high V(oc).

Microclimate conditions and tomato crop growth and yield parameters were measured in both the OPV-shaded (‘OPV’) and non-OPV-shaded (‘Control’) sections of the greenhouse. The OPV shade stabilized the canopy temperature during midday periods with the highest solar radiation intensities, performing the function of a conventional shading method. Although delayed fruit development and ripening in the OPV section resulted in lower total yields compared to the Control section (24.6 kg m−2 and 27.7 kg m−2, respectively), after the fourth (of 10 total) harvests, the average weekly yield, fruit number, and fruit mass were not significantly different between the treatment (OPV-shaded) and control group. Light use efficiency (LUE), defined as the ratio of total fruit yield to accumulated PAR received by the plant canopy, was nearly twice as high as the Control section, with 21.4 g of fruit per mole of PAR for plants in the OPV-covered section compared to 10.1 g in the Control section. Overall, this study demonstrated that the use of semi-transparent OPVs as a seasonal shade element for greenhouse production in a high-light region is feasible. However, a higher transmission of PAR and greater OPV device efficiency and durability could make OPV shades more economically viable, providing a desirable solution for co-located greenhouse crop production and renewable energy generation in hot and high-light intensity regions."
145,10.1021/MA401190R,2013,C–H Arylation Reaction: Atom Efficient and Greener Syntheses of π-Conjugated Small Molecules and Macromolecules for Organic Electronic Materials,"π-Conjugated small molecules, oligomers, and macromolecules are being used in the fabrication of a wide variety of organic electronic devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Efficient syntheses involving fewer steps, fewer toxic reagents, and highly reactive compounds are needed to lower the cost of materials in a manner that is fundamentally more eco-friendly. Additionally, synthetic approaches for π-conjugated materials with more functional group tolerance are desirable to expand the range of properties that can be realized in such materials. Developing new synthetic routes to materials can both broaden the scope of science that can be explored and increase the probability that interesting materials can be developed in an economically viable manner for inclusion in consumer products. One such synthetic strategy that can impact all of these issues is carbon–hydrogen bond activation and subsequent carbon–carbo..."

Among the three types of wild poliovirus, type 2 was declared eradicated in 2015 (1,2). The use of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV; types 1, 2, and 3 Sabin strains) ceased in April 2016 via a 1-month-long, global synchronized switch to bivalent OPV (bOPV; types 1 and 3 Sabin strains) in immunization activities (1-4). Monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2; type 2 Sabin strain) is available for cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak response immunization (1-5). The number and geographic breadth of post-switch cVDPV2 outbreaks have exceeded forecasts that trended toward zero outbreaks 4 years after the switch and assumed rapid and effective control of any that occurred (4). New cVDPV2 outbreaks have been seeded by mOPV2 use, by both suboptimal mOPV2 coverage within response zones and recently mOPV2-vaccinated children or contacts traveling outside of response zones, where children born after the global switch are fully susceptible to poliovirus type 2 transmission (2-4). In addition, new emergences can develop by inadvertent exposure to Sabin OPV2-containing vaccine (i.e., residual response mOPV2 or tOPV) (4). This report updates the January 2018-June 2019 report with information on global cVDPV outbreaks during July 2019-February 2020 (as of March 25, 2020)† (2). Among 33 cVDPV outbreaks reported during July 2019-February 2020, 31 (94%) were cVDPV2; 18 (58%) of these followed new emergences. In mid-2020, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) plans to introduce a genetically stabilized, novel OPV type 2 (nOPV2) that has a lower risk for generating VDPV2 than does Sabin mOPV2; if nOPV2 is successful in limiting new VDPV2 emergences, GPEI foresees the replacement of Sabin mOPV2 with nOPV2 for cVDPV2 outbreak responses during 2021 (2,4,6)."
147,10.1021/ACS.CHEMMATER.5B04570,2016,Electron Acceptors Based on α-Substituted Perylene Diimide (PDI) for Organic Solar Cells,"Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives functionalized at the ortho-position (αPPID, αPBDT) were synthesized and used as electron acceptors in non-fullerene organic photovoltaic cells. Because of the good planarity and strong π-stacking of ortho-functionalized PDI, the αPPID and αPBDT exhibit a strong tendency to form aggregates, which endow the materials with high electron mobility. The inverted OPVs employing αPDI-based compounds as the acceptors and PBT7-Th as the donor give the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) values: 4.92% for αPBDT-based devices and 3.61% for αPPID-based devices, which are, respectively, 39% and 4% higher than that of their β-substituted counterparts βPBDT and βPPID. Charge separation studies show more efficient exciton dissociation at interfaces between αPDI-based compounds and PTB7-Th. The results suggest that α-substituted PDI derivatives are more promising electron acceptors for organic photovoltaic (OPV) components than β-isomers."
148,10.1093/infdis/jiaa622,2021,Immunization Against Poliomyelitis and the Challenges to Worldwide Poliomyelitis Eradication,"Abstract Both inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) have contributed to the rapid disappearance of paralytic poliomyelitis from developed countries despite possessing different vaccine properties. Due to cost, ease of use, and other properties, the Expanded Programme on Immunization added OPV to the routine infant immunization schedule for low-income countries in 1974, but variable vaccine uptake and impaired immune responses due to poor sanitation limited the impact. Following launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, poliomyelitis incidence has been reduced by >99% and types 2 and 3 wild polioviruses are now eradicated, but progress against type 1 polioviruses which are now confined to Afghanistan and Pakistan has slowed due to insecurity, poor access, and other problems. A strategic, globally coordinated replacement of trivalent OPV with bivalent 1, 3 OPV in 2016 reduced the incidence of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) but allowed the escape of type 2 vaccine–derived polioviruses (VDPV2) in areas with low immunization rates and use of monovalent OPV2 in response seeded new VDPV2 outbreaks and reestablishment of type 2 endemicity. A novel, more genetically stable type 2 OPV vaccine is undergoing clinical evaluation and may soon be deployed prevent or reduce VDPV2 emergences."

While there are some distinct differences, there are also some commonalities. It is evident that morphology and the control of the morphology are important for device performance and, by controlling the thermodynamics, in particular, the interactions of the components, and by controlling kinetic parameters, like the rate of solvent evaporation, crystallization and phase separation, optimized morphologies for a given system can be achieved. While much research has focused on P3HT, it is evident that a clearer understanding of the morphology and the evolution of the morphology in low bad gap polymer systems will increase the efficiency further. While current OPVs are on the verge of breaking the 10% barrier, manipulating and controlling the morphology will still be key for device optimization and, equally important, for the fabrication of these devices in an industrial setting. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

151,10.1021/ar200119g,2012,"The modification of indium tin oxide with phosphonic acids: mechanism of binding, tuning of surface properties, and potential for use in organic electronic applications.","Transparent metal oxides, in particular, indium tin oxide (ITO), are critical transparent contact materials for applications in next-generation organic electronics, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Understanding and controlling the surface properties of ITO allows for the molecular engineering of the ITO-organic interface, resulting in fine control of the interfacial chemistries and electronics. In particular, both surface energy matching and work function compatibility at material interfaces can result in marked improvement in OLED and OPV performance. Although there are numerous ways to change the surface properties of ITO, one of the more successful surface modifications is the use of monolayers based on organic molecules with widely variable end functional groups. Phosphonic acids (PAs) are known to bind strongly to metal oxides and form robust monolayers on many different metal oxide materials. They also demonstrate several advantages over other functionalizing moieties such as silanes or carboxylic acids. Most notably, PAs can be stored in ambient conditions without degradation, and the surface modification procedures are typically robust and easy to employ. This Account focuses on our research studying PA binding to ITO, the tunable properties of the resulting surfaces, and subsequent effects on the performance of organic electronic devices. We have used surface characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) to determine that PAs bind to ITO in a predominantly bidentate fashion (where two of three oxygen atoms from the PA are involved in surface binding). Modification of the functional R-groups on PAs allows us to control and tune the surface energy and work function of the ITO surface. In one study using fluorinated benzyl PAs, we can keep the surface energy of ITO relatively low and constant but tune the surface work function. PA modification of ITO has resulted in materials that are more stable and more compatible with subsequently deposited organic materials, an effective work function that can be tuned by over 1 eV, and energy barriers to hole injection (OLED) or hole-harvesting (OPV) that can be well matched to the frontier orbital energies of the organic active layers, leading to better overall device properties."

Polythiophene (PT) and its derivatives stand out as the most promising members of the photovoltaic material family for commercial applications, owing to their low cost and high scalability of synthesis. In recent years, PTs, paired with nonfullerene acceptors, have progressed rapidly in photovoltaic performance. This Review gives an overview of the strategies in designing PTs for nonfullerene OPVs from the perspective of energy level modulation. A survey of the typical classes of nonfullerene acceptors designed for pairing with the benchmark PT, i.e., poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is also presented. Furthermore, recent achievements in understanding and controlling the film morphology for PT:nonfullerene blends are discussed in depth. In addition to the effects of molecular weight and blend ratio on film morphology, the crucial roles of miscibility between PT and nonfullerene and processing solvent in determining film microstructure and morphology are highlighted, followed by a discussion on thermal annealing and ternary active layers. Finally, the remaining questions and the prospects of the low‐cost PT:nonfullerene systems are outlined. It is hoped that this review can guide the optimization of PT:nonfullerene blends and advance their commercial applications."

To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline-coil block copolymer of oligo( p -phenylenevinylene)- b -poly(2-vinylpyridine) (OPV 5 - b -P2VP 44 , the subscripts represent the mean number of repeat units of each block), in which the basicity and coordinating/chelating ability of the P2VP segment provide a landscape for the incorporation of a variety of functional inorganic NPs. Through a self-seeding strategy, we were able to prepare monodisperse fiber-like micelles of OPV 5 - b -P2VP 44 with lengths ranging from 50 to 800 nm. Significantly, the exposed two ends of OPV core of these fiber-like micelles remained active toward further epitaxial deposition of OPV 5 - b -PNIPAM 49 (PNIPAM = poly( N -isopropylacrylamide)) and OPV 5 - b -P2VP 44 to generate uniform A-B-A and B-A-B-A-B segmented block comicelles with tunable lengths for each block. The P2VP domains in these (co-)micelles can be selectively decorated with diverse inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles as well as metal oxide coatings, to afford uniform hybrid fiber-like nanostructures.

154,10.1021/acsami.0c19198,2020,Improved Blend Film Morphology and Free Carrier Generation Provide a High-Performance Ternary Polymer Solar Cell.,"Non-fullerene organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have displayed the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) among OPVs. Herein, we describe a two-donor (PM6, TPD-3F)/one-acceptor (Y6) ternary blend having an optimized blend morphology that leads to improved OPV performance. Because TPD-3F has a HOMO energy level deeper than that of PM6, the value of VOC of the corresponding ternary device increased. Good miscibility between PM6 and TPD-3F, in conjunction with device optimization through the use of 1-chloronaphthalene as an additive, provided an optimized ternary blend morphology for efficient exciton dissociation and carrier transport and, therefore, larger PCE. Compared with the preoptimized PM6:Y6 binary device, the ternary device functioned with improvements in its short-circuit current density, value of VOC, and fill factor. As a result, the device PCE improved from 15.5 ± 0.19 to 16.6 ± 0.25% under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm-2) irradiation. The champion cell exhibited a PCE of 17.0%-a value that is one of the highest for a ternary OPV. Furthermore, such devices exhibited outstanding shelf lifetimes, with long-term stability in air (25 °C, 40% humidity) without encapsulation; the performance remained high (at 15.4%) after storage for 820 h."

All but one of the patients were either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children, and cases occurred in communities with very low (7 to 40%) rates of coverage with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV).

The vaccine-derived poliovirus associated with the outbreak had biological properties indistinguishable from those of wild poliovirus."

157,10.1039/C3EE24138F,2013,Effect of synthetic accessibility on the commercial viability of organic photovoltaics,"For organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to become a viable source of renewable energy, the synthesis of organic active-layer materials will need to be scaled to thousands of kilograms. Additionally, the ultimate cost of these materials will need to be low enough to constitute only a small fraction of the cost of the solar cell module. In this study, we present a quantitative analysis, based on published small-scale synthetic procedures, to estimate the materials costs for several promising OPV materials when produced in large quantities. The cost in dollars-per-gram ($ per g) is found to increase linearly with the number of synthetic steps required to produce each organic photoactive compound. We estimate the cost-per-Watt ($ per Wp) as a function of power conversion efficiency (PCE) for an archetypal OPV structure and find that a relatively simple molecule requiring only 3 synthetic steps will contribute a cost of 0.001 to 0.01 $ per Wp, given a solar module PCE of 10%. In contrast, a relatively complicated molecule requiring 14 synthetic steps will contribute costs in the range of 0.075 to 0.48 $ per Wp. Our findings suggest that the commercial viability of an OPV technology may depend on the synthetic accessibility of its constituent active layer materials. Additionally, this work stresses the importance of optimizing synthetic routes to minimize solvent and reagent usage as well as to minimize the number of required workup procedures in the scaled production of OPV materials."

159,10.1002/aenm.201803755,2019,Twist and Degrade—Impact of Molecular Structure on the Photostability of Nonfullerene Acceptors and Their Photovoltaic Blends,"Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) dominate organic photovoltaic (OPV) research due to their promising efficiencies and stabilities. However, there is very little investigation into the molecular processes of degradation, which is critical to guiding design of novel NFAs for long‐lived, commercially viable OPVs. Here, the important role of molecular structure and conformation in NFA photostability in air is investigated by comparing structurally similar but conformationally different promising NFAs: planar O‐IDTBR and nonplanar O‐IDFBR. A three‐phase degradation process is identified: i) initial photoinduced conformational change (i.e., torsion about the core–benzothiadiazole dihedral), induced by noncovalent interactions with environmental molecules, ii) followed by photo‐oxidation and fragmentation, leading to chromophore bleaching and degradation product formation, and iii) finally complete chromophore bleaching. Initial conformational change is a critical prerequisite for further degradation, providing fundamental understanding of the relative stability of IDTBR and IDFBR, where the already twisted IDFBR is more prone to degradation. When blended with the donor polymer poly(3‐hexylthiophene), both NFAs exhibit improved photostability while the photostability of the polymer itself is significantly reduced by the more miscible twisted NFA. The findings elucidate the important role of NFA molecular structure in photostability of OPV systems, and provide vital insights into molecular design rules for intrinsically photostable NFAs."

Instead of the conventional poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS HTL, an alternative transition metal oxide HTL (molybdenum oxide (MoO(3))) is investigated to address the issue of surface immiscibility between graphene and PEDOT:PSS. Graphene films considered here are synthesized via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) using a copper catalyst and experimental issues concerning the transfer of synthesized graphene onto the substrates of OPV are discussed. The morphology of the graphene electrode and HTL wettability on the graphene surface are shown to play important roles in the successful integration of graphene films into the OPV devices. The effect of various cathodes on the device performance is also studied. These factors (i.e., suitable HTL, graphene surface morphology and residues, and the choice of well-matching counter electrodes) will provide better understanding in utilizing graphene films as transparent conducting electrodes in future solar cell applications."
161,10.1039/C1EE01766G,2011,Economic assessment of solar electricity production from organic-based photovoltaic modules in a domestic environment,"The primary driver for development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies is the prospect of very low cost module manufacture leading to affordable solar electricity. This paper presents an economic assessment of OPV based on an existing pre-industrial manufacturing process and the associated detailed material inventory. Using life cycle costing techniques, the life cycle investment cost for a 1kWp, grid-connected OPV system is calculated, taking into account the materials, direct process energy, labour, balance of system components, design and maintenance costs. Assuming values for the performance ratio of the PV system, insolation level, inflation and interest rates, the levelised electricity cost (LEC) is calculated. Under an average solar irradiance of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, a LEC of between 0.19 €/kWh and 0.50 €/kWh was calculated for a 1kWp system, based on modules containing 7% efficient cells and assuming a 5 year module lifetime. The OPV module is found to make up the majority of the system cost while the material costs constitute the largest contribution to the cost of the OPV module. The influence of OPV module lifetime is studied using sensitivity. This paper demonstrates that competitive solar electricity from OPV is within reach if efficiencies of ca. 7% already demonstrated in lab scale devices can be achieved in large area modules and if lifetimes of at least 5 years can be achieved."

Viral nucleic acids in trivalent oral poliovirus (OPV), rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/mumps/rubella, and two rotavirus live vaccines were partially purified, randomly amplified, and pyrosequenced. Over half a million sequence reads were generated covering from 20 to 99% of the attenuated viral genomes at depths reaching up to 8,000 reads per nucleotides. Mutations and minority variants, relative to vaccine strains, not known to affect attenuation were detected in OPV, mumps virus, and varicella-zoster virus. The anticipated detection of endogenous retroviral sequences from the producer avian and primate cells was confirmed. Avian leukosis virus (ALV), previously shown to be noninfectious for humans, was present as RNA in viral particles, while simian retrovirus (SRV) was present as genetically defective DNA. Rotarix, an orally administered rotavirus vaccine, contained porcine circovirus-1 (PCV1), a highly prevalent nonpathogenic pig virus, which has not been shown to be infectious in humans. Hybridization of vaccine nucleic acids to a panmicrobial microarray confirmed the presence of endogenous retroviral and PCV1 nucleic acids. Deep sequencing and microarrays can therefore detect attenuated virus sequence changes, minority variants, and adventitious viruses and help maintain the current safety record of live-attenuated viral vaccines."

OPV has the advantages of clean, low-cost, flexibility, and the possibility of roll-to-roll production.[1–4] Currently, most of the works have been focused on polymer donor molecules using bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture and [6,6]-phenyl-C61–butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor.[5,6] Indeed, in addition to the currently better OPV performance than small molecules, polymers have the advantages for such as better film forming quality and so on.[7] However, it cannot be denied that there are disadvantages for polymer-based OPV, such as batch to batch reproducibility, difficulty of purification, and so on. In contrast, small molecules intrinsically do not have such flaws;[8] additionally, their band structures could be tuned easily with much more choices of chemical modification. Furthermore, small molecules generally have higher charge mobility and open voltages.[9,10] However, even with these advantages, small-molecule-based OPV cells have not been investigated as intensively as that of their polymer counterparts because one of the major problems for small molecules is their generally poor film quality when using the simple solution spinning process.[11] This has been hampering their performance, and indeed their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) (4%–5%)[12–18] are still significantly lower compared with that (>7%)[19–25] from polymers. It is thus expected that better PCE could be achieved when their intrinsic bad film quality and morphology in BHJ architecture could be improved combining with their other advantages. But to achieve this, careful molecule design has to be carried out to address many factors collectively, including their molar absorption, morphology compatibility with the acceptors for a better film quality, and so on."

[1–5] TC-SWNT ﬁlms are particularly attractive for photovoltaics (PV) due to their high transparency over much of the solar spectrum, excellent electrical conductivity, and the potential for inexpensive roll-to-roll processing. SWNT ﬁlms have been used, by us and others, in cadmium telluride, [6] copper indium gallium diselenide, [7] and organic PV (OPV) devices. [8–10] In several reports, SWNTelectrodes for OPV have been prepared by ﬁltering a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stabilized dispersion of SWNTs to form a thin ﬁlm. [9,10] The ﬁlm can be released by dissolution of the ﬁlter, and then transferred to a transparent substrate. [11] This so-called ‘‘transfer method’’ produces highly transparent ﬁlms with excellent conductivity, but the ﬁlms possess irregular morphologies and signiﬁcant roughness, which can lead to short-circuits and overall poor reproducibility during device fabrication. [12] Moreover, the process is not scalable. TC-SWNT ﬁlms have also been produced for optical and electrical studies by air-brush spraying using surfactant-stabilized SWNT inks. Such ﬁlms are inhomogeneous because SWNTs sprayed from surfactant solutions agglomerate on heated substrates.

In this work, we use neutron scattering to investigate the morphology of a model OPV conjugated polymer bulk heterojunction, poly[3-hexylthiophene] (P3HT), and surface-functionalized fullerene 1-(3-methyloxycarbonyl) propyl(1-phenyl [6,6]) C(61) (PCBM). These results show that P3HT and PCBM form a homogeneous structure containing crystalline P3HT and an amorphous P3HT/PCBM matrix, up to ca. 20 vol % PCBM. At 50 vol % PCBM, the samples exhibit a complex structure containing at least P3HT crystals, PCBM crystals, and a homogeneous mixture of the two. The 20 vol % PCBM samples exhibit behavior consistent with the onset of phase separation after 6 h of thermal annealing at 150 °C, but appear to be miscible at shorter annealing times. This suggests that the miscibility limit of PCBM in P3HT is near 20%. Moreover, for the 50 vol % PCBM sample, the interface roughens under thermal annealing possibly owing to the growth of PCBM crystals. These observations suggest a different morphology than is commonly presented in the literature for optimal bulk heterojunctions. We propose a novel ""rivers and streams"" morphology to describe this system, which is consistent with these scattering results and previously reported photovoltaic functionality of P3HT/PCBM bulk heterojunctions."
169,10.1002/aenm.201100234,2011,Enhanced Efficiency in Plastic Solar Cells via Energy Matched Solution Processed NiOx Interlayers,"We show enhanced efficiency and stability of a high performance organic solar cell (OPV) when the work‐function of the hole collecting indium‐tin oxide (ITO) contact, modified with a solution‐processed nickel oxide (NiOx) hole‐transport layer (HTL), is matched to the ionization potential of the donor material in a bulk‐heterojunction solar cell. Addition of the NiOx HTL to the hole collecting contact results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.7%, which is a 17.3% net increase in performance over the 5.7% PCE achieved with a poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL on ITO. The impact of these NiOx films is evaluated through optical and electronic measurements as well as device modeling. The valence and conduction band energies for the NiOx HTL are characterized in detail through photoelectron spectroscopy studies while spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to characterize the optical properties. Oxygen plasma treatment of the NiOx HTL is shown to provide superior contact properties by increasing the ITO/NiOx contact work‐function by 500 meV. Enhancement of device performance is attributed to reduction of the band edge energy offset at the ITO/NiOx interface with the poly(N‐9′‐heptadecanyl‐2,7‐carbazole‐alt‐5,5‐(4′,7′‐di‐2‐thienyl‐2′,1′,3′‐benzothidiazole) (PCDTBT):[6,6]‐phenyl‐C61 butyric acid methyl ester PCBM and [6,6]‐phenyl‐C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) active layer. A high work‐function hole collecting contact is therefore the appropriate choice for high ionization potential donor materials in order to maximize OPV performance."
170,10.1073/pnas.1919769117,2020,Highly efficient organic photovoltaics with enhanced stability through the formation of doping-induced stable interfaces,"Significance We have developed ultraflexible 3-µm-thick organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with good environmental stability and a high efficiency of over 13% by a simple postannealing process. By combining the stable polymer donor/nonfullerene small molecule acceptor blends and thermally stabilized interfaces due to doping, our OPVs achieve extremely long shelf lifetime with an estimated value of over 11.4 y. A laboratory-scale OPV module is fabricated with a sufficiently high efficiency of 11.4%, total area of 2.04 cm2, and a maximum power per unit weight of 9.90 W/g, showing a promising future for flexible OPVs as power sources for wearable electronics and soft robotics. Flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are promising power sources for wearable electronics. However, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve high efficiency as well as good stability under various stresses. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of highly efficient (efficiency, 13.2%) and stable OPVs based on nonfullerene blends by a single-step postannealing treatment. The device performance decreases dramatically after annealing at 90 °C and is fully recovered after annealing at 150 °C. Glass-encapsulated annealed OPVs show good environmental stability with 4.8% loss in efficiency after 4,736 h and an estimated T80 lifetime (80% of the initial power conversion efficiency) of over 20,750 h in the dark under ambient condition and T80 lifetime of 1,050 h at 85 °C and 30% relative humidity. This environmental stability is enabled by the synergetic effect of the stable morphology of donor/acceptor blends and thermally stabilized interfaces due to doping. Furthermore, the high efficiency and good stability are almost 100% retained in ultraflexible OPVs and minimodules which are mechanically robust and have long-term operation capability and thus are promising for future self-powered and wearable electronics."

However, there are two main restrictions: potential charge recombination in the narrow‐gap material and miscompatibility between each component. The optimized design is to employ a third component (structurally similar to the donor or acceptor) with a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level similar to the acceptor and a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level similar to the donor. In this design, enhanced absorption of the active layer and enhanced charge transfer can be realized without breaking the optimized morphology of the active layer. Herein, in order to realize this design, two new narrow‐bandgap nonfullerene acceptors with suitable energy levels and chemical structures are designed, synthesized, and employed as the third component in the donor/acceptor binary blend, which boosts the PCE of OPV to 11.6%."

Eight different research groups contributed state of the art OPV cells to be studied at Pomona College. Power conversion efficiency, fill factor, and IV curves were collected at regular intervals over six to eight months. Similarly prepared devices were measured indoors, outdoors, and after dark storage. Device architectures are compared. Cells kept indoors performed better than outdoors due to the lack of temperature and humidity extremes. Encapsulated cells performed better due to the minimal oxidation. Some devices showed steady aging but many failed catastrophically due to corrosion of electrodes not active device layers. Degradation of cells kept in dark storage was minimal over periods up to one year."

The developed R2R process is fully compatible with industrial requirements as it uses exclusively non-hazardous solvents.

174,10.1039/C6TC03344J,2016,Indoor light recycling: a new home for organic photovoltaics,"The field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has long focused on matching silicon solar cells, both in high power conversion efficiency (PCE) under solar light and broad absorption of the solar spectrum. We show that OPV devices, which have significantly lower PCEs than high-performing crystalline silicon cells when measured under the typical AM 1.5G solar standard, can surpass silicon cells with PCEs >20% measured under LED light. We highlight that the conflation of the terms “solar cell” and “photovoltaic” gives an incomplete view of the potential of many photovoltaic materials, especially organic materials. By expanding the definition and assessment of photovoltaic devices to include multiple light sources, OPVs—with their higher PCEs under indoor light and qualitative benefits of being lightweight, thin, flexible, and semi-transparent—could have a home in previously unconsidered low-power indoor applications."

In bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV devices, organic electron donor and acceptor molecules are intimately mixed within the photoactive layer. Since 2005, the power conversion efficiency of said devices has increased substantially due to insights in the underlying physical processes, device optimization, and chemical engineering of a vast number of novel light‐harvesting organic materials, either small molecules or conjugated polymers. As Nature itself has developed porphyrin chromophores for solar light to energy conversion, it seems reasonable to pursue artificial systems based on the same types of molecules. Porphyrins and their analogues have already been successfully implemented in certain device types, notably in dye‐sensitized solar cells, but they have remained largely unexplored in BHJ organic solar cells. Very recent successes do show, however, the strong (latent) prospects of porphyrinoid semiconductors as light‐harvesting and charge transporting materials in such devices. Here, an overview on the state‐of‐the‐art of porphyrin‐based solution‐processed BHJ OPV is provided and insights are given into the pathways to follow and hurdles to overcome toward further improvements of porphyrinic materials and devices."
176,10.1002/adma.201705243,2018,Ternary System with Controlled Structure: A New Strategy toward Efficient Organic Photovoltaics,"Recently, a new type of active layer with a ternary system has been developed to further enhance the performance of binary system organic photovoltaics (OPV). In the ternary OPV, almost all active layers are formed by simple ternary blend in solution, which eventually leads to the disordered bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure after a spin‐coating process. There are two main restrictions in this disordered BHJ structure to obtain higher performance OPV. One is the isolated second donor or acceptor domains. The other is the invalid metal–semiconductor contact. Herein, the concept and design of donor/acceptor/acceptor ternary OPV with more controlled structure (C‐ternary) is reported. The C‐ternary OPV is fabricated by a sequential solution process, in which the second acceptor and donor/acceptor binary blend are sequentially spin‐coated. After the device optimization, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all OPV with C‐ternary are enhanced by 14–21% relative to those with the simple ternary blend; the best PCEs are 10.7 and 11.0% for fullerene‐based and fullerene‐free solar cells, respectively. Moreover, the averaged PCE value of 10.4% for fullerene‐free solar cell measured in this study is in great agreement with the certified one of 10.32% obtained from Newport Corporation."
177,10.1073/pnas.1801187115,2018,"Thermally stable, highly efficient, ultraflexible organic photovoltaics","Significance We have developed an ultraflexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) that achieves sufficient thermal stability of up to 120 °C and a high power conversion efficiency of 10% with a total thickness of 3 μm. By combining an inherently stable donor:acceptor blend as the active layer and ultrathin substrate and barriers with excellent thermal capability, we were able to overcome the trade-offs between efficiency, stability, and device thickness. The ultraflexible and thermally stable OPV can be easily integrated into textiles through the commercially available hot-melt process without causing performance degradation, thereby presenting great potential as a ubiquitous and wearable power source in daily life. Flexible photovoltaics with extreme mechanical compliance present appealing possibilities to power Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and wearable electronic devices. Although improvement in thermal stability is essential, simultaneous achievement of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability in flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) remains challenging due to the difficulties in maintaining an optimal microstructure of the active layer under thermal stress. The insufficient thermal capability of a plastic substrate and the environmental influences cannot be fully expelled by ultrathin barrier coatings. Here, we have successfully fabricated ultraflexible OPVs with initial efficiencies of up to 10% that can endure temperatures of over 100 °C, maintaining 80% of the initial efficiency under accelerated testing conditions for over 500 hours in air. Particularly, we introduce a low-bandgap poly(benzodithiophene-cothieno[3,4-b]thiophene) (PBDTTT) donor polymer that forms a sturdy microstructure when blended with a fullerene acceptor. We demonstrate a feasible way to adhere ultraflexible OPVs onto textiles through a hot-melt process without causing severe performance degradation."
178,10.1021/jz2002259,2011,Selective Interlayers and Contacts in Organic Photovoltaic Cells.,"Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are promising solar electric energy conversion systems with impressive recent optimization of active layers. OPV optimization must now be accompanied by the development of new charge-selective contacts and interlayers. This Perspective considers the role of interface science in energy harvesting using OPVs, looking back at early photoelectrochemical (photogalvanic) energy conversion platforms, which suffered from a lack of charge carrier selectivity. We then examine recent platforms and the fundamental aspects of selective harvesting of holes and electrons at opposite contacts. For blended heterojunction OPVs, contact/interlayer design is especially critical because charge harvesting competes with recombination at these same contacts. New interlayer materials can modify contacts to both control work function and introduce selectivity and chemical compatibility with nonpolar active layers and add thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity to charge harvesting. We briefly discuss the surface and interface science required for the development of new interlayer materials and take a look ahead at the challenges yet to be faced in their optimization."
179,10.1039/C8EE00151K,2018,"Analyzing the efficiency, stability and cost potential for fullerene-free organic photovoltaics in one figure of merit","The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices continue increasing towards the 15% milestone. Recently-emerging non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have significantly accelerated this development. Most of the efficiency analyses performed previously are based on a fullerene acceptor without considering its contribution to the enhancement of photo-absorption and PCE. Moreover, the stability and cost potential of OPV devices are usually not discussed, which sometimes makes the efficiency prediction less representative for broad interest. In this work, we effectively combine the prediction of efficiencies with experimentally determined stability data to analyze and predict the commercial potential of a NFA-based OPV product. Assuming that NFAs dominate the blend near IR absorption, the efficiency limit of OPV devices is predicted to be close to 20% and is found to be insensitive to the donor bandgap. With the excellent photo-stability observed for state-of-the-art NFA-based OPV devices, it is suggested that the corresponding customized donors with promising processing properties, excellent environmental stability and low synthesis complexity be designed as realistic material pairs for large-scale production and commercialization."
180,10.1021/jacs.5b02808,2015,Energy Level Tuning of Non-Fullerene Acceptors in Organic Solar Cells,"The use of non-fullerene acceptors in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices could lead to enhanced efficiencies due to increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) and improved absorption of solar light. Here we systematically investigate planar heterojunction devices comprising peripherally substituted subphthalocyanines as acceptors and correlate the device performance with the heterojunction energetics. As a result of a balance between VOC and the photocurrent, tuning of the interface energy gap is necessary to optimize the power conversion efficiency in these devices. In addition, we explore the role of the charge transport layers in the device architecture. It is found that non-fullerene acceptors require adjusted buffer layers with aligned electron transport levels to enable efficient charge extraction, while the insertion of an exciton-blocking layer at the anode interface further boosts photocurrent generation. These adjustments result in a planar-heterojunction OPV device with an efficiency of 6.9% and a VOC above 1 V."

We fully reveal the progress of reported OPV lifetimes. Furthermore, a generic lifetime marker has been defined, which helps with gauging and comparing the performance of different architectures and materials from the perspective of device stability. Based on the analysis, conclusions are drawn on the bottlenecks for stability of device configurations and packaging techniques, as well as the current level of OPV lifetimes reported under different aging conditions. The work is summarized by discussing the development of a tool for OPV lifetime prediction and the development of more stable technologies. An online platform is introduced that will aid the process of generating statistical data on OPV lifetimes and further refinement of the lifetime prediction tool."

Manufacturing data for both single junctions and tandem junctions are presented and analyzed. Within this calculation the most expensive layers and processing steps are identified. Based on large roll-to-roll coating experiments the exact material consumptions were determined. In addition to the data for the pilot scale experiment presented here, projections to medium and large scale scenarios serve as a guide to achieve cost targets of 5 €ct per Wp in a detailed material and cost analysis. These scenarios include the replacement of cost intensive layers, as well as process optimization steps. Furthermore, the cost structures for single and tandem devices are listed in detail and discussed. In an optimized model the material costs drop below 10 € per m2 which proves that OPV is a competitive alternative to established power generation technologies."
183,10.1111/risa.13622,2020,Updated Characterization of Outbreak Response Strategies for 2019–2029: Impacts of Using a Novel Type 2 Oral Poliovirus Vaccine Strain,"Delays in achieving the global eradication of wild poliovirus transmission continue to postpone subsequent cessation of all oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use. Countries must stop OPV use to end all cases of poliomyelitis, including vaccine‐associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and cases caused by vaccine‐derived polioviruses (VDPVs). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) coordinated global cessation of all type 2 OPV (OPV2) use in routine immunization in 2016 but did not successfully end the transmission of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), and consequently continues to use type 2 OPV (OPV2) for outbreak response activities. Using an updated global poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model, we characterize outbreak response options for 2019–2029 related to responding to VDPV2 outbreaks with a genetically stabilized novel OPV (nOPV2) strain or with the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2). Given uncertainties about the properties of nOPV2, we model different assumptions that appear consistent with the evidence on nOPV2 to date. Using nOPV2 to respond to detected cases may reduce the expected VDPV and VAPP cases and the risk of needing to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization compared to mOPV2 use for outbreak response. The actual properties, availability, and use of nOPV2 will determine its effects on type 2 poliovirus transmission in populations. Even with optimal nOPV2 performance, countries and the GPEI would still likely need to restart OPV2 use in routine immunization in OPV‐using countries if operational improvements in outbreak response to stop the transmission of cVDPV2s are not implemented effectively."

Among the three wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. This decline is attributable primarily to use of the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in national routine immunization schedules and mass vaccination campaigns. The success and safety record of OPV use is offset by the rare emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), whose genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or circulation (2). Circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) can emerge in areas with low immunization coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. In addition, immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can emerge in persons with primary immunodeficiencies and can replicate and be excreted for years. This report presents data on VDPVs detected during January 2017-June 2018 and updates previous VDPV summaries (3). During this reporting period, new cVDPV outbreaks were detected in five countries. Fourteen newly identified persons in nine countries were found to excrete iVDPVs. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), isolates that cannot be classified definitively, were found among immunocompetent persons and environmental samples in seven countries."

Here, excitonic dissociation pathways in the high‐performance, low bandgap “in‐chain donor–acceptor” polymer PTB7 by transient optical absorption (TA) spectroscopy in solutions, neat films, and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PTB7:PC71BM (phenyl‐C71‐butyric acid methyl ester) films are investigated. The dynamics and energetics of the exciton and intra‐/intermolecular charge separated states are characterized. A distinct, dynamic, spectral red‐shift of the polymer cation is observed in the BHJ films in TA spectra following electron transfer from the polymer to PC71BM, which can be attributed to the time evolution of the hole–electron spatial separation after exciton splitting. Effects of film morphology are also investigated and compared to those of conjugated homopolymers. The enhanced charge separation along the PTB7 alternating donor–acceptor backbone is understood by intramolecular charge separation through polarized, delocalized excitons that lower the exciton binding energy. Consequently, ultrafast charge separation and transport along these polymer backbones reduce carrier recombination in these largely amorphous films. This charge separation mechanism explains why higher degrees of PCBM intercalation within BHJ matrices enhances exciton splitting and charge transport, and thus increase OPV performance. This study proposes new guidelines for OPV materials development."

NSEs of oral polio vaccine (OPV) were not examined. If OPV vaccination campaigns reduce the mortality rate, it would suggest beneficial NSEs. Setting Between 2002 and 2014, Guinea-Bissau had 15 general OPV campaigns and other campaigns with OPV plus vitamin A supplementation (VAS), VAS-only, MV, and H1N1 vaccine. In this period, we conducted seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mortality as main outcome. Methods Within these RCTs, we assessed whether the mortality rate was lower after-campaign than before-campaign. We used Cox models with age as underlying time and further adjusted for low birth-weight, season and time trend in mortality. We calculated the adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR) for after-campaign vs before-campaign. Results The mortality rate was lower after OPV-only campaigns than before, the MRR being 0.81 (95% CI = 0.68–0.95). With each additional dose of campaign-OPV the mortality rate declined further (MRR = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79–0.96) per dose) (test for trend, p = 0.005). No other type of campaign had similar beneficial effects. Depending on initial age and with follow-up to 3 years of age, the number needed to treat with campaign-OPV-only to save one life was between 68 and 230 children. Conclusion Bissau had no case of polio infection so the results suggest that campaign-OPV has beneficial NSEs. Discontinuation of OPV-campaigns in low-income countries may affect general child mortality levels negatively."
190,10.1002/adfm.201801542,2018,Determining the Dielectric Constants of Organic Photovoltaic Materials Using Impedance Spectroscopy,"The photovoltaic and electrical properties of organic semiconductors are characterized by their low dielectric constant, which leads to the formation of polarons and Frenkel excitons. The low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors has been suggested to be significantly influential in geminate and bimolecular recombination losses in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, despite the critical attention that the dielectric constant has received in literature discussions, there has not yet been a thorough study of the dielectric constant in common organic semiconductors and how it changes when blended. In fact, there have been some inconsistent and contradictory reports on such dielectric constants, making it difficult to identify trends. Herein, at first a detailed explanation of a specific methodology to determine the dielectric constant in OPV materials with impedance spectroscopy is provided, including guidelines for possible experimental pitfalls. Using this methodology, the analysis for the dielectric constant of 17 common neat organic semiconductors is carried out. Furthermore, the relationship between the dielectric constant and blend morphology are studied and determined. It is found that the dielectric constant of a blend system can be very accurately predicted solely based on the dielectric constants of the neat materials, scaled by their respective weight ratios in the blend film."

With a binary bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) of PCDTBT:PC71BM organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.5% under indoor light sources (300 lux from fluorescence tube) was achieved. However, with a ternary BHJ cell of PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM, the PCE can be enhanced to 20.8%. FFs are the primarily improved in these devices. Transport and absorption measurements indicate the origins of the improvements of OPV performance: the ternary BHJ films exhibit enhanced hole mobilities and reduced Urbach energies, indicating that the blending of the PDTSTPD component passivates shallow traps near the band edges of the BHJ films."
192,10.1002/aenm.201700084,2017,Quantitative Morphology–Performance Correlations in Organic Solar Cells: Insights from Soft X‐Ray Scattering,"Organic/polymer semiconductors provide unique possibilities and flexibility in tailoring their optoelectronic properties to match specific application demands. One of the key factors contributing to the rapid and continuous progress of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is the control and optimization of photoactive‐layer morphology. The impact of morphology on photovoltaic parameters has been widely observed. However, the highly complex and multilength‐scale morphology often formed in efficient OPV devices consisting of compositionally similar components impose obstacles to conventional morphological characterizations. In contrast, due to the high compositional and orientational sensitivity, resonant soft X‐ray scattering (R‐SoXS), and related techniques lead to tremendous progress of characterization and comprehension regarding the complex mesoscale morphology in OPVs. R‐SoXS is capable of quantifying the domain characteristics, and polarized soft X‐ray scattering (P‐SoXS) provides quantitative information on orientational ordering. These morphological parameters strongly correlate the fill factor (FF), open‐circuit voltage (Voc), as well as short‐circuit current (Jsc) in a wider range of OPV devices, including recent record‐efficiency polymer:fullerene solar cells and 12%‐efficiency fullerene‐free OPVs. This progress report will delineate the soft X‐ray scattering methodology and its future challenges to characterize and understand functional organic materials and provide a non‐exhaustive overview of R‐SoXS characterization and its implication to date."
193,10.1002/aenm.201700465,2017,Evaluation of Electron Donor Materials for Solution‐Processed Organic Solar Cells via a Novel Figure of Merit,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology offers many advantages, although no commercial applications have been achieved after more than a decade of intensive research and development. Several challenges have yet to be overcome including high power conversion efficiency (PCE), good processability, low cost, and excellent long‐term stability, and so on. In this article, these fundamental challenges are significantly addressed by surveying and analyzing a new merit factor for material applied accessibility containing three parameters: synthetic complexity, device efficiency, and photostability. Thirty‐five donor small molecules are introduced to assess their synthetic accessibility. Furthermore, the PCEs and device photostability of these molecules are carried out, and further measured under one sun illumination within 200 h, respectively. Combining with the characteristics of these three factors, investigated molecules are ranked according to an industrial figure of merit (i‐FOM), while some guidelines for the material design and synthesis are given. It is suggested that a PCE of >14% and an i‐FOM of >20% via active material engineering are realistic for possible industry future of OPV. Along with the systematic study, it is believed that this i‐FOM can be taken into consideration at an early stage of molecular design and provides valuable insight for efficient evaluation of photovoltaic materials for possible commercial applications."

We present a comparative study of the stability of polymer/fullerene bilayers using two common OPV polymer donors poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, and poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)], PCDTBT, and four fullerene acceptors phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, [60]PCBM bis-adduct, and indene C60 bis-adduct. Using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry to characterize the quasi-steady state behavior of the films, we find that the polymer glass transition temperature (Tg) is critical to the bilayer stability, with no significant changes occurring below Tg of the high ..."
195,10.1002/adfm.201901171,2019,Highly Efficient Indoor Organic Photovoltaics with Spectrally Matched Fluorinated Phenylene‐Alkoxybenzothiadiazole‐Based Wide Bandgap Polymers,"The unique electro‐optical features of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have led to their use in applications that focus on indoor energy harvesters. Various adoptable photoactive materials with distinct spectral absorption windows offer enormous potential for their use under various indoor light sources. An in‐depth study on the performance optimization of indoor OPVs is conducted using various photoactive materials with different spectral absorption ranges. Among the materials, the fluorinated phenylene‐alkoxybenzothiadiazole‐based wide bandgap polymer—poly[(5,6‐bis(2‐hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole‐4,7‐diyl)‐alt‐(5,50‐(2,5‐difluoro‐1,4‐phenylene)bis(thiophen‐2‐yl))] (PDTBTBz‐2Fanti)‐contained photoactive layer—exhibits a superior spectrum matching with indoor lights, particularly a light‐emitting diode (LED), which results in an excellent power absorption ratio. These optical properties contribute to the state‐of‐the‐art performance of the PDTBTBz‐2Fanti:[6,6]‐phenyl‐C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)‐based OPV with an unprecedented high power‐conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% under a 1000 lx LED. Finally, its indoor photovoltaic performance is observed to be better than that of an interdigitated‐back‐contact‐based silicon photovoltaic (PCE of 16.3%)."
196,10.1039/c3cs60406c,2014,Oligo(phenylenevinylene) hybrids and self-assemblies: versatile materials for excitation energy transfer.,"Oligo(phenylenevinylene)s (OPVs) are extensively investigated π-conjugated molecules that exhibit absorption and fluorescence in the UV-Vis spectral region, which can be widely tuned by chemical functionalisation and external control (e.g. solvent, temperature, pH). Further modulation of the optoelectronic properties of OPVs is possible by supramolecular aggregation, primarily driven by hydrogen bonding or π-stacking interactions. In recent years, extensive research work has been accomplished in exploiting the unique combination of the structural and electronic properties of OPVs, most of which has been targeted at the preparation of molecules and materials featuring photoinduced energy transfer. This review intends to offer an overview of the multicomponent arrays and self-assembled materials based on OPV which have been designed to undergo energy transfer by means of a thorough choice of excitation donor-acceptor partners. We present a few selected examples of photoactive dyads and triads containing organic moieties (e.g. fullerene, phenanthroline) as well as coordination compounds (Cu(I) complexes). We then focus more extensively on self-assembled materials containing suitably functionalised OPVs that lead to hydrogen bonded aggregates, helical structures, gels, nanoparticles, vesicles, mesostructured organic-inorganic hybrid films, functionalised nanoparticles and quantum dots. In most cases, these materials exhibit luminescence whose colour and intensity is related to the efficiency and direction of the energy transfer processes."

The mesh patterning can be accurately controlled in order to significantly enhance the electrode transparency, with a subsequent slight increase in the sheet resistance, and therefore improve the tradeoff between transparency and conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers. In particular, rGO films with an initial transparency of ≈20% are patterned, resulting in rGOMMs films with a ≈59% transmittance and a sheet resistance of ≈565 Ω sq−1, that is significantly lower than the resistance of ≈780 Ω sq−1, exhibited by the pristine rGO films at the same transparency. As a proof‐of‐concept application, rGOMMs are used as the transparent electrodes in flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, achieving power conversion efficiency of 3.05%, the highest ever reported for flexible OPV devices incorporating solution‐processed graphene‐based electrodes. The controllable and highly reproducible laser‐induced patterning of rGO hold enormous promise for both rigid and flexible large‐scale organic electronic devices, eliminating the lag between graphene‐based and indium–tin oxide electrodes, while providing conductivity and transparency tunability for next generation flexible electronics."

The current state of OPV research is summarized and the advantages of PHJs as models for exploring the relationship between organic interfaces and device characteristics described. The preparation methods and the characterization of PHJ structures to provide key points for the appropriate handling of PHJs. Next, we describe the effects of the donor/acceptor interface on each photoelectric conversion process are reviewed by examining various PHJ systems to clarify what is currently known and not known. Finally, it is discussed how we the knowledge obtained by studies of PHJs can be used to overcome the current limits of OPV efficiency."
199,10.1063/1.4913697,2015,Inkjet printed silver nanowire network as top electrode for semi-transparent organic photovoltaic devices,"A method for direct inkjet printing of silver nanowire (Ag NW) to form transparent conductive network as the top electrode for inverted semi-transparent organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) was developed. The highest power conversion efficiency of the poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61–butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) based OPV was achieved to be 2.71% when the top electrode was formed by 7 times of printing. In general, devices with printed Ag NW top electrode had similar open-circuit voltage (VOC, around 0.60 V) but lower fill factor (FF, 0.33–0.54) than that of device with thermally deposited Ag opaque electrode (reference device). Both FF and short-circuit current density (JSC), however, were found to be increasing with the increase of printing times (3, 5, and 7), which could be partially attributed to the improved conductivity of Ag NW network electrodes. The solvent effect on device performances was studied carefully by comparing the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of different devices. Th..."
200,10.1002/ADFM.200901107,2010,Efficiency Enhancement in Organic Photovoltaic Cells: Consequences of Optimizing Series Resistance,"Here, means to enhance power conversion efficiency (PCE or η) in bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells by optimizing the series resistance (Rs)—also known as the cell internal resistance—are studied. It is shown that current state‐of‐the‐art BHJ OPVs are approaching the limit for which efficiency can be improved via Rs reduction alone. This evaluation addresses OPVs based on a poly(3‐hexylthiophene):6,6‐phenyl C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) active layer, as well as future high‐efficiency OPVs (η > 10%). A diode‐based modeling approach is used to assess changes in Rs. Given that typical published P3HT:PCBM test cells have relatively small areas (∼0.1 cm2), the analysis is extended to consider efficiency losses for larger area cells and shows that the transparent anode conductivity is then the dominant materials parameter affecting Rs efficiency losses. A model is developed that uses cell sizes and anode conductivities to predict current–voltage response as a function of resistive losses. The results show that the losses due to Rs remain minimal until relatively large cell areas (>0.1 cm2) are employed. Finally, Rs effects on a projected high‐efficiency OPV scenario are assessed, based on the goal of cell efficiencies >10%. Here, Rs optimization effects remain modest; however, there are now more pronounced losses due to cell size, and it is shown how these losses can be mitigated by using higher conductivity anodes."
201,10.1021/acsami.9b00018,2019,High-Performance Organic Energy-Harvesting Devices and Modules for Self-Sustainable Power Generation under Ambient Indoor Lighting Environments.,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) that perform more efficiently under artificial indoor lighting conditions than they do under sunlight are attracting growing interest as they can potentially serve as ambient energy harvesters for powering low-power electronics and portable devices for the Internet of Things. Herein, solution-processed small-molecule OPVs are demonstrated to exhibit high power conversion efficiencies exceeding 16% under white LED illumination, delivering high output power densities of up to 12.4 and 65.3 μW cm-2 at 200 and 1000 lx, respectively. Increasing the open-circuit voltage ( Voc) of OPVs is a critical factor for achieving higher indoor photovoltaic performance. Toward real applications, this small-molecule OPV system is adopted to fabricate six series-connected modules with an active area of ∼10 cm2 that are capable of generating a high output power surpassing 100 μW and a high Voc of over 4.2 V even under dimly lit indoor conditions of 200 lx. These results indicate that OPVs are promising as indoor electric power sources for self-sustainable electronic devices."
202,10.1063/1.1544413,2003,"Comparing organic to inorganic photovoltaic cells: Theory, experiment, and simulation","Charge carriers are photogenerated with very different spatial distributions in conventional inorganic photovoltaic (IPV) cells and in organic photovoltaic (OPV or excitonic) cells. This leads to a fundamental, and often overlooked, mechanistic difference between them. Carriers are generated primarily at the exciton-dissociating heterointerface in OPV cells, resulting in the production of electrons in one phase and holes in the other—the two carrier types are thus already separated across the interface upon photogeneration in OPV cells, giving rise to a powerful chemical potential energy gradient ∇μhv that promotes the photovoltaic effect. This occurs also in high-surface-area OPV cells, although their description is more complex. In contrast, both carrier types are photogenerated together throughout the bulk in IPV cells: ∇μhv then drives both electrons and holes in the same direction through the same phase; efficient carrier separation therefore requires a built-in equilibrium electrical potential energ..."
203,10.1021/ja903100p,2009,Electroluminescence from charge transfer states in polymer solar cells.,In this article we report the weak but omnipresent electroluminescence (EL) from several types of organic polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells biased in the forward direction. The light emitted from blends of some commonly used polymers and the fullerene molecule is significantly different from that of any of the pure materials comprising the blend. The lower energy of the blend EL is found to correlate with both the voltage onset of emission and the open-circuit voltage of the photovoltaic cell under solar illumination. We accordingly interpret the emission to originate from interfacial charge transfer state recombination and emphasize EL as a very valuable tool to characterize the charge transfer state present in donor/acceptor organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.
204,10.1093/cid/ciaa1351,2020,National immunisation campaigns with oral polio vaccine may reduce all-cause mortality: An analysis of 13 years of demographic surveillance data from an urban African area.,"BACKGROUND
Between 2002-2014, Guinea-Bissau had 17 national campaigns with oral polio vaccine (OPV) as well as campaigns with vitamin A supplementation (VAS), measles vaccine (MV), and H1N1-influenza vaccine. We examined the impact of these campaigns on child survival.


METHODS
We examined the mortality rate between day 1 and 3 years of age of all children in the study area. We used Cox models with age as underlying time to calculate adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) between ""after-campaign"" mortality and ""before-campaign"" mortality, adjusted for temporal change in mortality and stratified for season at risk.


RESULTS
Mortality was lower after OPV-only campaigns than before, the MRR for after-campaign vs. before-campaign being 0.75 (95% CI=0.67-0.85). Other campaigns did not have similar effects, the MRRs being 1.22 (1.04-1.44) for OPV+VAS campaigns, 1.39 (1.20-1.61) for VAS-only campaigns, 1.32 (1.09-1.60) for MV-with-VAS campaigns, and 1.13 (0.86-1.49) for the H1N1 campaign. Thus, all other campaigns differed significantly from the effect of OPV-only campaigns. Effects did not differ for trivalent, bivalent, or monovalent strains of OPV. With each additional campaign of OPV-only, the mortality rate declined further (MRR=0.86 (0.81-0.92) per campaign). With follow-up to 3 years of age, the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one life with campaign-OPV-only was 50 neonates.


CONCLUSION
OPV campaigns can have a much larger effect on child survival than otherwise assumed. Stopping OPV campaigns in low-income countries as part of the endgame for polio infection may increase child mortality."

Herein, the main approaches employing organic semiconductor‐based devices toward solar H2 generation via water splitting are compared and performance demonstrations are reviewed. OPV‐biased water electrolysis is seen to advance significantly with the development of the tandem OPV device and the optimization of operating potential and redox catalysts. This approach now exceeds 6% solar‐to‐hydrogen conversion efficiency while over 10% is reasonably feasible. By contrast, while the direct water splitting by an organic semiconductor in a photo‐electrochemical cell has attractive advantages, increasing the performance remains a challenge. Photocathodes employing a bulk‐heterojunction have been optimized to give 7–8 mA cm−2 water reduction photocurrent under standard conditions, but photoanodes remain <1 mA cm−2, and robustness remains a critical issue. However, recent investigations into the direct organic semiconductor/electrolyte interface have brought important insights into free charge generation, the nature of the semiconductor/catalyst interface, and the stability of organic photoelectrodes. Outlooks toward advancing both approaches are discussed."

Recently, great advances have been achieved in the development of novel photovoltaic materials and device structures, and the power conversion efficiencies can now reach 7.7%. In this review we summarize the most recent developments in conjugated polymers for high-efficiency OPV devices.

In this Progress Report we summarize and discuss comprehensively the advances made so far for applications of graphene in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, including that for transparent electrodes, active layers and interfaces layer in OPV. It is concluded that graphene may very likely play a major role in new developments/improvements in OPVs. The future studies for this area are proposed to focus on the following: i) improving the conductivity without comprising the transparency as a transparent electrode material; ii) controlling the sheet sizes, band structure and surface morphology for use as a electron acceptor material, and iii) controlling and improving the functionalization and compatibility with other materials as interface layer material."
208,10.1002/er.5664,2020,Overview of printing and coating techniques in the production of organic photovoltaic cells,"The organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) is composed of multiple layers, and some printing and coating techniques are more suitable than others for a certain type of layer. This paper aims to characterize and compare the most relevant coating and printing techniques that can be used in the manufacture of OPVs. Extensive bibliographic research was carried out on articles published from 1998 to 2020 to identify various aspects OPV, such as the principle of operation, advantages, disadvantages, and which layers can be printed by each technique. The results show that the most used method for the processing of OPVs is spin‐coating. In the studies found, rotation was used to coat the active layer, the electron transport layer, and the hole transport layer. The techniques of pad printing, casting, and meniscus are considered useful in the processing of the active layer. Regarding the deposition of the active layer, hole transport layer, electron transport layer, and anode, the rotogravure, crack matrix, spraying, and brushing techniques were satisfactory. Flexography has been used to form the active layer, electron transport layer, and anode. Screen printing, inkjet printing, and knife/blade coating were used in the processing of the active layer, hole transport layer, electron transport layer, anode, and cathode. All the double slot die coating, curtain coating, and slide coating allows simultaneous processing of multiple layers. Techniques compatible with roll‐to‐roll processing are more likely to be at the center of OPVs in the future, thus making solar photovoltaic technology more competitive."
209,10.1039/c9ta11752k,2020,Novel wide-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors for efficient tandem organic solar cells,"The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is currently limited by the lack of suitable wide-bandgap materials for the front-cell. Here, two new acceptor molecules, namely IDTA and IDTTA, with optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.90 and 1.75 eV, respectively, are synthesized and studied for application in OPVs. When PBDB-T is used as the donor polymer, single-junction cells with PCE of 7.4%, for IDTA, and 10.8%, for IDTTA, are demonstrated. The latter value is the highest PCE reported to date for wide-bandgap (Eoptg ≥ 1.7 eV) bulk-heterojunction OPV cells. The higher carrier mobility in IDTTA-based cells leads to improved charge extraction and higher fill-factor than IDTA-based devices. Moreover, IDTTA-based OPVs show significantly improved shelf-lifetime and thermal stability, both critical for any practical applications. With the aid of optical-electrical device modelling, we combined PBDB-T:IDTTA, as the front-cell, with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, as the back-cell, to realize tandem OPVs with open circuit voltage of 1.66 V, short circuit current of 13.6 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 15%; in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. The work highlights IDTTA as a promising wide-bandgap acceptor for high-performance tandem OPVs."
210,10.1002/aenm.201702816,2018,The Impact of Local Morphology on Organic Donor/Acceptor Charge Transfer States,"A major breakthrough in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) was the development of the donor/acceptor heterojunction that aids in separating Coulombically bound excitons that are generated upon photoabsorption. Additionally, bound charge transfer (CT) states that result from the exchange of charge carriers across the donor/acceptor interface are believed to play an important role in charge generation. Though organic thin films are often disordered, enhancements to the local structural order at the donor/acceptor interface have recently been shown to greatly influence CT state energetics and the charge generation process. In this progress report, recent efforts to understand the role that donor/acceptor morphology plays in the behavior of CT states and the resulting implications on OPV function are presented. It is aimed to provide a survey of different experimental approaches and to present a balanced examination of current interpretations of key results, and to offer best practices for the fabrication and study of morphologically tunable donor/acceptor CT states."
211,10.1021/ja304986t,2012,Chemical molecule-induced light-activated system for anticancer and antifungal activities.,"Except for chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) as new therapy modality is already in wide clinic use for the treatment of various diseases. The major bottleneck of this technique is the requirement of outer light source, which always limits effective application of PDT to the lesions in deeper tissue. Here, we first report a new modality for treating cancer and microbial infections, which is activated by chemical molecules instead of outer light irradiation. In this system, in situ bioluminescence of luminol can be absorbed by a cationic oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (OPV) that acts as the photosensitizer through bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) process. The excited OPV sensitizes oxygen molecule in the surroundings to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill the adjacent cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and pathogenic microbes. By avoiding the use of light irradiation, this work opens a new therapy modality to tumor and pathogen infections."
212,10.1002/advs.201800434,2018,Current Status of Outdoor Lifetime Testing of Organic Photovoltaics,"Performance degradation is one of the key obstacles limiting the commercial application of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The assessment of OPV stability and lifetime are usually based on simulated degradation experiments conducted under indoor conditions, whereas photovoltaic devices experience different environmental conditions under outdoor operation. Besides the intrinsic degradation of OPV devices due to the evolution of optoelectronic and morphological structure during long‐term operation, outdoor environmental changes can impose extra stresses and accelerate the degradation of OPV modules. Although outdoor studies on long‐term OPV stability are restricted by the long data collection times, they provide direct information on OPV stability under mixed degradation stresses and are therefore invaluable from the point of view of both research and practical application. Here, an overview of the current status of outdoor lifetime studies of OPVs is provided. After a summary of device lifetime extrapolated from indoor studies, outdoor lifetime testing platforms are introduced and the operational lifetime of various OPV devices are reviewed. The influence of climate and weather parameters on device performance and burn‐in phenomena observed during the degradation of OPVs is then discussed. Finally, an outlook and directions for future research in this field are suggested."

Because World Health Organization–prequalified BCG-Denmark was not available in India, we conducted 2 randomized trials to test whether BCG-Russia alone or with oral polio vaccine (OPV) has similar effects to BCG-Denmark. Methods: We randomized neonates weighing <2000 g to a control group that was not vaccinated before 28 days of age or to receive either BCG-Russia alone (first trial) or BCG-Russia with OPV (second trial) soon after birth. We performed intention-to-treat analysis using Cox hazards models with age as the underlying time and adjusted for weight, sex and inborn versus outborn status. Results: Administration of BCG-Russia alone had no effect on neonatal mortality (to 28 days of age): 15.6% of 1537 infants died in the BCG-Russia group and 16.1% of 1535 died in the control group; the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80–1.13]. Administration of BCG-Russia with OPV also had no effect on neonatal mortality: 18.0% of 1103 infants died in the BCG-OPV group and 17.6% of 1104 died in the control group; the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.83–1.23). The adjusted hazard ratio for the 2 trials combined was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.85–1.11). Conclusions: BCG-Russia with or without OPV had no effect on neonatal mortality. It is important to determine which strains of BCG have the greatest specific effects (on tuberculosis) and nonspecific effects (on infections other than tuberculosis) in high-mortality regions."
215,10.1039/C7TA06808E,2017,High dielectric constant conjugated materials for organic photovoltaics,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) offer a low-cost and esthetically appealing thin-film alternative to the well-known silicon-based solar panels, opening up new applications and markets. A substantial increase in power conversion efficiency (to over 13%) has been achieved for these organic solar cells over the last decade, largely as a result of intensive research on novel electron donor and acceptor materials, combined in a bulk heterojunction device structure. Nevertheless, it is clear that further progress is required to be competitive with more efficient traditional and other emerging thin-film PV technologies. At this moment, the device performance is (among others) limited by the low dielectric constants (er = ∼3 to 4) of the state of the art photoactive organic materials. Important loss processes inherently connected to the strong coulombic interactions within low-permittivity organic materials can be suppressed through the enhancement of er. High dielectric constant materials show lower exciton binding energies and hence recombination can be reduced, improving the charge carrier extraction efficiency. Despite these promising prospects, limited research has been devoted to the development and OPV integration of high-dielectric organic semiconductors. In here, an overview is provided of the approaches applied so far to enhance er of organic compounds specifically developed for OPV purposes, commenting on the insights obtained and the challenges remaining."
216,10.1021/acsami.6b03453,2016,Toward Efficient Thick Active PTB7 Photovoltaic Layers Using Diphenyl Ether as a Solvent Additive.,"The development of thick organic photovoltaics (OPV) could increase absorption in the active layer and ease manufacturing constraints in large-scale solar panel production. However, the efficiencies of most low-bandgap OPVs decrease substantially when the active layers exceed ∼100 nm in thickness (because of low crystallinity and a short exciton diffusion length). Herein, we report the use of solvent additive diphenyl ether (DPE) that facilitates the fabrication of thick (180 nm) active layers and triples the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of conventional thienothiophene-co-benzodithiophene polymer (PTB7)-based OPVs from 1.75 to 6.19%. These results demonstrate a PCE 20% higher than those of conventional (PTB7)-based OPV devices using 1,8-diiodooctane. Morphology studies reveal that DPE promotes the formation of nanofibrillar networks and ordered packing of PTB7 in the active layer that facilitate charge transport over longer distances. We further demonstrate that DPE improves the fill factor and photocurrent collection by enhancing the overall optical absorption, reducing the series resistance, and suppressing bimolecular recombination."

Identifying the specific factors in developing countries that decrease and/or compromise the protection that rotavirus vaccines offer, could lead to a path for designing new strategies for the vaccines’ improvement. Areas covered: We accessed PubMed to identify rotavirus vaccine performance studies (i.e., efficacy, effectiveness and immunogenicity) and correlated performance with several risk factors. Here, we review the factors that might contribute to the low vaccine efficacy, including passive transfer of maternal rotavirus antibodies, rotavirus seasonality, oral polio vaccine (OPV) administered concurrently, microbiome composition and concomitant enteric pathogens, malnutrition, environmental enteropathy, HIV, and histo blood group antigens. Expert commentary: We highlight two major factors that compromise rotavirus vaccines’ efficacy: the passive transfer of rotavirus IgG antibodies to infants and the co-administration of rotavirus vaccines with OPV. We also identify other potential risk factors that require further research because the data about their interference with the efficacy of rotavirus vaccines are inconclusive and at times conflicting."
218,10.1039/c4nr01539h,2014,Improving the efficiency of organic photovoltaics by tuning the work function of graphene oxide hole transporting layers.,"A facile, fast, non-destructive and roll-to-roll compatible photochemical method for simultaneous partial reduction and doping of graphene oxide (GO) films through ultraviolet laser irradiation in the presence of a Cl2 precursor gas is demonstrated. The photochemical chlorinated GO-Cl films were fully characterized by XPS and Raman measurements, in which grafting of chloride to the edges and the basal plane of GO was confirmed. By tuning the laser exposure time, it is possible to control the doping and reduction levels and therefore to tailor the work function (WF) of the GO-Cl layers from 4.9 eV to a maximum value of 5.23 eV. These WF values match with the HOMO level of most polymer donors employed in OPV devices. Furthermore, high efficiency poly(2,7-carbazole) derivative (PCDTBT):fullerene derivative (PC71BM) based OPVs with GO-Cl as the hole transporting layer (HTL) were demonstrated with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.56% which is 17.35% and 19.48% higher than that of the pristine GO and PEDOT:PSS based OPV devices, respectively. The performance enhancement was attributed to more efficient hole transportation due to the energy level matching between the GO-Cl and the polymer donor."

220,10.1002/aenm.201502230,2016,Temperature Dependence of Ideality Factors in Organic Solar Cells and the Relation to Radiative Efficiency,"The value and temperature dependence of the ideality factor provides essential information about the dominant recombination route in solar cells. This study presents experimental results of accurate ideality factor determination for representative organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) evaluated at different temperatures over a large current density regime. It is noted that standard dark I–V curves strongly deviate from those obtained by evaluations based on short circuit current density (J SC)–open circuit voltage (V OC) pairs. This is attributed to the applied external voltage in a dark I–V measurement not being representative of internal chemical potential, particularly at lower temperatures. Complementary electroluminescence measurements attest that the current density dependence of the ability of the solar cell to emit light is better correlated to the series resistance free ideality factor. For the studied set of OPV devices it is observed that the ideality factors are quite low, and with very weak temperature dependence. The J SC–V OC method to determine ideality factors further allows good estimates of activation energies as well as recombination current prefactors J 00. The findings imply that the principal OPV non‐radiative recombination mechanism is not recombination of free carriers with trapped carriers in an exponential density of tail states as previously reported."

They exhibit good power conversion efficiencies and in principle they can be fabricated with lower energy consumption than many more established technologies. To improve the efficiency and long‐term stability of PSC, organic molecules are frequently used as “interlayers.” Interlayers are thin layers or monolayers of organic molecules that modify a specific interface in the solar cell. Here, the latest progress in the use of interlayers to optimize the performance of PSC is reviewed. Where appropriate interesting examples from the field of organic photovoltaics (OPV) are also presented as there are many similarities in the types of interlayers that are used in PSC and OPV. The review is organized into three parts. The first part focuses on why organic molecule interlayers improve the performance of the solar cells. The second section discusses commonly used molecular interlayers. In the last part, different approaches to make thin and uniform interlayers are discussed."

Among various semiconducting structural platforms, 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) π-systems have recently attracted attention for use in organic thin-films transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). This Review article provides an overview of the developments in the past 10 years on the structural design and synthesis of BODIPY-based organic semiconductors and their application in OTFT/OPV devices. The findings summarized and discussed here include the most recent breakthroughs in BODIPYs with record-high charge carrier mobilities and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The most up-to-date design rationales and discussions providing a strong understanding of structure-property-function relationships in BODIPY-based semiconductors are presented. Thus, this review is expected to inspire new research for future materials developments/applications in this family of molecules."
223,10.1039/C3EE42653J,2013,Life cycle analyses of organic photovoltaics: a review,"This paper reviews the available life cycle analysis (LCA) literature on organic photovoltaics (OPVs). This branch of OPV research has focused on the environmental impact of single-junction bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells using a P3HT/PC60BM active layer blend processed on semi-industrial pilot lines in ambient surroundings. The environmental impact was found to be strongly decreasing through continuous innovation of the manufacturing procedures. The current top performing cell regarding environmental performance has a cumulative energy demand of 37.58 MJp m−2 and an energy payback time in the order of months for cells having 2% efficiency, thereby rendering OPV cells one of the best performing PV technologies from an environmental point of view. Nevertheless, we find that LCA literature is lagging behind on the main body of OPV literature due to the lack of readily available input data. Still, LCA research has led us to believe that in the quest for higher efficiencies, environmental sustainability is being disregarded on the materials' side. Hence, we advise the scientific community to take the progress made on environmental sustainability aspects of OPV preparations into account not only because standard procedures put a bigger strain on the environment, but also because these methods may not be transferrable to an industrial process. Consequently, we recommend policy makers to subsidize research that bridges the gaps between fundamental materials research, stability, and scalability given that these constraints have to be fulfilled simultaneously if OPVs are ever to be successful on the market. Additionally, environmental sustainability will have to keep on being monitored to steer future developments in the right direction."
224,10.1088/0957-4484/21/50/505204,2010,Doped graphene electrodes for organic solar cells,"In this work graphene sheets grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with controlled numbers of layers were used as transparent electrodes in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. It was found that for devices with pristine graphene electrodes, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is comparable to their counterparts with indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. Nevertheless, the chances for failure in OPVs with pristine graphene electrodes are higher than for those with ITO electrodes, due to the surface wetting challenge between the hole-transporting layer and the graphene electrodes. Various alternative routes were investigated and it was found that AuCl3 doping on graphene can alter the graphene surface wetting properties such that a uniform coating of the hole-transporting layer can be achieved and device success rate can be increased. Furthermore, the doping both improves the conductivity and shifts the work function of the graphene electrode, resulting in improved overall PCE performance of the OPV devices. This work brings us one step further toward the future use of graphene transparent electrodes as a replacement for ITO."
225,10.1039/C6MH00570E,2017,Porous organic polymers as emerging new materials for organic photovoltaic applications: current status and future challenges,"Porous organic polymers are materials with covalently bonded (hydro)thermally stable backbones exhibiting high and accessible surface areas, and properties which are intriguing in the field of (opto)electronics. Especially in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), the electron rich backbone of this class of materials provides exceptional light absorption properties for improved charge formation/separation. Particularly for devices operating via bulk heterojunctions, the rigid open voids along the porous skeleton are rather interesting for improved phase separation and act as an ideal host to the prospective acceptors. Furthermore, their high dimensional geometry allows them to transport electrons/holes independent of orientation issues. However, the non-soluble nature of this class of materials limits their processability for forming uniform films, which is essential for device fabrication. In this review, a brief overview on the reported OPV devices fabricated by applying porous organic polymers in the active layer with the corresponding methods used for film formation will be presented, which will be followed by a discussion regarding possible improvements on the film formation methods and suggestions upon enhancement of the structural/electronic feasibility of the porous backbone."
226,10.1021/ACS.CHEMMATER.7B00067,2017,Mixing Behavior in Small Molecule:Fullerene Organic Photovoltaics,"We report a novel method to determine the amount of pure, aggregated phase of donor and acceptor in organic photovoltaic (OPV) bulk heterojunctions. By determination of the diffraction intensity per unit volume for both donor and acceptor, the volume content of pure, aggregated donor and acceptor in the blend can be determined. We find that for the small molecule X2:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) system, in contrast to most polymer systems, all the PCBM is aggregated, indicating there is negligible miscibility of PCBM with X2. This provides an explanation why the performance of OPV devices of X2:PCBM are high over a large range of PCBM concentrations. This is in contrast to many other OPV blends, where PCBM forms a mixed phase with the donor and does not provide sufficient transport for electrons when the PCBM concentration is low. This study demonstrates that a mixed phase is not necessarily a requirement for good OPV device performance."
227,10.1111/risa.13614,2020,A Health Economic Analysis for Oral Poliovirus Vaccine to Prevent COVID‐19 in the United States,"COVID‐19 led to a recent high‐profile proposal to reintroduce oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the United States (U.S.), initially in clinical trials, but potentially for widespread and repeated use. We explore logistical challenges related to U.S. OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans would exceed $4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable cases of vaccine‐associated paralytic polio, with young Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV‐related viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised individuals with B‐cell related primary immunodeficiencies that could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to responding to COVID‐19. Countries that currently use OPV experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV coverage in OPV‐using countries, and effective global OPV cessation and containment in all countries, including the U.S."

Such a combination works well and synergically improves device short‐circuit current density (Jsc) to 17.99 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) to 77.19%, yielding a milestone efficiency of 11%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest power conversion efficiency reported for SM‐OPVs to date and the first time to combine high Jsc over 17 mA cm−2 and high FF over 77% into one SM‐OPV. The strategy of using multicomponent materials, with a selecting role of balancing varied electronic and structural necessities can be an important route to further developing higher performance devices. This development is important, which broadens the dimension and versatility of existing materials without much chemistry input."
229,10.3390/polym10020123,2018,Recent Advances of Plasmonic Organic Solar Cells: Photophysical Investigations,"The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metallic nanomaterials, such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag), has been extensively exploited to improve the optical absorption, the charge carrier transport, and the ultimate device performances in organic photovoltaic cells (OPV). With the incorporation of diverse metallic nanostructures in active layers, buffer layers, electrodes, or between adjacent layers of OPVs, multiple plasmonic mechanisms may occur and need to be distinguished to better understand plasmonic enhancement. Steady-state photophysics is a powerful tool for unraveling the plasmonic nature and revealing plasmonic mechanisms such as the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), the propagating plasmon-polariton (SPP), and the plasmon-gap mode. Furthermore, the charge transfer dynamics in the organic semiconductor materials can be elucidated from the transient photophysical investigations. In this review article, the basics of the plasmonic mechanisms and the related metallic nanostructures are briefly introduced. We then outline the recent advances of the plasmonic applications in OPVs emphasizing the linkage between the photophysical properties, the nanometallic geometries, and the photovoltaic performance of the OPV devices."
230,10.1021/jacs.8b05834,2018,"Long-Lived, Non-Geminate, Radiative Recombination of Photogenerated Charges in a Polymer/Small-Molecule Acceptor Photovoltaic Blend.","Minimization of open-circuit-voltage ( VOC) loss is required to transcend the efficiency limitations on the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPV). We study charge recombination in an OPV blend comprising a polymer donor with a small molecule nonfullerene acceptor that exhibits both high photovoltaic internal quantum efficiency and relatively high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency. Notably, this donor/acceptor blend, consisting of the donor polymer commonly referred to as PCE10 with a pseudoplanar small molecule acceptor (referred to as FIDTT-2PDI) exhibits relatively bright delayed photoluminescence on the microsecond time scale beyond that observed in the neat material. We study the photoluminescence decay kinetics of the blend in detail and conclude that this long-lived photoluminescence arises from radiative nongeminate recombination of charge carriers, which we propose occurs via a donor/acceptor CT state located close in energy to the singlet state of the polymer donor. Additionally, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies point toward low subgap disorder, which could be beneficial for low radiative and nonradiative losses. These results provide an important demonstration of photoluminescence due to nongeminate charge recombination in an efficient OPV blend, a key step in identifying new OPV materials and materials-screening criteria if OPV is to approach the theoretical limits to efficiency."

Metal sulfides (MeS2) such as MoS2 and WS2 were used as charge transport layers in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in order to enhance the stability in air comparing to poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (


PEDOT
PSS). MeS2 layers with a polycrystalline structure were synthesized by a chemical deposition method using uniformly spin-coated (NH4)MoS4 and (NH4)WS4 precursor solutions. The ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatment on MeS2 leads to the removal of the surface contaminants produced by the transfer process, resulting in a uniform surface and an increase of the work function. The maximum luminance efficiencies of the OLEDs with UV-O3-treated MoS2 and WS2 were 9.44 and 10.82 cd/A, respectively. The power conversion efficiencies of OPV cells based on UV-O3-treated MoS2 and WS2 were 2.96 and 3.08%, respectively. These values correspond to over 95% of those obtained with (


PEDOT
PSS) based devices. Furthermore, OLEDs and OPV cells based on MeS2 showed two to six times longer stability in air compared with


PEDOT
PSS based devices. These results suggest that UV-O3-surface-treated MeS2 could be a promising candidate for a charge transport layer in optoelectronic devices."
233,10.1056/NEJMoa1716677,2018,Type 2 poliovirus detection after global withdrawal of trivalent oral vaccine,"BACKGROUND Mass campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) have brought the world close to the eradication of wild poliovirus. However, to complete eradication, OPV must itself be withdrawn to prevent outbreaks of vaccine‐derived poliovirus (VDPV). Synchronized global withdrawal of OPV began with serotype 2 OPV (OPV2) in April 2016, which presented the first test of the feasibility of eradicating all polioviruses. METHODS We analyzed global surveillance data on the detection of serotype 2 Sabin vaccine (Sabin‐2) poliovirus and serotype 2 vaccine–derived poliovirus (VDPV2, defined as vaccine strains that are at least 0.6% divergent from Sabin‐2 poliovirus in the viral protein 1 genomic region) in stool samples from 495,035 children with acute flaccid paralysis in 118 countries and in 8528 sewage samples from four countries at high risk for transmission; the samples were collected from January 1, 2013, through July 11, 2018. We used Bayesian spatiotemporal smoothing and logistic regression to identify and map risk factors for persistent detection of Sabin‐2 poliovirus and VDPV2. RESULTS The prevalence of Sabin‐2 poliovirus in stool samples declined from 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5 to 4.3) at the time of OPV2 withdrawal to 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1 to 2.7) at 2 months after withdrawal, and the detection rate in sewage samples declined from 71.0% (95% CI, 61.0 to 80.0) to 13.0% (95% CI, 8.0 to 20.0) during the same period. However, 12 months after OPV2 withdrawal, Sabin‐2 poliovirus continued to be detected in stool samples (<0.1%; 95% CI, <0.1 to 0.1) and sewage samples (8.0%; 95% CI, 5.0 to 13.0) because of the use of OPV2 in response to VDPV2 outbreaks. Nine outbreaks were reported after OPV2 withdrawal and were associated with low coverage of routine immunization (odds ratio, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.14 to 2.54] per 10% absolute decrease) and low levels of population immunity (odds ratio, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.35 to 5.59] per 10% absolute decrease) within affected countries. CONCLUSIONS High population immunity has facilitated the decline in the prevalence of Sabin‐2 poliovirus after OPV2 withdrawal and restricted the circulation of VDPV2 to areas known to be at high risk for transmission. The prevention of VDPV2 outbreaks in these known areas before the accumulation of substantial cohorts of children susceptible to type 2 poliovirus remains a high priority.

234,10.1002/aelm.201600288,2016,Luminescent Downshifting by Photo‐Induced Sol‐Gel Hybrid Coatings: Accessing Multifunctionality on Flexible Organic Photovoltaics via Ambient Temperature Material Processing,"A novel high‐durability multifunctional organic–inorganic hybrid coating material is presented in this work as luminescent down‐shifting (LDS) host matrix system for flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Such new LDS coating is obtained by incorporating a convenient fluorescent organic dye in an appropriately functionalized fluoropolymeric resin that can be readily crosslinked by means of a dual‐cure mechanism with a single‐step ambient‐temperature photo‐induced sol–gel process. Due to its peculiar characteristics, the newly proposed system may be readily implemented in heat‐sensitive flexible devices. By carefully tuning the amount of organic fluorophore in the hybrid coating material, a maximum increase in power conversion efficiency exceeding 4% is achieved on devices incorporating the new LDS layer with respect to control systems. This represents the highest efficiency enhancement reported to date on flexible OPVs by means of a polymer‐based LDS layer. In addition, long‐term accelerated weathering tests (>550 h) highlight the excellent stability of LDS‐coated OPV devices, which can retain 80% of their initial performance, as opposed to the dramatic efficiency decay experienced by control uncoated devices. The approach presented here opens the way to the straightforward incorporation of versatile multifunctional light‐managing layers on flexible OPV systems for improved device efficiency and lifetime."
235,10.1002/aenm.201300100,2013,ITO‐Free and Fully Solution‐Processed Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells with High Fill Factors,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells that can be simply processed from solution are in the focus of the academic and industrial community because of their enormous potential to reduce cost. One big challenge in developing a fully solution‐processed OPV technology is the design of a well‐performing electrode system, allowing the replacement of ITO. Several solution‐processed electrode systems were already discussed, but none of them could match the performance of ITO. Here, we report efficient ITO‐free and fully solution‐processed semitransparent inverted organic solar cells based on silver nanowire (AgNW) electrodes. To demonstrate the potential of these AgNW electrodes, they were employed as both the bottom and top electrodes. Record devices achieved fill factors as high as 63.0%, which is comparable to ITO based reference devices. These results provide important progress for fully printed organic solar cells and indicate that ITO‐free, transparent as well as non‐transparent organic solar cells can indeed be fully solution‐processed without losses."
236,10.1093/NSR/NWW020,2016,Development of polymer-fullerene solar cells,"Global efforts and synergetic interdisciplinary collaborations on solution-processed bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs or OPVs) made power conversion efficiencies over 10% possible. The rapid progress of the field is credited to the synthesis of a large number of novel polymers with specially tunable optoelectronic properties, a better control over the nano-morphology of photoactive blend layers, the introduction of various effective interfacial layers, new device architectures and a deeper understanding of device physics. We will review the pioneering materials for polymer-fullerene solar cells and trace the progress of concepts driving their development. We discuss the evolution of morphology control, interfacial layers and device structures fully exploring the potential of photoactive materials. In order to guide a further increase in power conversion efficiency of OPV, the current understanding of the process of free charge carrier generation and the origin of the photovoltage is summarized followed by a perspective on how to overcome the limitations for industrializing PSCs."
237,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002599,2012,Systematic Review of Mucosal Immunity Induced by Oral and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccines against Virus Shedding following Oral Poliovirus Challenge,"Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) may be used in mass vaccination campaigns during the final stages of polio eradication. It is also likely to be adopted by many countries following the coordinated global cessation of vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) after eradication. The success of IPV in the control of poliomyelitis outbreaks will depend on the degree of nasopharyngeal and intestinal mucosal immunity induced against poliovirus infection. We performed a systematic review of studies published through May 2011 that recorded the prevalence of poliovirus shedding in stool samples or nasopharyngeal secretions collected 5-30 days after a ""challenge"" dose of OPV. Studies were combined in a meta-analysis of the odds of shedding among children vaccinated according to IPV, OPV, and combination schedules. We identified 31 studies of shedding in stool and four in nasopharyngeal samples that met the inclusion criteria. Individuals vaccinated with OPV were protected against infection and shedding of poliovirus in stool samples collected after challenge compared with unvaccinated individuals (summary odds ratio [OR] for shedding 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.24)). In contrast, IPV provided no protection against shedding compared with unvaccinated individuals (summary OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.59-1.11]) or when given in addition to OPV, compared with individuals given OPV alone (summary OR 1.14 [95% CI 0.82-1.58]). There were insufficient studies of nasopharyngeal shedding to draw a conclusion. IPV does not induce sufficient intestinal mucosal immunity to reduce the prevalence of fecal poliovirus shedding after challenge, although there was some evidence that it can reduce the quantity of virus shed. The impact of IPV on poliovirus transmission in countries where fecal-oral spread is common is unknown but is likely to be limited compared with OPV."

a significant proportion of the maize (Zea mays 
L.) seed system in many countries of sub- 
Saharan Africa. The International Maize and 
Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) has 
been breeding improved maize varieties for the 
stress-prone environments experienced by most 
smallholder farmers in eastern and southern 
Africa for over 30 yr. Hybrid breeding is now the 
major focus of the CIMMYT breeding pipeline. 
However, OPVs are generated within the hybrid 
pipeline. This is the first study to document 
genetic gain for maize grain yield under both 
optimal and stress (random and managed 
drought, low nitrogen [N], and maize streak virus 
[MSV]) conditions within the CIMMYT eastern 
and southern African OPV breeding pipeline. 
Genetic gain was estimated using the slope of 
the regression on the year of OPV release in 
regional trials over a 12-yr period (1999–2011). 
Open-pollinated varieties were separated into 
two maturity groups, early (<70 d to anthesis) 
and intermediate-late (>70 d to anthesis). 
Genetic gain in the early maturity group under 
optimal conditions, random drought, low N, and 
MSV was 109.9, 29.2, 84.8, and 192.9 kg ha−1 
yr−1. In the intermediate-late maturity group, 
genetic gain under optimal conditions, random 
drought, low N, and MSV was 79.1, 42.3, 53.0 
and 108.7 kg ha−1 yr−1. No significant yield gains 
were made under managed drought stress 
for both maturity groups. Our results show 
continued improvement in OPVs for both yield 
potential and stress tolerance."

However, current chalcogen‐based conformational lock strategies for organic semiconductors are limited to S···X (X = O, N, halide) weak interactions. An easily accessible (minimal synthetic steps) and structurally planar selenophene‐based building block, 1,2‐diethoxy‐1,2‐bisselenylvinylene (DESVS), with novel Se···O noncovalent conformational locks is designed and synthesized. DESVS unique properties are supported by density functional theory computed electronic structures, single crystal structures, and experimental lattice cohesion metrics. Based on this building block, a new class of stable, structurally planar, and solution‐processable conjugated polymers are synthesized and implemented in organic thin‐film transistors (TFT) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. DESVS‐based polymers exhibit carrier mobilities in air as high as 1.49 cm2 V−1 s−1 (p‐type) and 0.65 cm2 V−1 s−1 (n‐type) in TFTs, and power conversion efficiency >5% in OPV cells."
240,10.1002/aenm.201602143,2017,Photogenerated Carrier Mobility Significantly Exceeds Injected Carrier Mobility in Organic Solar Cells,"Charge transport in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is often characterized by space‐charge limited currents (SCLC). However, this technique only probes the transport of charges residing at quasi‐equilibrium energies in the disorder‐broadened density of states (DOS). In contrast, in an operating OPV device the photogenerated carriers are typically created at higher energies in the DOS, followed by slow thermalization. Here, by ultrafast time‐resolved experiments and simulations it is shown that in disordered polymer/fullerene and polymer/polymer OPVs, the mobility of photogenerated carriers significantly exceeds that of injected carriers probed by SCLC. Time‐resolved charge transport in a polymer/polymer OPV device is measured with exceptionally high (picosecond) time resolution. The essential physics that SCLC fails to capture is that of photogenerated carrier thermalization, which boosts carrier mobility. It is predicted that only for materials with a sufficiently low energetic disorder, thermalization effects on carrier transport can be neglected. For a typical device thickness of 100 nm, the limiting energetic disorder is σ ≈71 (56) meV for maximum‐power point (short‐circuit) conditions, depending on the error one is willing to accept. As in typical OPV materials the disorder is usually larger, the results question the validity of the SCLC method to describe operating OPVs."

They have emerged as a promising candidate for affordable, clean, and renewable energy. In the past few years, a rapid increase has been seen in the power conversion efficiency of OPV devices toward 10% and above, through comprehensive optimizations via novel photoactive donor and acceptor materials, control of thin-film morphology on the nanoscale, device structure developments, and interfacial and optical engineering. The intrinsic problems of short exciton diffusion length and low carrier mobility in organic semiconductors creates a challenge for OPV designs for achieving optically thick and electrically thin device structures to achieve sufficient light absorption and efficient electron/hole extraction. Recent advances in the field of OPV devices are reviewed, with a focus on the progress in device architecture and optical engineering approaches that lead to improved electrical and optical characteristics in OPV devices. Successful strategies are highlighted for light wave distribution, modulation, and absorption promotion inside the active layer of OPV devices by incorporating periodic nanopatterns/nanostructures or incorporating metallic nanomaterials and nanostructures."

These high performances, together with the suitability of the technology to inexpensive large-scale manufacture, over lightweight and flexible plastic substrates using roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, place the technology amongst the most promising for future harvesting of solar energy. Although OPVs using non-fullerene acceptors have recently outperformed their fullerene-based counterparts, the research in the development of new fullerenes and in the improvement of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology and device efficiency of polymer:fullerene solar cells remains very active. In this review article, the most relevant research works performed over the last 3 years, that is, since the year 2016 onwards, in the field of fullerene-based polymer solar cells based on the copolymers PTB7, PTB7-Th (also known as PBDTTT-EFT) and PffBT4T-2OD, are presented and discussed. This review is primarily focused on studies that involve the improvement of the BHJ morphology, efficiency and stability of small active area devices (typically < 15 mm2), through the use of different processing strategies such as the use of different fullerene acceptors, different processing solvents and additives and different thermal treatments."
243,10.1021/ja2080482,2012,"Competition between singlet fission and charge separation in solution-processed blend films of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene with sterically-encumbered perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide)s.","The photophysics and morphology of thin films of N,N-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (1) and the 1,7-diphenyl (2) and 1,7-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl) (3) derivatives blended with 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-Pn) were studied for their potential use as photoactive layers in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Increasing the steric bulk of the 1,7-substituents of the perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (PDI) impedes aggregation in the solid state. Film characterization data using both atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction showed that decreasing the PDI aggregation by increasing the steric bulk in the order 1 < 2 < 3 correlates with a decrease in the density/size of crystalline TIPS-Pn domains. Transient absorption spectroscopy was performed on ~100 nm solution-processed TIPS-Pn:PDI blend films to characterize the charge separation dynamics. These results showed that selective excitation of the TIPS-Pn results in competition between ultrafast singlet fission ((1*)TIPS-Pn + TIPS-Pn → 2 (3*)TIPS-Pn) and charge transfer from (1*)TIPS-Pn to PDIs 1-3. As the blend films become more homogeneous across the series TIPS-Pn:PDI 1 → 2 → 3, charge separation becomes competitive with singlet fission. Ultrafast charge separation forms the geminate radical ion pair state (1)(TIPS-Pn(+•)-PDI(-•)) that undergoes radical pair intersystem crossing to form (3)(TIPS-Pn(+•)-PDI(-•)), which then undergoes charge recombination to yield either (3*)PDI or (3*)TIPS-Pn. Energy transfer from (3*)PDI to TIPS-Pn also yields (3*)TIPS-Pn. These results show that multiple pathways produce the (3*)TIPS-Pn state, so that OPV design strategies based on this system must utilize this triplet state for charge separation."

245,10.1093/jac/dku545,2015,"ST-246 is a key antiviral to inhibit the viral F13L phospholipase, one of the essential proteins for orthopoxvirus wrapping","Abstract Objectives ST-246 is one of the key antivirals being developed to fight orthopoxvirus (OPV) infections. Its exact mode of action is not completely understood, but it has been reported to interfere with the wrapping of infectious virions, for which F13L (peripheral membrane protein) and B5R (type I glycoprotein) are required. Here we monitored the appearance of ST-246 resistance to identify its molecular target. Methods Vaccinia virus (VACV), cowpox virus (CPXV) and camelpox virus (CMLV) with reduced susceptibility to ST-246 were selected in cell culture and further characterized by antiviral assays and immunofluorescence. A panel of recombinant OPVs was engineered and a putative 3D model of F13L coupled with molecular docking was used to visualize drug–target interaction. The F13L gene of 65 CPXVs was sequenced to investigate F13L amino acid heterogeneity. Results Amino acid substitutions or insertions were found in the F13L gene of six drug-resistant OPVs and production of four F13L-recombinant viruses confirmed their role(s) in the occurrence of ST-246 resistance. F13L, but not B5R, knockout OPVs showed resistance to ST-246. ST-246 treatment of WT OPVs delocalized F13L- and B5R-encoded proteins and blocked virus wrapping. Putative modelling of F13L and ST-246 revealed a probable pocket into which ST-246 penetrates. None of the identified amino acid changes occurred naturally among newly sequenced or NCBI-derived OPV F13L sequences. Conclusions Besides demonstrating that F13L is a direct target of ST-246, we also identified novel F13L residues involved in the interaction with ST-246. These findings are important for ST-246 use in the clinic and crucial for future drug-resistance surveillance programmes."

In this work, a series of anticancer drug conjugates were prepared by linking thiol-modified oligo( p-phenylene vinylene) with paclitaxel, vincristine, teniposide, tamoxifen, doxorubicin, or podophyllotoxin (OPV-S-Drugs) through a Michael addition reaction. These OPV-S-Drugs could undergo intracellular assembly and aggregation upon oxidation to yield multivalent anticancer drug clusters, which inhibited their diffusion from cancer cells. The intracellular aggregation of OPV-S-Drugs originates from π–π stacking and hydrophobic interactions between OPV backbones, followed by cross-linking via disulfide bond formation in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The drug clusters occur only in the cytoplasm of cancer cells expressing high ROS levels, but not in healthy mammalian cells, thus reducing the cytotoxicity to normal cells. Specifically, the super-toxicity of podophyllotoxin to normal cells was obviously suppressed while the drug efficacy was maintained through our new strategy. The diverse action mechanisms of OPV-S-Drugs toward cancer cells is proposed."
247,10.1039/C3EE41821A,2013,On the role of intermixed phases in organic photovoltaic blends,"Recently, an intermixed phase has been identified within organic photovoltaic (OPV) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems that can exist in addition to relatively phase-pure regions, highlighting the need for a refined picture of the solid-state microstructure of donor–acceptor blends and for gaining further understanding of the exact nature and role such intermixed phases play in such devices. Here we manipulate the microstructure of polymer–fullerene systems via processing means and the selection of the molecular weight of the donor polymer. This manipulation is used as a tool to vary the fraction of intermixed phase present and its effects on the structure and subsequently the opto-electronic processes. We find clear relationships between the state of mixing and amount of exciton quenching and number of polarons generated per absorbed photon. Furthermore, we observe that blend systems incorporating higher molecular weight polymer result in a greater yield of dissociated polarons, likely due to the increase of the intermixed fraction."
248,10.1002/adfm.201900154,2019,All‐Day Operating Quaternary Blend Organic Photovoltaics,"The unique properties of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) offer great promise in emerging applications such as wearable electronics or the Internet of Things. For their successful utilization, OPV operation should be designed for versatile irradiation circumstances in addition to solar light since they should be capable of providing electric power when there is no sunlight or when they operate indoors. Here, a quaternary OPV (Q‐OPV) as a semitransparent, colorful energy platform that operates efficiently under both solar and artificial light irradiation is demonstrated. The experimentally optimized Q‐OPV shows a broadened spectral response and improved charge transport process with suppressed recombination, thereby providing high output powers that are sufficient to autonomously operate low‐power electronic devices. In addition, the Q‐OPV benefits from improved morphological stability with a reduced driving force for grain growth by the increased entropy in the quaternary blend system. The important features of the Q‐OPV platform such as semitransparency, high tolerance to film thickness, and color codability, while pursuing the improved performance and thermal durability, further open new opportunities as an all‐day (24/7/365) power generator in broad practical applications."
249,10.1021/ja410092n,2014,Quantitative bimolecular recombination in organic photovoltaics through triplet exciton formation.,"The nanoscale morphology and high charge densities in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) lead to a high rate of bimolecular encounters between spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes. This process can lead to the formation of low-energy triplet excitons on the donor polymer that decay nonradiatively and limit the device performance. We use time-resolved optical spectroscopy to characterize the effect of morphology through the use of solvent additives such as 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) on triplet dynamics and charge recombination in blends of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b']-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester. This is an attractive OPV system since the extended absorption of the polymer into the near-infrared gives good coverage of the solar spectrum, but nevertheless, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) has not been reported to be higher than ~65% under short circuit conditions. We find that, without ODT, the IQE is 48% and 16% of excitations decay via bimolecular triplet formation. With ODT treatment, which improves crystallinity and carrier mobility, the IQE increases to 65%, but bimolecular triplet formation significantly increases and now accounts for all of the recombination (35% of charges)."

By thermal annealing, a N-Zn chemical bond formed between PBI-H and ZnO, inducing close organic-inorganic combination. In addition, this co-interlayer shows decreased work function and increased electron transportation and conductivity, which are benefits for the cathode to enhance charge extraction efficiency and decrease recombination losses. As a result a highly efficient i-OPV was achieved with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.43% based on this co-interlayer with PTB7:PC71BM as the active layer, which shows over 35% enhancement compared to that of the device without the PBI-H layer. Moreover, this co-interlayer was widely applicable for i-OPVs based on various material systems, such as P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM, resulting in PCE as high as 4.78% and 10.31%, respectively."

With recently reported power conversion efficiencies of 11–12%, OPVs are on the brink of economic viability. However, to push these technologies forward into widespread use, further optimizations of efficiency are needed. The process of exciton dissociation and charge separation at donor/acceptor interfaces is a major factor influencing the power conversion efficiency of these devices, with loss of useful energy occurring if the charges fail to separate. However, this process of exciton dissociation and separation at OPV heterojunctions is not fully understood, and experimental efforts to optimize these processes via trial and error are costly. Thus, theoretical modeling plays a key role in understanding and improving the rate of charge generation in OPVs. Here we review key theoretical approaches to modeling the process of exciton dissociation and charge separation and their contributions to the challenge of optimizing OPV technology."

Among all SMAs, the ITIC‐derivative is the most promising OPV cell using ITIC‐derivative acceptors with a power conversion efficiency > 15%. However, the operation stability of SMA‐based devices under illumination is relatively inferior when compared to bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) cells that employ polymeric acceptors. Here, a polymer acceptor N2200 is used as the ternary component to study the device performance of ITIC‐derivative‐based PBDB‐T:ITIC‐M and PBDB‐T‐2F:IT‐4F BHJ solar cells, which currently are the representative state‐of‐the‐art high‐performance OPV devices. The ternary solar cells with low N2200 loading enjoy significantly improved operation stability, while maintaining a high power conversion efficiency. A comprehensive mechanism study is conducted on the ternary OPV systems in i) electronic and ii) thermal aspects. For i), the ternary BHJs show remarkably improved electron transport. For ii), the thermal diffusivity D of the ternary BHJ exhibits almost an order of magnitude improvement in D values, indicating that heat can be more effectively transferred out of such films than binary counterpart. The results show that N2200 ternary loading facilitates an improved network for both electron transport and heat dissipation, leading to improved photostability."

This progress places organic solar cells at the forefront of thin-film photovoltaic technology. However, in order to meet industrial demands and reach high performance values in industrial settings, further research and development efforts within roll-to-roll (R2R) and sheet-to-sheet (S2S) processing of OPV devices under ambient conditions are required. Furthermore, OPV modules being manufactured through such up-scaled processing techniques should ideally be developed from low cost materials, and show good stability towards various different operational stress conditions. In this work, we demonstrate combined R2R and S2S development of ITO-free OPV devices, which are based on the non-fullerene material system PBDB-T:ITIC. The devices are processed from R2R vacuum sputtering and S2S slot-die coating at ambient conditions, and reach cell PCE values of 5.5%. In addition, we introduce a correlation between different barrier films, both commercial and sputtered inorganic coatings on ultra-clean PET, and the lifetime of the developed devices. The results therefore demonstrate an important step in the development of OPV devices from R2R and S2S processes in industrial settings."

Reference Data at the CCSD(T) Complete Basis Set Limit.,"In designing organic materials for electronics applications, particularly for organic photovoltaics (OPV), the ionization potential (IP) of the donor and the electron affinity (EA) of the acceptor play key roles. This makes OPV design an appealing application for computational chemistry since IPs and EAs are readily calculable from most electronic structure methods. Unfortunately reliable, high-accuracy wave function methods, such as coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] in the complete basis set (CBS) limit are too expensive for routine applications to this problem for any but the smallest of systems. One solution is to calibrate approximate, less computationally expensive methods against a database of high-accuracy IP/EA values; however, to our knowledge, no such database exists for systems related to OPV design. The present work is the first of a multipart study whose overarching goal is to determine which computational methods can be used to reliably compute IPs and EAs of electron acceptors. This part introduces a database of 24 known organic electron acceptors and provides high-accuracy vertical IP and EA values expected to be within ±0.03 eV of the true non-relativistic, vertical CCSD(T)/CBS limit. Convergence of IP and EA values toward the CBS limit is studied systematically for the Hartree-Fock, MP2 correlation, and beyond-MP2 coupled cluster contributions to the focal point estimates."

An oligo(p‐phenylenevinylene) unit with thiol groups and a PTX unit (OPV‐S‐PTX), which enhances drug efficacy and reverses resistance is thus designed. The mechanism involves diffusion of OPV‐S‐PTX into the cell, where π–π interactions lead to aggregation. Cross‐linking of the aggregates via oxidation of thiol groups is favored in tumor cells because of the higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration. Cross‐linked aggregates “chemically lock” the multichromophore particle for a more persistent effect. The IC50 of OPV‐S‐PTX for tumor cell line A549 is reduced down to 0.33 × 10−9m from that observed for PTX itself (41 × 10−9m). Enhanced efficacy by OPV‐S‐PTX is proposed to proceed via acceleration of microtubule bundle formation. A549/T‐inoculated xenograft mice experiments reveal suppression of tumor growth upon OPV‐S‐PTX treatment. Altogether, these results show that the internal cross‐linking of OPV‐S‐PTX through ROS provides a means to discriminate between tumor and healthy cells and the formation of the chemically locked particles enhances drug efficacy and helps in reducing resistance."
258,10.3390/v9060142,2017,Classification of Cowpox Viruses into Several Distinct Clades and Identification of a Novel Lineage,"Cowpox virus (CPXV) was considered as uniform species within the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPV). Previous phylogenetic analysis indicated that CPXV is polyphyletic and isolates may cluster into different clades with two of these clades showing genetic similarities to either variola (VARV) or vaccinia viruses (VACV). Further analyses were initiated to assess both the genetic diversity and the evolutionary background of circulating CPXVs. Here we report the full-length sequences of 20 CPXV strains isolated from different animal species and humans in Germany. A phylogenetic analysis of altogether 83 full-length OPV genomes confirmed the polyphyletic character of the species CPXV and suggested at least four different clades. The German isolates from this study mainly clustered into two CPXV-like clades, and VARV- and VACV-like strains were not observed. A single strain, isolated from a cotton-top tamarin, clustered distantly from all other CPXVs and might represent a novel and unique evolutionary lineage. The classification of CPXV strains into clades roughly followed their geographic origin, with the highest clade diversity so far observed for Germany. Furthermore, we found evidence for recombination between OPV clades without significant disruption of the observed clustering. In conclusion, this analysis markedly expands the number of available CPXV full-length sequences and confirms the co-circulation of several CPXV clades in Germany, and provides the first data about a new evolutionary CPXV lineage."
259,10.1002/aenm.201703551,2018,Key Tradeoffs Limiting the Performance of Organic Photovoltaics,"2017 saw the publication of several new material systems that challenge the long‐held notion that a driving force is necessary for efficient exciton dissociation in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and that a loss of ≈0.6 eV between the energy of the charge transfer state Ect and the energy corresponding to open circuit is general. In light of these developments, the authors combine insights from device physics and spectroscopy to review the two key tradeoffs limiting OPV performances. These are the tradeoff between the charge carrier generation efficiency and the achievable open circuit voltage (Voc) and the tradeoff between device thickness (light absorption) and fill factor. The emergence of several competitive nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) is exciting for both of these. The authors analyze what makes these materials compare favorably to fullerenes, including the potential role of molecular vibrations, and discuss both design criteria for new molecules and the achievable power conversion efficiencies."
260,10.1093/infdis/jit845,2014,Modeling the dynamics of oral poliovirus vaccine cessation.,"BACKGROUND
Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) results in an ongoing burden of poliomyelitis due to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). This motivates globally coordinated OPV cessation after wild poliovirus eradication.


METHODS
We modeled poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution to characterize the interaction between population immunity, OPV-related virus prevalence, and the emergence of cVDPVs after OPV cessation. We explored strategies to prevent and manage cVDPVs for countries that currently use OPV for immunization and characterized cVDPV emergence risks and OPV use for outbreak response.


RESULTS
Continued intense supplemental immunization activities until OPV cessation represent the best strategy to prevent cVDPV emergence after OPV cessation in areas with insufficient routine immunization coverage. Policy makers must actively manage population immunity before OPV cessation to prevent cVDPVs and aggressively respond if prevention fails. Sufficiently aggressive response with OPV to interrupt transmission of the cVDPV outbreak virus will lead to die-out of OPV-related viruses used for response in the outbreak population. Further analyses should consider the risk of exportation to other populations of the outbreak virus and any OPV used for outbreak response.


CONCLUSIONS
OPV cessation can successfully eliminate all circulating live polioviruses in a population. The polio end game requires active risk management."

By precisely controlling the thickness of the ITO layer, OPV devices exhibiting high transparency and a wide and high‐purity color gamut are obtained: blue (B), green (G), yellow‐green (YG), yellow (Y), orange (O), and red (R). The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the G, YG, and Y color devices are greater than 8% (AM 1.5G irradiation, 100 mW cm−2) with maximum transmittances (TMAX) of greater than 14.5%. An optimized PCE of 8.2% was obtained for the YG OPV [CIE 1931 coordinates: (0.364, 0.542)], with a value of TMAX of 17.3% (at 561 nm). As far as it is known, this performance is the highest ever reported for a transparent colorful OPV. Such high transparency and desired transmitted colors, which can perspective see the clear images, suggest great potential for use in building‐integrated photovoltaic applications."

Our focus will be on discussing the development of new donor polymers and device technologies, which resulted in enormous progress in OPV performances with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8–9%. However, for the wide spread usage of OPVs, high module efficiencies (>10%) and lifetimes suitable for commercial applications are required. To achieve such goals, interdisciplinary advances in the development of new light-harvesting materials, the improvement of device structures, and the development of cost effective device processing methods are crucial. In particular, new donor polymers overcoming the drawbacks of current polymer solar cells can play an important role to further improve the PCEs and device stability. This perspective article addresses the polymer design criteria that have been distilled out from the research of the past 20 years: energy level matching, nano-morphology of polymer/acceptor blend films, local dipole moments of the polymer chains, and stability. Also, we introduce representative donor polymers and describe the research progress in the polymers development to move beyond certain milestones. We emphasize the importance of the synergetic research efforts in developing new materials, such as the design of new polymers with improved physical properties, the development of device technologies and a fundamental understanding of OPV mechanisms, which will help to continuously enhance the performance of OPVs."

The effect of BDT and NDI substituents (alkyl vs alkoxy or linear vs branched) on the polymer performance in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and all‐polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is reported. Co‐monomer selection and backbone functionalization substantially modifies the polymer MO energies, thin film morphology, and charge transport properties, as indicated by electrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, AFM, DFT calculations, and TFT response.

It is based on the use of a laser beam for the in situ, non‐thermal, reduction of spin‐coated GO films on flexible substrates over a large area. The photoreduction process is one‐step, facile, and is rapidly carried out at room temperature in air without affecting the integrity of the graphene lattice or the flexibility of the underlying substrate. Conductive graphene films with a sheet resistance of as low as 700 Ω sq−1 and transmittance of 44% can be obtained, much higher than can be achieved for flexible layers reduced by chemical means. As a proof of concept of our technique, laser‐reduced GO (LrGO) films are utilized as transparent electrodes in flexible, bulk heterojunction, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, replacing the traditional ITO. The devices displayed a power‐conversion efficiency of 1.1%, which is the highest reported so far for OPV device incorporating reduced GO as the transparent electrode. The in situ non‐thermal photoreduction of spin‐coated GO films creates a new way to produce flexible functional graphene electrodes for a variety of electronic applications in a process that carries substantial promise for industrial implementation."
267,10.1021/JZ2012403,2011,Entropy of Charge Separation in Organic Photovoltaic Cells: The Benefit of Higher Dimensionality,"The role of entropy in charge separation processes is discussed with respect to the dimensionality of the organic semiconductor. In 1-D materials, the change in entropy, ΔS, plays no role, but at higher dimensions, it leads to a substantial decrease in the Coulomb barrier for charge separation. The effects of ΔS are highest in equilibrium systems but decrease and become time-dependent in illuminated organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Higher-dimensional semiconductors have inherent advantages for charge separation, and this may be one reason that C60 and its derivatives, the only truly three-dimensional organic semiconductors yet known, play such an important role in OPV cells."

The OTMS-functionalized Au/SiO2 core/shell nanorods and nanospheres were then incorporated into the active layers of two OPV polymer systems: a poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCB60M) OPV device and a poly[2,6-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5-dibutyloctyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PBDTT-DPP:PC60BM) OPV device. For the P3HT:PC60BM polymer with a band edge of ~700 nm, the addition of the core/shell nanorods with an aspect ratio (AR) of ~2.5 (extinction peak ~670 nm) resulted in a 7.1% improvement in PCE, while for the PBDTT-DPP:PC60BM polymer with a band edge of ~860 nm, the addition of core/shell nanorods with an AR of ~4 (extinction peak ~830 nm) resulted in a 14.4% improvement in PCE. The addition of Au/SiO2 core/shell nanospheres to the P3HT:PC60BM polymer resulted in a 2.7% improvement in PCE, while their addition to a PBDTT-DPP:PC60BM polymer resulted in a 9.1% improvement. The PCE and Jsc enhancements were consistent with external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, and the EQE enhancements spectrally matched the extinction spectra of Au/SiO2 nanospheres and nanorods in both OPV polymer systems."

The withdrawal would begin in a phased manner with removal of the type 2 component of OPV in 2016 through a global switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (containing only types 1 and 3). To mitigate risks associated with immunity gaps after OPV type 2 withdrawal, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts has recommended that all 126 OPV-only using countries introduce at least one dose of inactivated polio vaccine into routine immunization programs by end-2015, before the trivalent OPV-bivalent OPV switch. The introduction of inactivated polio vaccine would reduce risks of reintroduction of type 2 poliovirus by providing some level of seroprotection, facilitating interruption of transmission if outbreaks occur, and accelerating eradication by boosting immunity to types 1 and 3 polioviruses."

273,10.1002/adma.201102173,2011,Bulk Heterojunction Photovoltaic Cells with Low Donor Concentration,"High-effi ciency organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are mostly based on a bulk heterojunction [ 1 ] (BHJ) structure, which is essentially a thin fi lm of mixed electron donor and acceptor. With few exceptions, the acceptor component is a fullerene-based material such as C 60 [ 2 ] and PCBM, [ 3 ] whereas a large variety of materials has been found to be useful as the donor component. [ 4 ] In order to achieve high power conversion effi ciency, the donor–acceptor composition of the BHJ needs to be optimized with respect to light absorption and charge generation, including for instance the use of a low bandgap donor, [ 5 ] to complement the absorption of the acceptor and selecting a donor with proper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels to match that of the acceptor. In this work, we show that it is possible to achieve a large open-circuit voltage ( V oc > 1.0 V) in a fullerene-based OPV with almost any donor, provided that the donor is present in a small concentration and that MoO x is used as the Schottky barrier contact [ 6 ] to the BHJ. With fi ne tuning of the donor concentration to overcome the hole-transport limitation in the BHJ, high power conversion effi ciency ( η PCE > 5%) has been realized. In Figure 1 the schematic of the OPV cell layer sequence, indium tin oxide (ITO)/MoO x /BHJ/bathophenanthroline (Bphen)/Al, is shown along with the molecular structures of 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane (TAPC), Bphen, C 60 , and C 70 . In this sequence, the BHJ layer is a mixed fi lm of TAPC [ 7 ] (donor) and C 60 (acceptor) with various ratios. The concentration of TAPC is indicated in volume fraction. As the major focus of this study was concerned with the composition of the BHJ layer, we kept the thickness and composition of all the other layers constant: ITO (90 nm), MoO x  (2 nm), Bphen (8 nm), and Al (100 nm). First, we studied the effect of varying the TAPC concentration in the BHJ layer with a constant thickness of 40 nm. In Figure 2 a the current density–voltage ( J – V ) characteristics are"
274,10.1021/ja203235z,2011,Steric control of the donor/acceptor interface: implications in organic photovoltaic charge generation.,"The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is currently limited by modest short-circuit current densities. Approaches toward improving this output parameter may provide new avenues to advance OPV technologies and the basic science of charge transfer in organic semiconductors. This work highlights how steric control of the charge separation interface can be effectively tuned in OPV devices. By introducing an octylphenyl substituent onto the investigated polymer backbones, the thermally relaxed charge-transfer state, and potentially excited charge-transfer states, can be raised in energy. This decreases the barrier to charge separation and results in increased photocurrent generation. This finding is of particular significance for nonfullerene OPVs, which have many potential advantages such as tunable energy levels and spectral breadth, but are prone to poor exciton separation efficiencies. Computational, spectroscopic, and synthetic methods were combined to develop a structure-property relationship that correlates polymer substituents with charge-transfer state energies and, ultimately, device efficiencies."

P1 consists of a porphyrin ring linked by two ethylrhodanine end caps via phenylene ethynylene bridges. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells using P1 as the donor exhibit significantly improved performances under indoor illumination compared to 1 sun conditions. For P1:PC71BM cells, an optimized-PCE of 19.2% was achieved under a 300 lux illumination of a 3000 K LED tube. Besides high PCEs, the porphyrin-based devices also exhibit enhanced OPV performances in thick film regions (∼200 nm) compared to a control BHJ cell using PCDTBT:PC71BM. The thick-film P1-based device shows an overall PCE of 18.2%. The origins of the thickness independent OPV performances were examined, and they can be attributed to the low electronic disorders of these materials when compared to their polymer counterparts."
276,10.1039/C3RA22926B,2013,Rational design on n-type organic materials for high performance organic photovoltaics,"The demand for further optimization of the photovoltaic efficiency has stimulated an intensive research effort both for new low-band-gap polymeric materials as electron donors and for new efficient electron-accepting materials. As regards the latter, less attention has been observed on the optimization of the electron acceptor material compared to the extensive studies on the electron donor polymer in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The majority of the acceptor materials used so far in solar cells are organic (carbon based) materials, however other traditional acceptor materials include inorganic semiconductors, such as cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals, titanium oxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. From the implemented organic materials high power conversion efficiencies PCEs (>9.0%) are observed in OPVs utilizing fullerene derivatives and especially [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) as the acceptor. Recently, very promising efficiencies of ∼5.0% have been also obtained by Polyera corporation utilizing soluble conjugated polymers as both the donor and the acceptor components. It is therefore expected that through improved materials design for enhancing the electron mobility, better tuning of the energy levels and absorption profile of organic materials, significant improvements in the device performance can still be expected. In this work, the current trends on the most promising solution processable n-type organic materials (fullerene derivatives, small molecules and conjugated polymers) will be presented in detail, emphasizing on the correlation between structure/optoelectronic properties/morphology characterization and device performances."
277,10.1039/c5cp00507h,2015,Use of silane-functionalized graphene oxide in organic photovoltaic cells and organic light-emitting diodes.,"Graphene oxide (GO) and silane-functionalized GO (sGO) sheets obtained through a simple sonication exfoliation method are employed as hole transport layers to improve the efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells and organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). GO was functionalized using (3-glycidyl oxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and triethoxymethylsilane (MTES). The appearance of new peaks in the Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the sGOs indicates the formation of Si-O-C, Si-O-Si, Si-H, and Si-O-C moieties, which provide evidence of the addition of silane to the GO surface. Furthermore, the appearance of Si-O-Si bonds in the synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectra (SRPES) of the MTES-sGO and GPTMS-sGO samples suggests that silane groups were effectively functionalized onto the GO sheets. An OPV cell with GO layers showed a lower performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.06%; in contrast, OPV cells based on GPTMS-sGO and MTES-sGO have PCE values of 3.00 and 3.08%, respectively. The OLED devices based on GPTMS-sGO and MTES-sGO showed a higher maximum luminance efficiency of 13.91 and 12.77 cd A(-1), respectively, than PEDOT:PSS-based devices (12.34 cd A(-1)). The SRPES results revealed that the work functions of GO, GPTMS-sGO, and MTES-sGO were 4.8, 4.9, and 5.0 eV, respectively. Therefore, the increase in the PCE value is attributed to improved band-gap alignment. It is thought that sGO could be used as an interfacial layer in OPV and OLED devices."

In this review article, the focus is on recent efforts to control nanomorphologies of photoactive layer and discussion of various solution-processed charge transport and extraction materials, to maximize the performance of OPV cells. Next, recent works on printing and coating technologies for OPVs to realize solution processing are reviewed.

In particular, it is important to develop high‐efficiency polymers that can form thick (>100 nm) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films over large areas with optimal morphologies for charge generation and transport. Here, D1‐A‐D2‐A random terpolymers composed of 2,2′‐bithiophene with various proportions of 5,6‐difluoro‐4,7‐bis(thiophen‐2‐yl)‐2,1,3‐benzothiadiazole and 5,6‐difluoro‐2,1,3‐benzothiadiazole (FBT) are synthesized. It is found that incorporating small proportions of FBT into the polymer not only conserves the high crystallinity and favorable face‐on orientation of the D‐A copolymer FBT‐Th4 but also improves the nanoscale phase separation of the BHJ film. Consequently, the random terpolymer PDT2fBT‐BT10 exhibits a much improved solar cell efficiency of 10.31% when compared to that of the copolymer FBT‐Th4 (8.62%). Moreover, due to this polymer's excellent processability and suppressed overaggregation, OPVs with 1 cm2 active area based on 351 nm thick PDT2fBT‐BT10 BHJs exhibit high photovoltaic performance of 9.42%, whereas rapid efficiency decreases arise for FBT‐Th4‐based OPVs for film thicknesses above 300 nm. It is demonstrated that this random terpolymer can be used in large area and thick BHJ OPVs, and guidelines for developing polymers that are suitable for large‐scale printing technologies are presented."

During the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials, it is vitally important to build the relationship between chemical structures and photovoltaic properties. However, the conventional way based on trial‐and‐error experiments requires a significant amount of time and resources. Here, it is demonstrated that deep learning can be employed to quickly evaluate the performance of new OPV materials. The deep learning model allows direct use of pictures of chemical structures as input, possesses an excellent nonlinear analyzing capability, and has a low demand for computing power. After training the model with a database from the Harvard Clean Energy Project, it is able to predict the photovoltaic performance based on a given chemical structure of an OPV donor material. The prediction accuracy reaches 91.02% using a verification set of 5000 molecules. The codes are converted into visual pictures to understand how features are extracted by the model. In addition, the influence of database size on prediction accuracy is discussed. The model is further tested by using experimentally verified OPV materials and received positive results. Together, the results suggest that deep learning is promising for the quick evaluation of new OPV materials."
281,10.1002/adom.201800051,2018,"Semitransparent Blue, Green, and Red Organic Solar Cells Using Color Filtering Electrodes","Colorful, semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are increasing in demand due to their applicability in aesthetically fashioned power‐generating windows. The traditional method of generating different colors in OPVs has been through employing different active materials exhibiting distinct absorption spectra. This can complicate fabrication processes for production and cause deviations in device performance among differently colored OPVs. Herein, semitransparent and colorful OPVs with a single broadband‐absorbing active material of fixed thickness are demonstrated using Ag–TiOx–Ag color filters (CFs). The CF enables the OPV to transmit spectrally pure colors with peak transmission efficiencies surpassing 25%, and allows the colors to be freely tuned without disturbing the charge transport properties such that the device performance stays consistent. The CF not only functions as an effective electrode but as a mirror for light outside of the spectral transparency window. It is shown that when compared to a transparent OPV consisting of the same active layer material and thickness, CF‐integrated OPVs generate 32.38(±0.03)–34.10(±0.02)% more short‐circuit current. Such results point to a simple and convenient solution to achieving spectrally pure colors, moderate transmission efficiencies, decoupled optical and charge transport properties, and enhanced charge generation relative to a transparent OPV in semitransparent, colorful power‐generating windows."
282,10.1093/cid/civ807,2016,"Interference of Monovalent, Bivalent, and Trivalent Oral Poliovirus Vaccines on Monovalent Rotavirus Vaccine Immunogenicity in Rural Bangladesh.","BACKGROUND
Trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is known to interfere with monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) immunogenicity. The interference caused by bivalent and monovalent OPV formulations, which will be increasingly used globally in coming years, has not been examined. We conducted a post hoc analysis to assess the effect of coadministration of different OPV formulations on RV1 immunogenicity.


METHODS
Healthy infants in Matlab, Bangladesh, were randomized to receive 3 doses of monovalent OPV type 1 or bivalent OPV types 1 and 3 at either 6, 8, and 10 or 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age or trivalent OPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. All infants received 2 doses of RV1 at about 6 and 10 weeks of age. Concomitant administration was defined as RV1 and OPV given on the same day; staggered administration as RV1 and OPV given ≥1 day apart. Rotavirus seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold rise in immunoglobulin A titer from before the first RV1 dose to ≥3 weeks after the second RV1 dose.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences in baseline RV1 immunogenicity among the 409 infants included in the final analysis. Infants who received RV1 and OPV concomitantly, regardless of OPV formulation, were less likely to seroconvert (47%; 95% confidence interval, 39%-54%) than those who received both vaccines staggered ≥1 day (63%; 57%-70%; P < .001). For staggered administration, we found no evidence that the interval between RV1 and OPV administration affected RV1 immunogenicity.


CONCLUSIONS
Coadministration of monovalent, bivalent, or trivalent OPV seems to lower RV1 immunogenicity.

Metal mesh is a significant candidate of flexible transparent electrodes to substitute the current state-of-the-art material indium tin oxide (ITO) for future flexible electronics. However, there remains a challenge to fabricate metal mesh with order patterns by a bottom-up approach. In this work, high-quality Cu mesh transparent electrodes with ordered pore arrays are prepared by using breath-figure polymer films as template. The optimal Cu mesh films present a sheet resistance of 28.7 Ω·sq(-1) at a transparency of 83.5%. The work function of Cu mesh electrode is tuned from 4.6 to 5.1 eV by Ag deposition and the following short-time UV-ozone treatment, matching well with the

PSS (5.2 eV) hole extraction layer. The modified Cu mesh electrodes show remarkable potential as a substitute of ITO/PET in the flexible OPV and OLED devices. The OPV cells constructed on our Cu mesh electrodes present a similar power conversion efficiency of 2.04% as those on ITO/PET electrodes. The flexible OLED prototype devices can achieve a brightness of 10 000 cd at an operation voltage of 8 V."
284,10.1039/c4cp01598c,2014,The use of UV/ozone-treated MoS2 nanosheets for extended air stability in organic photovoltaic cells.,"MoS2 nanosheets obtained through a simple sonication exfoliation method are employed as a hole-extraction layer (HEL) to improve the efficiency and air stability of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). The reduction in the wavenumber difference, appearance of a UV-vis peak, and atomic force microscopy images indicate that MoS2 nanosheets are formed through the sonication method. The OPVs with MoS2 layers show a degraded performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.08%, which is lower than that of OPVs without HEL (1.84%). After performing the UV/ozone (UVO) treatment of the MoS2 surface for 15 min, the PCE value increases to 2.44%. Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy data show that the work function of MoS2 increases from 4.6 to 4.9 eV upon UVO treatment, suggesting that the increase in the PCE value is caused by the bandgap alignment. Upon inserting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) between MoS2 and the active layer, the PCE value of the OPV increases to 2.81%, which is comparable with that of the device employing only PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, the stability of the OPVs is improved significantly when MoS2/PEDOT:PSS layers are used as the HEL. Therefore, it is considered that the use of UVO-treated MoS2 may improve the stability of OPV cells without degrading the device performance."

Herein, we report a cyano-substituted oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (cyano-OPV) derivative that forms five different solvent-free solid-state molecular assemblies, luminescence properties of which change upon thermal and mechanical stimulation. Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis suggested that tolyl groups introduced at the termini of solubilizing side-chains of the cyano-OPV play a pivotal role in its solid-state arrangement. Viewed more broadly, this report shows that the introduction of competing intermolecular interactions into excimer-forming chromophores is a promising design strategy for multicolored thermo- and mechanoresponsive luminescent materials."

However, low power-conversion efficiency (PCE) has impeded the development of OPV cells. The low PCE in OPV solar cells has been attributed to low carrier mobility, which is related to the transport length of the charge carriers within active layers. Graphene can be an ideal material for assisting the charge transport in the active layer of OPV cells due to its excellent charger carrier mobility, thermal and chemical stability, and compatibility with the solution process. In this work, we demonstrated for the first time an improvement of the PCE (up to 40%) in OPV bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) cells by incorporating charge-selective graphene flakes into the BHJ active layer. The charge selectivity of graphene flakes was achieved by nitrogen doping (N-doped graphene). The N-doped graphene, when mixed in the active layer (N-doped graphene/polymer:fullerene composites), provided transport pathways exclusively to specific charge carriers through the modulation of band-gap structures. We discuss further the enhancement of the PCE in OPV cells with respect to charge-carrier mobility."

Oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been the primary tool, however, in rare cases, OPV induces paralysis. In 2013, the World Health Assembly endorsed the phased withdrawal of OPV and introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) into childhood routine immunization schedules. Type 2 OPV will be withdrawn through a globally synchronized “switch” from trivalent OPV (all three types) to bivalent OPV (types 1 and 3). The switch will happen in 155 OPV-using countries between April 17th and May 1st, 2016. Planned activities to reduce type 2 outbreak risks post-switch include the following: tOPV campaigns to increase type 2 immunity prior to the switch, monovalent OPV2 stockpiling to respond to outbreaks should they occur, containment of both wild and vaccine type 2 viruses, enhanced acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance, outbreak response protocols, and ensured access to IPV and bivalent OPV."

This polymer exhibits p-channel charge transport characteristics when used as the active semiconductor in organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices. The hole mobilities of 0.65 cm2 V−1s−1 and 0.98 cm2 V−1s−1 are achieved respectively in bottom gate and dual gate OTFT devices with on/off ratios in the range of 105 to 107. Additionally, due to its appropriate HOMO (5.29 eV) energy level and optimum optical band gap (1.50 eV), PDPP–TNT is a promising candidate for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications. When this polymer semiconductor is used as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor in OPV devices, high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 4.7% are obtained. Such high mobility values in OTFTs and high PCE in OPV make PDPP–TNT a very promising polymer semiconductor for a wide range of applications in organic electronics."

The systematic tuning of the functionalized graphene oxide (GO) WF took place by either photochlorination for WF increase, or lithium neutralization for WF decrease. In this way, the WF of the photochlorinated GO layer was perfectly matched with the HOMO level of two different polymer donors, enabling excellent hole transport. Meanwhile the WF of the lithium functionalized GO was perfectly matched with the LUMO level of the fullerene acceptor, enabling excellent electron transport. The utilization of these graphene-based hole and electron transport layers in PTB7:PC71BM active layer devices led to ∼19% enhancement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to that of the reference graphene free device, resulting in the highest reported PCE for graphene-based buffer layer OPVs of 9.14%.

292,10.1093/infdis/jit601,2014,Immunogenicity and Effectiveness of Routine Immunization With 1 or 2 Doses of Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background. The World Health Organization has recommended that all 124 countries currently using only oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) introduce at least 1 dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) before the global withdrawal of serotype 2 OPV in 2016. A 1- or 2-dose schedule, potentially administered intradermally with reduced antigen content, may make this affordable. Methods. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies documenting seroconversion after 1 or 2, full or fractional (1/5) doses of enhanced-potency IPV was performed. Studies reporting the clinical efficacy of IPV were also reviewed. Results. Twenty study arms from 12 published articles were included in the analysis of seroconversion. One full dose of intramuscular IPV seroconverted 33%, 41%, and 47% of infants against serotypes 1, 2, and 3 on average, whereas 2 full doses seroconverted 79%, 80%, and 90%, respectively. Seroconversion increased with age at administration. Limited data from case-control studies indicate clinical efficacy equivalent to the proportion seroconverting. One fractional dose of intradermal IPV gave lower seroconversion (10%–40%), but after 2 doses seroconversion was comparable to that with full-dose IPV. Conclusions. Routine immunization with 2 full or fractional doses of IPV given after 10 weeks of age is likely to protect >80% of recipients against poliomyelitis if poliovirus reemerges after withdrawal of OPV serotypes."
293,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01864.x,2013,Expert Review on Poliovirus Immunity and Transmission,"Successfully managing risks to achieve wild polioviruses (WPVs) eradication and address the complexities of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation to stop all cases of paralytic poliomyelitis depends strongly on our collective understanding of poliovirus immunity and transmission. With increased shifting from OPV to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), numerous risk management choices motivate the need to understand the tradeoffs and uncertainties and to develop models to help inform decisions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted a meeting of international experts in April 2010 to review the available literature relevant to poliovirus immunity and transmission. This expert review evaluates 66 OPV challenge studies and other evidence to support the development of quantitative models of poliovirus transmission and potential outbreaks. This review focuses on characterization of immunity as a function of exposure history in terms of susceptibility to excretion, duration of excretion, and concentration of excreted virus. We also discuss the evidence of waning of host immunity to poliovirus transmission, the relationship between the concentration of poliovirus excreted and infectiousness, the importance of different transmission routes, and the differences in transmissibility between OPV and WPV. We discuss the limitations of the available evidence for use in polio risk models, and conclude that despite the relatively large number of studies on immunity, very limited data exist to directly support quantification of model inputs related to transmission. Given the limitations in the evidence, we identify the need for expert input to derive quantitative model inputs from the existing data."

In this work, we demonstrate a novel, robot-based, high-throughput procedure performing automatic poly(3-hexylthio-phene-2,5-diyl) and indene-C60 bisadduct nanoparticle ink synthesis in nontoxic alcohols. A novel methodology to prepare particle dispersions for fully functional OPVs by manipulating the particle size and solvent system was studied in detail. The ethanol dispersion with a particle diameter of around 80-100 nm exhibits reduced degradation, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 4.52%, which is the highest performance reported so far for water/alcohol-processed OPV devices. By successfully deploying the high-throughput robot-based approach for an organic nanoparticle ink preparation, we believe that the findings demonstrated in this work will trigger more research interest and effort on eco-friendly industrial production of OPVs."

Here, we demonstrate an experimental strategy which has successfully addressed this challenge. We produced a number of samples of the highly efficient PTB7 polymer with various molecular weights (Mn ∼ 40–220k). OPV cells fabricated with this polymer demonstrated significant improvement of the cell efficiency (by ∼90% relative) and lifetime (by ∼300% relative) with the Mn increase. We attribute these effects to the lower density of recombination centers (persistent radical defects revealed by EPR spectroscopy) and better photoactive layer morphology in the samples with higher Mn. Relevance of the observed correlation between the OPV efficiency and stability is discussed."

It is shown how photo-CELIV and TOF characterizations, using extraction current transients, can give an understanding of degradation mechanisms through observation of the trapping of charge carriers and bimolecular recombination. Examples of deployment and the interpretation of the results are given. It is hoped that this brief introduction will serve as a stepping stone into more in-depth papers and books and encourage wider use of photo-CELIV and TOF technologies which can be employed with whole devices. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry"

In particular, recently proposed solutions to failure mechanisms in different layers of the device stack are discussed comprising both structural and chemical modifications. Upscaling is additionally discussed from the perspective of stability presenting the challenges associated with device packaging and edge protection. An important part of device stability studies is the characterization, and this review provides a short overview of the most advanced techniques for stability characterization reported recently. Lifetime testing and determination is another challenge in the field of organic solar cells and the final sections of this review discuss the testing protocols as well as the generic marker for device lifetime and the methodology for comparing all the lifetime landmarks in one common diagram. These tools were used to determine the baselines for OPV lifetime tested under different ageing conditions. Finally, the current status of lifetime for organic solar cells is presented and predictions are made for progress in the near future."

However, the suitability of steady‐state mobilities to describe charge transport has recently been called into question, and it has been argued that dispersion plays a significant role. In this paper, the importance of the dispersion of charge carrier motion on the performance of organic photovoltaic devices is investigated. An experiment to measure the charge extraction time under realistic operating conditions is set up. This experiment is applied to different blends and shows that extraction time is directly related to the geometrical average of the steady‐state mobilities. This demonstrates that under realistic operating conditions the steady‐state mobilities govern the charge extraction of OPV and gives a valuable insight in device performance."
299,,2017,Enantiopure vs. Racemic Naphthalimide End-Capped Helicenic Non-Fullerene Electron Acceptors: Impact on Organic Photovoltaics Performance,": Impact of the enantiopurity on organic photovoltaics (OPV) performance was investigated through the synthesis of racemic and enantiomerically pure naphthalimide end-capped helicenes and their application as non-fullerene molecular electron acceptors in OPV devices. A very strong increase of the device performance was observed by simply switching from the racemic to the enantiopure forms of these  -helical non-fullerene acceptors with power conversion efficiencies jumping from 0.4% to ca 2.0% in air-processed poly( 3-hexylthiophene ) based devices, thus highlighting the key role of enantiopurity in the photovoltaic while the surface of rac- 2:P3HT blend shows larger coarse domains on the micrometer scale, resulting in a roughness value five times higher in the case of rac- 2 (8 nm) than in P and M - 2 based active layers (1.5 nm). In summary, we have investigated the impact of enantiopurity on the performance of photovoltaic devices by comparing racemic and enantiopure naphthalimide end-capped [6]helicenes as electron acceptors, blended with P3HT donor polymer in OSCs. In this proof of concept, a 5–fold increase of the cells efficiency was recorded going from the racemic to the enantiomerically pure electron acceptor based inverted OSCs. This significant difference was attributed to a different organization of the enantiopure compounds in the solid state, affecting both the charge transport properties and the morphology within in the active layers, resulting in better photovoltaic efficiencies. More than highlighting the potential of helicenes in OPVs, as a new class of NFAs displaying both extended  -conjugation and inherent chirality, this work also suggests that chirality may in some cases have a strong impact on the photovoltaic performance if present within the active layer of a Unprecedented enantiopurity impact on OPV performance was observed with racemic and enantiomerically pure naphthalimide end-capped helicenes as non-fullerene molecular electron acceptors. Blended with P3HT donor polymer, a 5–fold increase of the cells efficiency was recorded going from the racemic to the enantiomerically pure electron acceptor, highlighting the key role of the enantiopurity of the  - conjugated backbone on the self-assembly, charge transport and therefore the overall photovoltaic"
300,10.1063/1.4906915,2015,"Outdoor performance of organic photovoltaics: Diurnal analysis, dependence on temperature, irradiance, and degradation","The outdoor dependence of temperature and diurnal irradiance on inverted organic photovoltaic (OPV) module performance has been analysed and benchmarked against monocrystalline-silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic technology. This is first such report and it is observed that OPVs exhibit poorer performance under low light conditions, such as overcast days, as a result of inflexion behaviour in the current-voltage curves, which limits the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor. These characteristics can be removed by photo-annealing at higher irradiance levels, which occur diurnally as irradiance increases after sunrise. We also report the first temperature coefficients for OPVs from outdoor data; the OPV modules showed a positive temperature coefficient, which compared to a negative coefficient from the c-Si modules. Overall, the cell degradation outdoors appears very severe for these modules and highlights the need for improved barrier."
301,10.1021/am508855s,2015,Tuning Open-Circuit Voltage in Organic Solar Cells with Molecular Orientation.,"The role of molecular orientation of a polar conjugated polymer in polymer-fullerene organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is investigated. A planar heterojunction (PHJ) OPV cell composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is used as a model system to isolate the effect of the interfacial orientation on the photovoltaic properties. The molecular orientation of the aggregate P3HT relative to the PCBM layer is varied from highly edge-on (conjugated ring plane perpendicular to the interface plane) to appreciably face-on (ring plane parallel to the interface). It is found that as the P3HT stacking becomes more face-on there is a positive correlation to the OPV open-circuit voltage (V(OC)), attributed to a shift in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of P3HT. In addition, the PHJ OPV cell with a broad P3HT stacking orientation distribution has a V(OC) comparable to an archetypal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device. These results suggest that, in the BHJ OPV cell, the hole energy level in the charge transfer state is defined in part by the orientation distribution of the P3HT at the interface with PCBM. Finally, the photoresponses of the devices are also shown to have a dependence on P3HT stacking orientation."
302,10.1093/infdis/jiu674,2015,Modeling options to manage type 1 wild poliovirus imported into Israel in 2013.,"BACKGROUND
After 25 years without poliomyelitis cases caused by circulating wild poliovirus (WPV) in Israel, sewage sampling detected WPV type 1 (WPV1) in April 2013, despite high vaccination coverage with only inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) since 2005.


METHODS
We used a differential equation-based model to simulate the dynamics of poliovirus transmission and population immunity in Israel due to past exposure to WPV and use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in addition to IPV. We explored the influences of various immunization options to stop imported WPV1 circulation in Israel.


RESULTS
We successfully modeled the potential for WPVs to circulate without detected cases in Israel. Maintaining a sequential IPV/OPV schedule instead of switching to an IPV-only schedule in 2005 would have kept population immunity high enough in Israel to prevent WPV1 circulation. The Israeli response to WPV1 detection prevented paralytic cases; a more rapid response might have interrupted transmission more quickly.


CONCLUSIONS
IPV-based protection alone might not provide sufficient population immunity to prevent poliovirus transmission after an importation. As countries transition to IPV in immunization schedules, they may need to actively manage population immunity and consider continued use of OPV, to avoid the potential circulation of imported live polioviruses before globally coordinated cessation of OPV use."
303,10.1063/1.4938554,2015,Interfacial thermal degradation in inverted organic solar cells,"The efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells is constantly improving; however, the lifetime of the devices still requires significant improvement if the potential of OPV is to be realised. In this study, several series of inverted OPV were fabricated and thermally aged in the dark in an inert atmosphere. It was demonstrated that all of the devices undergo short circuit current-driven degradation, which is assigned to morphology changes in the active layer. In addition, a previously unreported, open circuit voltage-driven degradation mechanism was observed that is highly material specific and interfacial in origin. This mechanism was specifically observed in devices containing MoO3 and silver as hole transporting layers and electrode materials, respectively. Devices with this combination were among the worst performing devices with respect to thermal ageing. The physical origins of this mechanism were explored by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and atomic force microscopy and an increase in roughness with thermal ageing was observed that may be partially responsible for the ageing mechanism."
304,10.1128/AEM.03575-14,2015,Environmental Surveillance of Poliovirus in Sewage Water around the Introduction Period for Inactivated Polio Vaccine in Japan,"ABSTRACT Environmental virus surveillance was conducted at two independent sewage plants from urban and rural areas in the northern prefecture of the Kyushu district, Japan, to trace polioviruses (PVs) within communities. Consequently, 83 PVs were isolated over a 34-month period from April 2010 to January 2013. The frequency of PV isolation at the urban plant was 1.5 times higher than that at the rural plant. Molecular sequence analysis of the viral VP1 gene identified all three serotypes among the PV isolates, with the most prevalent serotype being type 2 (46%). Nearly all poliovirus isolates exhibited more than one nucleotide mutation from the Sabin vaccine strains. During this study, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was introduced for routine immunization on 1 September 2012, replacing the live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Interestingly, the frequency of PV isolation from sewage waters declined before OPV cessation at both sites. Our study highlights the importance of environmental surveillance for the detection of the excretion of PVs from an OPV-immunized population in a highly sensitive manner, during the OPV-to-IPV transition period."
305,10.1021/acsami.6b02712,2016,Role of Interfacial Layers in Organic Solar Cells: Energy Level Pinning versus Phase Segregation.,"UNLABELLED
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are assembled from a complex ensemble of layers of disparate materials, each playing a distinct role within the device. In this work, the role of the interface that bridges the transparent anode and the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in an OPV device was investigated. The surface characteristics of the electrode interface affect the energy level alignment, phase segregation, and the local composition of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which is in close contact. The commonly used ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode was tailored with a thin, low-band-gap polymer overlayer, called PBDTTPD-COOH, a variant of the established donor polymer, PBDTTPD. Three BHJs that were composed of a donor polymer and PC71BM, were examined, including the donor polymers PBDTTPD, PCDTBT, and PTB7, within the following OPV device stack: ITO/(interfacial layer or layers)/BHJ/LiF/Al/Mg. It was found that modification of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode with PBDTTPD-COOH resulted in statistically significant increases of power conversion efficiency for the PBDTTPD- and PCDTBT-based donor polymer:PC71BM BHJs, but not for the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) enabled determination of the respective energy level diagrams for these three different polymers relative to the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTPD-COOH electrode, and revealed no injection barrier in all three polymer/substrate pairs. The observed differences of efficiency were not, therefore, electronic in origin. ToF-SIMS depth profiling and detailed experiments to determine surface energies strongly suggested that the greatest factor influencing device performance was a significant change of the local composition of the BHJ at this interface. When favorable accumulation of the donor polymer at the


PEDOT
PSS/interfacial layer was observed, the result was higher OPV device efficiencies. These results suggest that for each BHJ, the surface energies of the electrodes need to be carefully considered, as they will influence the local composition of the BHJ and resulting device performance."
306,10.1021/ar5000852,2014,Mesoscopic features of charge generation in organic semiconductors.,"CONSPECTUS: In the past two decades, organic materials have been extensively investigated by numerous research groups worldwide for implementation in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The interest in organic semiconductors is spurred by their potential low cost and facile tunability, making OPV devices a potentially disruptive technology. To study OPV operating mechanisms is also to explore a knowledge gap in our general understanding of materials, because both the time scales (femtosecond to microsecond) and length scales (nanometer to micrometer) relevant to OPV functionality occupy a challenging and fascinating space between the traditional regimes of quantum chemistry and solid-state physics. New theoretical frameworks and computational tools are needed to bridge the aforementioned length and time scales, and they must satisfy the criteria of computational tractability for systems involving 10(4)-10(6) atoms, while also maintaining predictive utility. While this challenge is far from solved, advances in density functional theory (DFT) have allowed researchers to investigate the ground- and excited-state properties of many intermediate sized systems (10(2)-10(3) atoms) that provide the outlines of the larger problem. Results on these smaller systems are already sufficient to predict optical gaps and trends in valence band energies, correct erroneous interpretations of experimental data, and develop models for charge generation and transport in OPV devices. The active films of high-efficiency OPV devices are comprised of mesoscopic mixtures of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) species, a ""bulk-heterojunction"" (BHJ) device, subject to variable degrees of structural disorder. Depending on the degree of intermolecular electronic coupling and energy level alignment, the spatial delocalization of photoexcitations and charge carriers can affect the dynamics of the solar cell. In this Account, we provide an overview of three pivotal characteristics of solar cells that possess strong delocalization dependence: (1) the exciton binding energy, (2) charge transfer at the D-A heterojunction, and (3) the energy landscape in the vicinity of the D-A heterojunction. In each case, the length scale dependence can be assessed through DFT calculations on reference systems, with a view to establishing general trends. Throughout the discussion, we draw from the experimental and theoretical literature to provide a consistent view of what is known about these properties in actual BHJ blends. A consistent interpretation of the results to date affords the following view: transient delocalization effects and resonant charge transfer at the heterojunction are capable of funneling excitations away from trap states and mediating exciton dissociation; these factors alone are capable of explaining the remarkably good charge generation currently achieved in OPV devices. The exciton binding energy likely plays a minimal role in modern OPV devices, since the presence of the heterojunction serves to bypass the costly exciton-to-free-charge transition state."
307,10.1021/am503038t,2014,Bis(tri-n-hexylsilyl oxide) silicon phthalocyanine: a unique additive in ternary bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices.,"Previous studies have shown that the use of bis(tri-n-hexylsilyl oxide) silicon phthalocyanine ((3HS)2-SiPc) as an additive in a P3HT:PC61BM cascade ternary bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ OPV) device results in an increase in the short circuit current (J(SC)) and efficiency (η(eff)) of up to 25% and 20%, respectively. The previous studies have attributed the increase in performance to the presence of (3HS)2-SiPc at the BHJ interface. In this study, we explored the molecular characteristics of (3HS)2-SiPc which makes it so effective in increasing the OPV device J(SC) and η(eff. Initially, we synthesized phthalocyanine-based additives using different core elements such as germanium and boron instead of silicon, each having similar frontier orbital energies compared to (3HS)2-SiPc and tested their effect on BHJ OPV device performance. We observed that addition of bis(tri-n-hexylsilyl oxide) germanium phthalocyanine ((3HS)2-GePc) or tri-n-hexylsilyl oxide boron subphthalocyanine (3HS-BsubPc) resulted in a nonstatistically significant increase in JSC and η(eff). Secondly, we kept the silicon phthalocyanine core and substituted the tri-n-hexylsilyl solubilizing groups with pentadecyl phenoxy groups and tested the resulting dye in a BHJ OPV. While an increase in JSC and η(eff) was observed at low (PDP)2-SiPc loadings, the increase was not as significant as (3HS)2-SiPc; therefore, (3HS)2-SiPc is a unique additive. During our study, we observed that (3HS)2-SiPc had an extraordinary tendency to crystallize compared to the other compounds in this study and our general experience. On the basis of this observation, we have offered a hypothesis that when (3HS)2-SiPc migrates to the P3HT:PC61BM interface the reason for its unique performance is not solely due to its frontier orbital energies but also might be due to a high driving force for crystallization."

To date, monolithic hybrid tandem integration of CQD/OPV solar cells has been restricted due to the CQD ink’s catastrophic damage to the organic subcell, thus forcing the low-band-gap CQD to be used as a front cell. This suboptimal configuration limits the maximum achievable photocurrent in CQD/OPV hybrid tandem solar cells. In this work, we demonstrate hybrid tandem solar cells employing a low-band-gap CQD back cell on top of an organic front cell thanks to a modified CQD ink formulation and a robust interconnection layer (ICL), which together overcome the long-standing integration challenges for CQD and organic subcells. The resulting tandem architecture surpasses previously reported current densities by ∼20–25% and yields a state-of-the-art power conv..."
309,10.1093/infdis/jiy568,2018,Influence of Nonpolio Enteroviruses and the Bacterial Gut Microbiota on Oral Poliovirus Vaccine Response: A Study from South India,"Abstract Background Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is less immunogenic in low- or middle-income than in high-income countries. We tested whether bacterial and viral components of the intestinal microbiota are associated with this phenomenon. Methods We assessed the prevalence of enteropathogens using TaqMan array cards 14 days before and at vaccination in 704 Indian infants (aged 6–11 months) receiving monovalent type 3 OPV (CTRI/2014/05/004588). Nonpolio enterovirus (NPEV) serotypes were identified by means of VP1 sequencing. In 120 infants, the prevaccination bacterial microbiota was characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Results We detected 56 NPEV serotypes on the day of vaccination. Concurrent NPEVs were associated with a reduction in OPV seroconversion, consistent across species (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.57 [.36–.90], 0.61 [.43–.86], and 0.69 [.41–1.16] for species A, B, and C, respectively). Recently acquired enterovirus infections, detected at vaccination but not 14 days earlier, had a greater interfering effect on monovalent type 3 OPV seroresponse than did persistent infections, with enterovirus detected at both time points (seroconversion in 44 of 127 infants [35%] vs 63 of 129 [49%]; P = .02). The abundance of specific bacterial taxa did not differ significantly according to OPV response, although the microbiota was more diverse in nonresponders at the time of vaccination. Conclusion Enteric viruses have a greater impact on OPV response than the bacterial microbiota, with recent enterovirus infections having a greater inhibitory effect than persistent infections."
310,10.3389/fimmu.2017.00685,2017,Patients with Primary Immunodeficiencies Are a Reservoir of Poliovirus and a Risk to Polio Eradication,"Immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) have been isolated from primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients exposed to oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Patients may excrete poliovirus strains for months or years; the excreted viruses are frequently highly divergent from the parental OPV and have been shown to be as neurovirulent as wild virus. Thus, these patients represent a potential reservoir for transmission of neurovirulent polioviruses in the post-eradication era. In support of WHO recommendations to better estimate the prevalence of poliovirus excreters among PIDs and characterize genetic evolution of these strains, 635 patients including 570 with primary antibody deficiencies and 65 combined immunodeficiencies were studied from 13 OPV-using countries. Two stool samples were collected over 4 days, tested for enterovirus, and the poliovirus positive samples were sequenced. Thirteen patients (2%) excreted polioviruses, most for less than 2 months following identification of infection. Five (0.8%) were classified as iVDPVs (only in combined immunodeficiencies and mostly poliovirus serotype 2). Non-polio enteroviruses were detected in 30 patients (4.7%). Patients with combined immunodeficiencies had increased risk of delayed poliovirus clearance compared to primary antibody deficiencies. Usually, iVDPV was detected in subjects with combined immunodeficiencies in a short period of time after OPV exposure, most for less than 6 months. Surveillance for poliovirus excretion among PID patients should be reinforced until polio eradication is certified and the use of OPV is stopped. Survival rates among PID patients are improving in lower and middle income countries, and iVDPV excreters are identified more frequently. Antivirals or enhanced immunotherapies presently in development represent the only potential means to manage the treatment of prolonged excreters and the risk they present to the polio endgame."

Further integration of wireless and self-powered units is of practical importance for implantable bioelectronics. In this study, we developed biocompatible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for serving as wireless electrical power supply units that can be operated under illumination with near-infrared (NIR) light, and organic bioelectronic interface (OBEI) electrode devices as neural stimulation electrodes. The OPV/OBEI integrated system is capable to provide electrical stimulation (ES) as a means of enhancing neuron-like PC12 cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth. For the OPV design, we prepared devices incorporating two photoactive material systems--β-carotene/N,N'-dioctyl-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide (β-carotene/PTCDI-C8) and poly(3-hexylthiophene)/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM)--that exhibited open circuit voltages of 0.11 and 0.49 V, respectively, under NIR light LED (NLED) illumination. Then, we connected OBEI devices with different electrode gaps, incorporating biocompatible poly(hydroxymethylated-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), to OPVs to precisely tailor the direct current electric field conditions during the culturing of PC12 cells. This NIR light-driven OPV/OBEI system could be engineered to provide tunable control over the electric field (from 220 to 980 mV mm(-1)) to promote 64% enhancement in the neurite length, direct the neurite orientation on chips, or both. The OPV/OBEI integrated systems under NIR illumination appear to function as effective power delivery platforms that should meet the requirements for wirelessly offering medical ES to a portion of the nervous system; they might also be a key technology for the development of next-generation implantable bioelectronics."

One of the main tools used in polio eradication efforts has been the live, attenuated, oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) (2), an inexpensive vaccine easily administered by trained volunteers. OPV might require several doses to induce immunity, but provides long-term protection against paralytic disease. Through effective use of OPV, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has brought wild polioviruses to the threshold of eradication (1). However, OPV use, particularly in areas with low routine vaccination coverage, is associated with the emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) whose genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or circulation (3). VDPVs can emerge among immunologically normal vaccine recipients and their contacts as well as among persons with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can replicate for years in some persons with PIDs. In addition, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) (3) can emerge in areas with low OPV coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. This report updates previous summaries regarding VDPVs (4)."
313,10.1534/genetics.116.197103,2017,Improving Response in Genomic Selection with a Population-Based Selection Strategy: Optimal Population Value Selection,"Goiffon et al. introduce the optimal population value (OPV) as a new metric for genomic selection. OPV is based on the maximum possible haploid value... Genomic selection (GS) identifies individuals for inclusion in breeding programs based on the sum of their estimated marker effects or genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Due to significant correlation between GEBVs and true breeding values, this has resulted in enhanced rates of genetic gain as compared to traditional methods of selection. Three extensions to GS, weighted genomic selection (WGS), optimal haploid value (OHV) selection, and genotype building (GB) selection have been proposed to improve long-term response, and to facilitate the efficient development of doubled haploids. In separate simulation studies, these methods were shown to outperform GS under various assumptions. However, further potential for improvement exists. In this paper, optimal population value (OPV) selection is introduced as selection based on the maximum possible haploid value in a subset of the population. Instead of evaluating the breeding merit of individuals as in GS, WGS, and OHV selection, the proposed method evaluates the breeding merit of a set of individuals as in GB. After testing these selection methods extensively, OPV and GB selection were found to achieve greater responses than GS, WGS, and OHV, with OPV outperforming GB across most percentiles. These results suggest a new paradigm for selection methods in which an individual’s value is dependent upon its complementarity with others."

The electron deficiency of the BTI units leads to polymers with a low-lying HOMOs (∼-5.6 eV). Inverted solar cells are fabricated to investigate the OPV performance of the BTI-based polymers and achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 5.5%, with substantial V(oc)s above 0.9 V which are among the highest V(oc)s reported to date for polymer/PCBM solar cells.

315,10.1002/adfm.201808378,2018,Durable Ultraflexible Organic Photovoltaics with Novel Metal‐Oxide‐Free Cathode,"Flexible and stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are promising as a power source for wearable devices with multifunctions ranging from sensing to locomotion. Achieving mechanical robustness and high power conversion efficiency for ultraflexible OPVs is essential for their successful application. However, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve these features by the difficulty to maintain stable performance under a microscale bending radius. Ultraflexible OPVs are proposed by employing a novel metal‐oxide‐free cathode that consists of a printed ultrathin metallic transparent electrode and an organic electron transport layer to achieve high electron‐collecting capabilities and mechanical robustness. In fact, the proposed ultraflexible OPV achieves a power conversion efficiency of 9.7% and durability with 74% efficiency retention after 500 cycles of deformation at 37% compression through buckling. The proposed approach can be applied to active layers with different morphologies, thus suggesting its universality and potential for high‐performance ultraflexible OPV devices."
316,10.1021/nn402883g,2013,Reporting performance in organic photovoltaic devices.,"Research into organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is rapidly growing worldwide because it offers a route to low temperature, inexpensive processing of lightweight, flexible solar cells that can be mass manufactured cheaply. Unlike silicon or other inorganic semiconductors (e.g., CdTe, CIGs), OPVs are complicated by the requirement of having multiple materials and layers that must be integrated to enable the cell to function. The enormous number of research hours required to optimize all aspects of OPVs and to integrate them successfully is typically boiled down to one number-the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device. The PCE is the value by which comparisons are routinely made when modifications are made to devices; new bulk heterojunction materials, electron- and hole-transport layers, electrodes, plasmonic additives, and many other new advances are incorporated into OPV devices and compared with one, or a series of, control device(s). The concern relates to the statistical significance of this all-important efficiency/PCE value: is the observed change or improvement in performance truly greater than experimental error? If it is not, then the field can and will be misled by improper reporting of efficiencies, and future research in OPVs could be frustrated and, ultimately, irreversibly damaged. In this Perspective, the dangers of, for instance, cherry-picking of data and poor descriptions of experimental procedures, are outlined, followed by a discussion of a real data set of OPV devices, and how a simple and easy statistical treatment can help to distinguish between results that are indistinguishable experimentally, and those that do appear to be different."
317,10.1021/JP503578G,2014,Acceptor properties of boron subphthalocyanines in fullerene free photovoltaics,"In this paper, we discuss the use of the typical electron-donor (donor) material boron subphthalocyanine chloride (Cl-BsubPc) and a chlorinated derivative (hexachloro boron subphthalocyanine chloride, Cl–Cl6BsubPc) to act as electron-accepting (acceptor) materials and as replacements for C60, when coupled with tetracene and pentacene as the electron-donor materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A large decrease in photocurrent was observed when C60 was replaced in the pentacene OPVs, although there was evidence of the harvesting of some triplets for the pentacene/Cl–Cl6BsubPc OPV. Large increases in Voc and stability were observed. Photoluminescence quenching, electron mobilities, and photovoltaic device characteristics are also presented and indicate the ambipolar quality of these small molecule organic semiconductors."

Areas covered: We review the risks of continued live poliovirus transmission after OPV cessation and characterize events that led to OPV restart in a global model that focused on identifying optimal strategies for OPV cessation and the polio endgame. Numerous different types of events that occurred since the globally coordinated cessation of serotype 2-containing OPV in 2016 highlight the possibility of continued outbreaks after homotypic OPV cessation. Modeling suggests a high risk of uncontrolled outbreaks once more than around 5,000 homotypic polio cases occur after cessation of an OPV serotype, at which point restarting OPV would become necessary to protect most populations. Current efforts to sunset the GPEI and transition its responsibilities to national governments poses risks that may limit the ability to implement management strategies needed to minimize the probability of an OPV restart. Expert commentary: OPV restart remains a real possibility, but risk management choices made by the GPEI partners and national governments can reduce the risks of this low-probability but high-consequence event."
319,10.1021/acsami.8b14577,2018,High-Performance Near-Infrared Absorbing n-Type Porphyrin Acceptor for Organic Solar Cells.,"While the outstanding charge transport and sunlight-harvesting properties of porphyrin molecules are highly attractive as active materials for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, the development of n-type porphyrin-based electron acceptors has been challenging. In this work, we developed a high-performance porphyrin-based electron acceptor for OPVs by substitution of four naphthalene diimide (NDI) units at the perimeter of a Zn-porphyrin (PZn) core using ethyne linkage. Effective π-conjugation between four NDI wings and the PZn core significantly broadened Q-band absorption to the near infrared region, thereby achieving the narrow band gap of 1.33 eV. Employing a windmill-structured tetra-NDI substituted PZn-based acceptor ( PZn-TNDI) and mid-band gap polymer donor (PTB7-Th), the bulk heterojunction OPV devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.15% with an energy loss of 0.61 eV. The PCE of our PZn-TNDI-based device was the highest among the reported OPVs using porphyrin-based acceptors. Notably, the amorphous characteristic of PZn-TNDI enabled optimization of the device performance without using any additive, which should make industrial fabrication simpler and cheaper."
320,10.1039/C7PY01878A,2018,Advances toward the effective use of block copolymers as organic photovoltaic active layers,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology could allow the inexpensive production of flexible solar cells via a roll-to-roll printing process. However, the performance of OPV devices relies on the formation of a nanostructured morphology of small but well-defined domains of donor and acceptor materials. Covalent linkage of the donor and acceptor material into a single block copolymer material could provide a bottom-up approach to the formation of ideal morphologies, but fundamental and multidisciplinary research is required to overcome the limitations facing the successful application of this material class to OPV. In this review, the evolution of block copolymers as OPV active layers and the strategies of material design, morphology control, and synthesis are discussed. Donor/acceptor block copolymers designed as single material OPV active layers and studies of model systems which contribute to the understanding of donor/acceptor block copolymers are the focus. Coil–coil and rod–coil block copolymer systems are examined to inform the discussion on rod–rod type materials, while the synthesis and application of fully-conjugated block copolymers is emphasized as the foremost material design."
321,10.1093/infdis/jiu222,2014,The new polio eradication end game: rationale and supporting evidence.,"Polio eradication requires the removal of all polioviruses from human populations, whether wild poliovirus or those emanating from the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 provides a framework for interruption of wild poliovirus transmission in remaining endemic foci and lays out a plan for the new polio end game, which includes the withdrawal of Sabin strains, starting with type 2, and the introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, for risk mitigation purposes. This report summarizes the rationale and evidence that supports the policy decision to switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV and to introduce 1 dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine into routine immunization schedules, and it describes the proposed implementation of this policy in countries using trivalent OPV."
322,10.1002/9781119942436,2012,Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells: Krebs/Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells,"Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a new generation of solar cells with the potential to offer very short energy pay back times, mechanical flexibility and significantly lower production costs compared to traditional crystalline photovoltaic systems. A weakness of OPV is their comparative instability during operation and this is a critical area of research towards the successful development and commercialization of these 3rd generation solar cells. Covering both small molecule and polymer solar cells, Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells summarizes the state of the art understanding of stability and provides a detailed analysis of the mechanisms by which degradation occurs. Following an introductory chapter which compares different photovoltaic technologies, the book focuses on OPV degradation, discussing the origin and characterization of the instability and describing measures for extending the duration of operation."

CuSCN possesses desirable HTL energy levels [i.e., valence band at −5.35 eV, 0.35 eV deeper than poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)], which produces a 17% increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) relative to PEDOT:PSS-based devices. In addition, a two-fold increase in shunt resistance for the solar cells measured in dark conditions is achieved. Ultimately, CuSCN enables polymer:fullerene based OPV cells to achieve PCE > 8%. CuSCN continues to offer promise as a chemically stable and straightforward replacement for the commonly used PEDOT:PSS."
324,10.5501/wjv.v1.i4.108,2012,History of polio vaccination.,"Poliomyelitis is an acute paralytic disease caused by three poliovirus (PV) serotypes. Less than 1% of PV infections result in acute flaccid paralysis. The disease was controlled using the formalin-inactivated Salk polio vaccine (IPV) and the Sabin oral polio vaccine (OPV). Global poliomyelitis eradication was proposed in 1988 by the World Health Organization to its member states. The strategic plan established the activities required for polio eradication, certification for regions, OPV cessation phase and post-OPV phase. OPV is the vaccine of choice for the poliomyelitis eradication program because it induces both a systemic and mucosal immune response. The major risks of OPV vaccination are the appearance of Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis cases (VAPP) and the emergence of Vaccine Derived Polioviruses strains. The supplementary immunization with monovalent strains of OPV type 1 or type 3 or with a new bivalent oral polio vaccine bOPV (containing type 1 and type 3 PV) has been introduced in those regions where the virus has been difficult to control. Most countries have switched the schedule of vaccination by using IPV instead of OPV because it poses no risk of vaccine-related disease. Until 2008, poliomyelitis was controlled in Romania, an Eastern European country, predominantly using OPV. The alternative vaccination schedule (IPV/OPV) was implemented starting in September 2008, while beginning in 2009, the vaccination was IPV only. The risk of VAPP will disappear worldwide with the cessation of use of OPV. The immunization for polio must be maintained for at least 5 to 10 years using IPV."
325,10.1021/acsami.5b02202,2015,Molecular-Scale Understanding of Cohesion and Fracture in P3HT:Fullerene Blends.,"Quantifying cohesion and understanding fracture phenomena in thin-film electronic devices are necessary for improved materials design and processing criteria. For organic photovoltaics (OPVs), the cohesion of the photoactive layer portends its mechanical flexibility, reliability, and lifetime. Here, the molecular mechanism for the initiation of cohesive failure in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV active layers derived from the semiconducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) [P3HT] and two monosubstituted fullerenes is examined experimentally and through molecular-dynamics simulations. The results detail how, under identical conditions, cohesion significantly changes due to minor variations in the fullerene adduct functionality, an important materials consideration that needs to be taken into account across fields where soluble fullerene derivatives are used."
326,10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00236,2015,Solution Synthesized p-Type Copper Gallium Oxide Nanoplates as Hole Transport Layer for Organic Photovoltaic Devices.,"p-Type metal-oxide hole transport layer (HTL) suppresses recombination at the anode and hence improves the organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance. While NiOx has been shown to exhibit good HTL performance, very thin films (<10 nm) are needed due to its poor conductivity and high absorption. To overcome these limitations, we utilize CuGaO2, a p-type transparent conducting oxide, as HTL for OPV devices. Pure delafossite phase CuGaO2 nanoplates are synthesized via microwave-assisted hydrothermal reaction in a significantly shorter reaction time compared to via conventional heating. A thick CuGaO2 HTL (∼280 nm) in poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) devices achieves 3.2% power conversion efficiency, on par with devices made with standard HTL materials. Such a thick CuGaO2 HTL is more compatible with large-area and high-volume printing process."
327,10.1002/APP.43679,2016,Inverted organic solar cells using nanocellulose as substrate,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) offer the potential for ultralow cost mass-producible photovoltaic devices. Other advantages are light weight and good mechanical flexibility. To further reduce the cost, the replacement of the conventional conducting substrates for cellulose is an interesting choice. There are three main types of nanocellulose materials: nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), nanocrystalline cellulose (CNC), and bacterial nanocellulose. In this work, the synthesis of two types of nanocellulose substrates and their application in OPVs were achieved. For the first time, the different properties of the cellulose substrates and their influence on the OPV performance were addressed. The nanocellulose substrates CNC and NFC were characterized by XRD, AFM, and DSC. CNC films were more homogeneous, smoother, crystalline and with low roughness. Thus, when comparing the cellulosic substrates, the best device the one based on CNC. The PCE values of the inverted OPV cells were 3.0, 1.4, and 0.5% on to glass, CNC and NFC substrates. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 43679."
328,10.1002/anie.201706142,2017,"A Chiral Recognition System Orchestrated by Self-Assembly: Molecular Chirality, Self-Assembly Morphology, and Fluorescence Response.","The newly developed oligophenylenevinylene (OPV)-based fluorescent (FL) chiral chemosensor (OPV-Me) for the representative enantiomeric guest, 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (1,2-CHDA: RR- and SS-form) showed the high chiral discrimination ability, resulting in the different aggregation modes of OPV-Me self-assembly: RR-CHDA directed the fibrous supramolecular aggregate, whereas SS-CHDA directed the finite aggregate. The consequent FL intensity toward RR-CHDA was up to 30 times larger than that toward SS-CHDA. Accordingly, highly enantioselective recognition was achieved. Application to the chirality sensing was also possible: OPV-Me exhibited a linear relationship between the FL intensity and the enantiomeric excess through the morphological development of stereocomplex aggregates. These results clearly show that the chiral recognition ability is manifested by the amplification cascade of the chirality difference through self-assembly."
329,10.1021/ACSENERGYLETT.6B00716,2017,Outdoor Performance and Stability of Boron Subphthalocyanines Applied as Electron Acceptors in Fullerene-Free Organic Photovoltaics,"The outdoor lifetime and performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) using boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) derivatives as electron-accepting materials is presented. The protocols followed are based on the most advanced level of outdoor testing established by the International Summit on OPV Stability (ISOS). The stability of each BsubPc is compared using three different sets of encapsulated planar heterojunction OPVs, with each set containing a different BsubPc as the electron-accepting layer. The performance and stability of each set is tested outdoors using an epoxy glue and a glass coverslip as protection from the ambient environment. Outdoor testing continued until the OPVs reached 80 or 50% of their original power conversion efficiency, as determined by frequent indoor characterization. OPVs utilizing chloro-BsubPc are shown to exhibit the highest stability and performance, while the stability of the other two BsubPc derivatives is reduced presumably as a result of their phenoxy or phenyl functionali..."
330,10.1039/C4EE03444A,2015,Photochemical origins of burn-in degradation in small molecular weight organic photovoltaic cells,"Using a combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and physics-based degradation models, we find that the early aging of small molecular weight organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is due to photochemical degradation of the C60 acceptor layer. Planar and mixed boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)-donor/C60-acceptor heterojunctions show significant changes in their IR absorption spectra after aging under illumination, which we find is due to exciton-mediated photo-oligomerization of C60. The consequent decrease in exciton diffusion length in the C60 layer results from a decreased exciton lifetime for C60 oligomers (e.g. C120 and C180) compared to that of the monomer. The model describes the short-circuit current reduction in planar SubPc/C60 OPV cells during early aging, and explains the lack of degradation in analogous mixed heterojunctions."
331,10.1021/am508491v,2015,Assessing the potential roles of silicon and germanium phthalocyanines in planar heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices and how pentafluoro phenoxylation can enhance π-π interactions and device performance.,"In this study, we have assessed the potential application of dichloro silicon phthalocyanine (Cl2-SiPc) and dichloro germanium phthalocyanine (Cl2-GePc) in modern planar heterojunction organic photovoltaic (PHJ OPV) devices. We have determined that Cl2-SiPc can act as an electron donating material when paired with C60 and that Cl2-SiPc or Cl2-GePc can also act as an electron acceptor material when paired with pentacene. These two materials enabled the harvesting of triplet energy resulting from the singlet fission process in pentacene. However, contributions to the generation of photocurrent were observed for Cl2-SiPc with no evidence of photocurrent contribution from Cl2-GePc. The result of our initial assessment established the potential for the application of SiPc and GePc in PHJ OPV devices. Thereafter, bis(pentafluoro phenoxy) silicon phthalocyanine (F10-SiPc) and bis(pentafluoro phenoxy) germanium phthalocyanine (F10-GePc) were synthesized and characterized. During thermal processing, it was discovered that F10-SiPc and F10-GePc underwent a reaction forming small amounts of difluoro SiPc (F2-SiPc) and difluoro GePc (F2-GePc). This undesirable reaction could be circumvented for F10-SiPc but not for F10-GePc. Using single crystal X-ray diffraction, it was determined that F10-SiPc has significantly enhanced π-π interactions compared with that of Cl2-SiPc, which had little to none. Unoptimized PHJ OPV devices based on F10-SiPc were fabricated and directly compared to those constructed from Cl2-SiPc, and in all cases, PHJ OPV devices based on F10-SiPc had significantly improved device characteristics compared to Cl2-SiPc."
332,10.1021/MZ300065T,2012,Naphthodithiophene-Based Donor-Acceptor Polymers: Versatile Semiconductors for OFETs and OPVs.,"We report the synthesis, characterization, and OFET and OPV properties of a series of novel naphthodithiophene (NDT3)-based donor-acceptor semiconducting polymers. A striking feature of the present polymers is the very close π-π stacking of 3.5 Å, most likely as a result of the large π system and the D-A system in the polymer backbone. PNDT3NTz-DT, in particular, is found to be one of the few examples of versatile polymers that exhibit both the field-effect mobility of ∼0.5 cm2/(V s) and the PCE of ∼5%. These results indicate that NDT3 is a promising versatile core unit for semiconducting polymers and that the use of highly π-extended heteroarenes as both the donor and the acceptor unit is a promising design strategy to develop high performance polymers."
333,10.1039/C3EE42307G,2013,Towards 15% energy conversion efficiency: a systematic study of the solution-processed organic tandem solar cells based on commercially available materials,"Owing to the lack of scalable high performance donor materials, studies on mass-produced organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices lag far behind that on lab-scale devices. In this work, we choose 6 already commercially available conjugated polymers and systematically investigate their potential in organic tandem solar cells. All the devices are processed under environmental conditions using doctor-blading, which is highly compatible with mass-production coating technologies. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6–7% are obtained for OPV devices based on different active layers. Optical simulations based on experimental data are performed for all realized tandem solar cells. An efficiency potential of ∼10% is estimated for these compounds in combination with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. In addition, we assume a hypothetical, optimized acceptor to understand the limitation of donors. It is suggested that a PCE of >14% is realistic for tandem solar cells based on these commercially available donor materials. Along with the demonstration of novel intermediate layers we believe that this systematic study provides valuable insight for those attempting to realize the high efficiency potential of tandem architectures."
334,10.1021/nn304705t,2013,Hybrid carbon nanotube networks as efficient hole extraction layers for organic photovoltaics.,"Transparent, highly percolated networks of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT)-wrapped semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) are deposited, and the charge transfer processes of these nanohybrids are studied using spectroscopic and electrical measurements. The data disclose hole doping of s-SWNTs by the polymer, challenging the prevalent electron-doping hypothesis. Through controlled fabrication, high- to low-density nanohybrid networks are achieved, with low-density hybrid carbon nanotube networks tested as hole transport layers (HTLs) for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPV). OPVs incorporating these rr-P3HT/s-SWNT networks as the HTL demonstrate the best large area (70 mm(2)) carbon nanotube incorporated organic solar cells to date with a power conversion efficiency of 7.6%. This signifies the strong capability of nanohybrids as an efficient hole extraction layer, and we believe that dense nanohybrid networks have the potential to replace expensive and material scarce inorganic transparent electrodes in large area electronics toward the realization of low-cost flexible electronics."
335,10.1021/jz5017203,2014,Donor-to-Donor vs Donor-to-Acceptor Interfacial Charge Transfer States in the Phthalocyanine-Fullerene Organic Photovoltaic System.,"Charge transfer (CT) states formed at the donor/acceptor heterointerface are key for photocurrent generation in organic photovoltaics (OPV). Our calculations show that interfacial donor-to-donor CT states in the phthalocyanine-fullerene OPV system may be more stable than donor-to-acceptor CT states and that they may rapidly recombine, thereby constituting a potentially critical and thus far overlooked loss mechanism. Our results provide new insight into processes that may compete with charge separation, and suggest that the efficiency for charge separation may be improved by destabilizing donor-to-donor CT states or decoupling them from other states."
336,10.1111/risa.12044,2013,Characterizing Poliovirus Transmission and Evolution: Insights from Modeling Experiences with Wild and Vaccine‐Related Polioviruses,"With national and global health policymakers facing numerous complex decisions related to achieving and maintaining polio eradication, we expanded our previously developed dynamic poliovirus transmission model using information from an expert literature review process and including additional immunity states and the evolution of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The model explicitly considers serotype differences and distinguishes fecal‐oral and oropharyngeal transmission. We evaluated the model by simulating diverse historical experiences with polioviruses, including one country that eliminated wild poliovirus using both OPV and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (USA), three importation outbreaks of wild poliovirus (Albania, the Netherlands, Tajikistan), one situation in which no circulating vaccine‐derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) emerge despite annual OPV use and cessation (Cuba), three cVDPV outbreaks (Haiti, Madura Island in Indonesia, northern Nigeria), one area of current endemic circulation of all three serotypes (northern Nigeria), and one area with recent endemic circulation and subsequent elimination of multiple serotypes (northern India). We find that when sufficient information about the conditions exists, the model can reproduce the general behavior of poliovirus transmission and outbreaks while maintaining consistency in the generic model inputs. The assumption of spatially homogeneous mixing remains a significant limitation that affects the performance of the differential equation‐based model when significant heterogeneities in immunity and mixing may exist. Further studies on OPV virus evolution and improved understanding of the mechanisms of mixing and transmission may help to better characterize poliovirus transmission in populations. Broad application of the model promises to offer insights in the context of global and national policy and economic models."
337,10.1021/JP500547J,2014,Reduced Bimolecular Charge Recombination Loss in Thermally Annealed Bilayer Heterojunction Photovoltaic Devices with Large External Quantum Efficiency and Fill Factor,"Thermally annealed bilayer heterojunction was shown to be an alternative approach to form the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure and yield superior device performance compared to blend-solution-processed BHJ organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The best poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/(6,6)- phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) based bilayer structure OPV showed an external quantum efficiency approaching 82%, a high fill factor of 74%, and the power conversion efficiency of 5.1%, which are higher than those of the blend-solution-processed BHJ OPV devices. In contrast to the BHJ formed from blend solution, richer acceptor, e.g. PCBM, close to the cathode, or different morphology, was generally found in thermally annealed bilayer films. However, the physical mechanism for improved performance in thermally annealed bilayer films was rarely investigated in previous studies. Here, the amount of long-lived photogenerated charges with lifetime longer than 1 μs, which was characterized by the time delayed collection field method, was slightly enhanced by about 5% in the thermally annealed bilayer devices. Nevertheless, the bimolecular recombination coefficient was strongly decreased by 350% with transient photovoltage/ photocurrent measurements, conclusively demonstrating that the significantly reduced bimolecular recombination loss is a major contribution to the increased efficiency in the thermally annealed bilayer OPVs."
338,10.1093/infdis/jiu128,2014,Affordable inactivated poliovirus vaccine: strategies and progress.,"After polio eradication is achieved, the use of live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) must be discontinued because of the inherent risk of the Sabin strains to revert to neurovirulence and reacquire greater transmissibility that could potentially result in the reestablishment of polio transmission. In 2008, the World Health Assembly mandated that the World Health Organization establish a strategy for developing more-affordable inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) options for low-income countries. In 2012, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended universal IPV introduction as a risk-mitigation strategy before the phased cessation of OPV (starting with Sabin type 2) and emphasized the need for affordable IPV options. In 2013, SAGE reiterated the importance of attaining the long-term target price of IPV at approximately $0.5 per immunizing dose and encouraged accelerated efforts to develop lower-cost IPV options. This article outlines the 4-pronged approach that is being pursued to develop affordable options and provides an update on the current status and plans to make IPV affordable for developing-country use."

A comparative study of solution-processable devices has been undertaken to benchmark GO OPV performance with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL devices, confirming the viability of GO devices, with comparable PCEs, suitable as high chemical and thermal stability replacements for PEDOT:PSS in OPV."
340,10.1021/ACSPHOTONICS.5B00202,2015,Plasmonic bulk heterojunction solar cells: the role of nanoparticle ligand coating,"There has been a lot of interest regarding the influence of active-layer-incorporated plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) in the performance of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, while both an increase and decrease in performance have been reported. In this paper, following a systematic approach, we demonstrate strong evidence of the critical importance of the NPs’ ligand shell on the device performance. In particular, it is argued that the plasmonic effect accountable for the performance enhancement takes place only in the case in which the NP’s core is in direct contact with the active layer polymer donor. This can be achieved with the utilization of either ligand-free NPs or NPs terminated with the same polymer donor as the active layer. Using this concept we achieved an enhanced efficiency of 7.16% in OPV devices incorporating the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) active layer. On the contrary, devices with ligand-terminated Au NPs show lower performance..."
341,10.1111/risa.12022,2013,Oral Poliovirus Vaccine Evolution and Insights Relevant to Modeling the Risks of Circulating Vaccine‐Derived Polioviruses (cVDPVs),"The live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) provides a powerful tool for controlling and stopping the transmission of wild polioviruses (WPVs), although the risks of vaccine‐associated paralytic polio (VAPP) and circulating vaccine‐derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks exist as long as OPV remains in use. Understanding the dynamics of cVDPV emergence and outbreaks as a function of population immunity and other risk factors may help to improve risk management and the development of strategies to respond to possible outbreaks. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature related to the process of OPV evolution and information available from actual experiences with cVDPV outbreaks. Only a relatively small fraction of poliovirus infections cause symptoms, which makes direct observation of the trajectory of OPV evolution within a population impractical and leads to significant uncertainty. Despite a large global surveillance system, the existing genetic sequence data largely provide information about transmitted virulent polioviruses that caused acute flaccid paralysis, and essentially no data track the changes that occur in OPV sequences as the viruses transmit largely asymptomatically through real populations with suboptimal immunity. We updated estimates of cVDPV risks based on actual experiences and identified the many limitations in the existing data on poliovirus transmission and immunity and OPV virus evolution that complicate modeling. Modelers should explore the space of potential model formulations and inputs consistent with the available evidence and future studies should seek to improve our understanding of the OPV virus evolution process to provide better information for policymakers working to manage cVDPV risks."
342,10.1002/pssr.201409165,2014,UV/ozone‐treated WS2 hole‐extraction layer in organic photovoltaic cells,"WS2 nanosheets obtained through a simple sonication exfoliation method are employed as a hole‐extraction layer to improve the efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). A reduction in the wavenumber difference in the Raman spectra, the appearance of a UV absorption peak, and atomic force microscopy images indicate that WS2 nanosheets are formed through the sonication method. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of OPVs with and without untreated WS2 layers are both 1.84%. After performing a UV‐ozone (UVO) treatment on the WS2 surface for 15 min, the PCE increases to 2.4%. Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy data show that the work function of WS2 increases from 4.9 eV to 5.1 eV upon UVO treat‐ ment, suggesting that the increase in the PCE value is caused by the band alignment. Upon inserting poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene‐sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) between the WS2 and the active layer, the PCE value of the OPV increases to 3.07%, which is superior to that of the device employing only PEDOT:PSS (2.87%). Therefore, it is considered that the use of UVO‐treated WS2 is able to improve the performance of OPV cells. (© 2014 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)"

Understanding the links between thin-film processing conditions, film nanostructure and photocurrent generation efficiency is necessary in order to develop this technology for commercial viability.

Realizing practical applications of this technology requires the manufacturing of large‐area modules without significant performance loss compared to the lab‐scale devices. In this work, efficient semitransparent OPV modules based on ultrafast laser patterning on both glass and flexible substrates are reported. Solution‐processed metallic silver nanowires (AgNWs) are used as transparent top electrodes. The efficient low‐ohmic contact of the interconnects between the top AgNWs and the bottom electrode in combination with high‐precision laser beam positioning system allow to fabricate semitransparent modules with high electrical fill factor of ≈63% and a remarkable geometric fill factor exceeding 95%, respectively. These results represent an important progress toward upscaling of high‐performance OPV modules with reduced production costs."

In this work, we fabricated a high optical haze film composed of self-aggregated alumina nanowire arrays and applied this novel structure to improve the energy conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. We controlled the optical properties of films, such as total/diffuse transmittance and haze value, by changing the packing density of nanowires during the wet etching process. By optimizing the etching conditions, the nanowire bundle arrays enabled us to obtain an ultrahigh optical haze value up to ∼98% or high transmittance up to ∼96%. By simply attaching the haze film onto the front glass surface of the OPV device, we significantly elongated the optical path length in the active layer, thereby achieving an overall efficiency of 9.01% out of the bare device of 8.17%, resulting in 10.28% enhancement."

Nevertheless, further understanding-based materials developments will be required to achieve full commercial viability. In particular, the performance and durability of many current generation OPVs are limited by poorly understood interfacial phenomena. Careful analysis of typical OPV architectures reveals that the standard electron-blocking layer, poly-3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene:poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is likely a major factor limiting the device durability and possibly performance.

A set of seven commercially available hindered phenols are investigated for use in bulk-heterojunction OPV. Polymer:fullerene films based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are characterized with respect to the initial power conversion efficiency and the long-term stability improvement under illumination in ambient conditions. FTIR spectroscopy is used to trace chemical degradation over time. OPV performance is recorded under ISOS-3 conditions, and an improved long-term performance of OPV devices, manifested in increased accumulated power generation (APG), is found for octadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate.

351,10.1039/C0JM02349C,2011,Determination of energy level alignment at interfaces of hybrid and organic solar cells under ambient environment,"Device function in organic electronics is critically governed by the transport of charge across interfaces of dissimilar materials. Accurate measurements of energy level positions in organic electronic devices are therefore necessary for assessing the viability of new materials and optimizing device performance. In contrast to established methods that are used in solution or vacuum environments, here we combine Kelvin probe measurements performed in ambient environments to obtain work function values with photoelectron spectroscopy in air to obtain ionization potential, so that a complete energy level diagram for organic semiconductors can be determined. We apply this new approach to study commonly used electron donor and acceptor materials in organic photovoltaics (OPV), including poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and ZnO, as well as examine new materials. Band alignments across the entire OPV devices are constructed and compared with actual device performance. The ability to determine interfacial electronic properties in the devices enables us to answer the outstanding question: why previous attempts to make OPV devices using 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) (TIPS)-pentacene as the electron donor were not successful."
352,10.1002/aenm.201400214,2014,Atomic‐Layer‐Deposited Aluminum and Zirconium Oxides for Surface Passivation of TiO2 in High‐Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics,"The reduction in electronic recombination losses by the passivation of surfaces is a key factor enabling high‐efficiency solar cells. Here a strategy to passivate surface trap states of TiO2 films used as cathode interlayers in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) through applying alumina (Al2O3) or zirconia (ZrO2) insulating nanolayers by thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) is investigated. The results suggest that the surface traps in TiO2 are oxygen vacancies, which cause undesirable recombination and high electron extraction barrier, reducing the open‐circuit voltage and the short‐circuit current of the complete OPV device. It is found that the ALD metal oxides enable excellent passivation of the TiO2 surface followed by a downward shift of the conduction band minimum. OPV devices based on different photoactive layers and using the passivated TiO2 electron extraction layers exhibit a significant enhancement of more than 30% in their power conversion efficiencies compared to their reference devices without the insulating metal oxide nanolayers. This is a result of significant suppression of charge recombination and enhanced electron extraction rates at the TiO2/ALD metal oxide/organic interface."
353,10.1039/C4EE02310B,2014,Facile preparation of reduced graphene oxide-based gas barrier films for organic photovoltaic devices,"Reduced graphene oxide-based films were prepared to assess their effects as gas barriers on the stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The direct spin-casting of a graphene oxide suspension onto an aluminum electrode was performed to encapsulate the associated OPV device with a reduced graphene oxide film. The lifetime of the OPV device after the reduction process was found to be increased by a factor of 50. The gas barrier properties of a graphene oxide layer are closely related to its surface roughness and dispersibility. Furthermore, these gas barrier properties can be enhanced by controlling the thermal reduction conditions. The thermal reduction of a graphene oxide film at a low heating rate results in a low water vapor permeability, only 0.1% of that of an as-prepared polyethylene naphthalate film. These results indicate that the dispersibility, surface roughness, and reduction conditions of a graphene oxide film significantly influence its gas barrier performance. Further investigations of the reduction of graphene oxide films are expected to enable further improvements in performance."

355,10.1093/infdis/jit838,2014,Modeling the potential role of inactivated poliovirus vaccine to manage the risks of oral poliovirus vaccine cessation.,"BACKGROUND
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative plans to stop all oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) after wild poliovirus eradication, starting with serotype 2. Stakeholders continue to discuss the role of using inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to manage the risks of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) during the end game.


METHODS
We use a poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model to explore the impact of various routine immunization policies involving IPV on population immunity dynamics and the probability and magnitude of cVDPV emergences following OPV cessation.


RESULTS
Adding a single IPV dose to an OPV-only routine immunization schedule at or just before OPV cessation produces very limited impact on the probability of cVDPV emergences and the number of expected polio cases in settings in which we expect cVDPVs in the absence of IPV use. The highest-cost option of switching to a 3-dose IPV schedule only marginally decreases cVDPV risks. Discontinuing supplemental immunization activities while introducing IPV prior to OPV cessation leads to an increase in cVDPV risks.


CONCLUSIONS
Introducing a dose of IPV in countries currently using OPV only for routine immunization offers protection from paralysis to successfully vaccinated recipients, but it does little to protect high-risk populations from cVDPV risks."

Although internal molecular structure variations are minimal, the presence of the terminal double bond results in a much more compact solid-state structure, dramatically affecting charge transport in the thin films; the hole mobility of 2 is approximately 5x that of 1, and the BHJ OPV power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2 is approximately 2x that of 1. PCEs surpassing 2% for ambient solution-processed devices are demonstrated, the largest so far achieved for squaraine-based organic solar cells."
357,10.3390/v9110340,2017,"Vaccinia Virus Natural Infections in Brazil: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","The orthopoxviruses (OPV) comprise several emerging viruses with great importance to human and veterinary medicine, including vaccinia virus (VACV), which causes outbreaks of bovine vaccinia (BV) in South America. Historically, VACV is the most comprehensively studied virus, however, its origin and natural hosts remain unknown. VACV was the primary component of the smallpox vaccine, largely used during the smallpox eradication campaign. After smallpox was declared eradicated, the vaccination that conferred immunity to OPV was discontinued, favoring a new contingent of susceptible individuals to OPV. VACV infections occur naturally after direct contact with infected dairy cattle, in recently vaccinated individuals, or through alternative routes of exposure. In Brazil, VACV outbreaks are frequently reported in rural areas, affecting mainly farm animals and humans. Recent studies have shown the role of wildlife in the VACV transmission chain, exploring the role of wild rodents as reservoirs that facilitate VACV spread throughout rural areas. Furthermore, VACV circulation in urban environments and the significance of this with respect to public health, have also been explored. In this review, we discuss the history, epidemiological, ecological and clinical aspects of natural VACV infections in Brazil, also highlighting alternative routes of VACV transmission, the factors involved in susceptibility to infection, and the natural history of the disease in humans and animals, and the potential for dissemination to urban environments."

Both systems form well-ordered J-type aggregates in methylcyclohexane, but only hydrogen-bonded arrays afford hierarchically assembled chiral OPV-PERY dye superstructures consisting of left-handed helical pi-pi co-aggregates (CD spectroscopy) of the two dyes that further assemble into right-handed nanometer-scale supercoils in the solid state (AFM study). In the case of hydrogen-bonded arrays, the stability of the aggregates in solution increases with increasing conjugation length of the OPV unit. The well-defined co-aggregated dyes presented here exhibit photoinduced electron transfer on subpicosecond time scale, and thus, these supramolecular entities might serve as valuable nanoscopic functional units."

Current–voltage data in the dark and AM1.5G light show that the TPDSi2:TFB IFL yields MDMO‐PPV:PCBM OPVs with substantially increased open‐circuit voltage (Voc), power conversion efficiency, and thermal stability versus devices having no IFL or PEDOT:PSS. Using PEDOT:PSS and TPDSi2:TFB together in the same cell greatly reduces dark current and produces the highest Voc (0.91 V) by combining the electron‐blocking effects of both layers. ITO anode pre‐treatment was investigated by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy to understand why oxygen plasma, UV ozone, and solvent cleaning markedly affect cell response in combination with each IFL. O2 plasma and UV ozone treatment most effectively clean the ITO surface and are found most effective in preparing the surface for PEDOT:PSS deposition; UV ozone produces optimum solar cells with the TPDSi2:TFB IFL. Solvent cleaning leaves significant residual carbon contamination on the ITO and is best followed by O2 plasma or UV ozone treatment."

361,,2015,"Introduction of Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine and Switch from Trivalent to Bivalent Oral Poliovirus Vaccine — Worldwide, 2013–2016","Since the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis (polio), transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) has been interrupted in all countries except Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. No polio cases caused by WPV type 2 (WPV2) have been identified since 1999, and WPV type 3 has not been detected since November 11, 2012. This progress has been achieved through widespread use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), most commonly trivalent OPV (tOPV), which contains types 1, 2, and 3 live, attenuated polioviruses. OPV polioviruses can undergo genetic changes during intestinal replication, and rarely, in communities with low vaccination coverage, such changes can result in vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) capable of causing paralytic polio. Eliminating the risk for polio caused by VDPVs will require stopping all OPV use. Among 686 cases of paralytic polio caused by circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) that have been detected since 2006, type 2 cVDPVs (cVDPV2s) accounted for >97%. To eliminate the risks posed by cVDPV2s, OPV serotype 2 will be withdrawn from all immunization activities and programs through a global, synchronized replacement of all tOPV with bivalent OPV (bOPV) containing only types 1 and 3 polioviruses. This switch from tOPV to bOPV is scheduled for April 2016. To reduce the risk for cVDPV2 outbreaks and to facilitate responses to outbreaks that do occur, injectable trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is being introduced into routine immunization schedules in all countries. As of June 24, 2015, 90 (46%) of 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member states were using IPV, 102 (53%) had established dates for the introduction of IPV, and two (1%) intended to introduce IPV in 2015 but had not set dates for doing so. In addition to IPV introduction in all countries, careful synchronization of the switch from tOPV to bOPV will be needed within and across all 156 countries currently using tOPV. This report summarizes progress in introducing IPV and preparations for the switch from tOPV to bOPV."
362,10.1002/pip.2226,2013,Cumulative energy demand for small molecule and polymer photovoltaics,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are expected to be a low cost, environmentally friendly energy solution with advantageous properties such as flexibility and light weight that enable their use in new applications. Considerable progress in power conversion efficiencies has brought OPV technology closer to commercialization. However, little consideration has been given to potential environmental impact associated with their production. Although environmental life cycle studies of OPV exist, their scope is narrow or too reliant on outdated technologies. Some of the most significant recent improvements are the result of new semiconductors materials, which have not yet been assessed from a life cycle perspective. Therefore, this study calculates life cycle embodied energy for 15 new materials encompassing a variety of donor, acceptor, and interface compounds showing the most promise in organic electronics. With the use of new inventory data, life cycle energy impact associated with production of both single junction and multi‐junction architectures has been calculated including bulk heterojunction polymer, planar small molecule, and planar‐mixed small molecule devices. The cumulative energy demand (CED) required to fabricate small molecule and polymer photovoltaics were found to be similar from 2.9 to 5.7 MJ/Wp. This CED is on average of 50% less than for conventional inorganic photovoltaics, motivating the continued development of both technologies. The use of fullerenes was shown to have a dramatic impact on polymer solar cells, comprising 18–30% of the CED, despite only being present in small quantities. Increases in device efficiency are shown to marginally reduce CED for both small molecule and polymer designs. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
363,10.1021/ja3086005,2012,Asymmetric noncovalent synthesis of self-assembled one-dimensional stacks by a chiral supramolecular auxiliary approach.,"Stereoselective noncovalent synthesis of one-dimensional helical self-assembled stacks of achiral oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) ureidotriazine (AOPV3) monomers is obtained by a chiral supramolecular auxiliary approach. The racemic mixture of helical stacks of achiral AOPV3 molecules is converted into homochiral helical stacks, as shown by both spectroscopic measurements and molecular modeling simulations. The conversion is promoted by an orthogonal two-point ion-pair interaction with the chiral auxiliary dibenzoyl tartaric acid (D- or L-TA) molecules, which biases the angle population distribution and thereby the stack helicity. The induced preferred helicity is maintained by the OPV stacks even after the removal of the chiral auxiliary by extraction with ethylenediamine (EDA), due to the kinetic stability of the OPV stacks at room temperature. Spectroscopic probing of the helical self-assembly and the racemization process of these π-conjugated OPV chromophores shed further light into the mechanistic pathways of this chiral asymmetric noncovalent synthesis and the kinetic stability of the stacks produced. The racemization of the stacks follows first-order kinetics and no switch in mechanism is observed as a result of a temperature change; therefore, a racemization via disassembly assembly is proposed. Remarkably, the preferred helicity of the stacks of achiral AOPV3 can be retained almost completely after a heating-cooling cycle where the stacks first partially depolymerize and then polymerize again with the still existing stacks being the seeds for self-assembly of achiral AOPV3. Only after a fully dissociated state is obtained at high temperatures, the optical activity of the supramolecular stack self-assembled at room temperature is lost."
364,10.1039/C2EE03478F,2012,Enhanced charge separation in organic photovoltaic films doped with ferroelectric dipoles,"A key requirement for realizing efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is the dissociation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (singlet-excitons) in the donor polymer, and charge-transfer-excitons at the donor–acceptor interface. However, in modern OPVs, these excitons are typically not sufficiently harnessed due to their high binding energy. Here, we show that doping the OPV active-layers with a ferroelectric polymer leads to localized enhancements of electric field, which in turn leads to more efficient dissociation of singlet-excitons and charge-transfer-excitons. Bulk-heterojunction OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester are fabricated. Upon incorporating a ferroelectric polymer as additive in the active-layer, power conversion efficiencies increase by nearly 50%, and internal quantum efficiencies approach 100% – indicating complete exciton dissociation at certain photon energies. Similar enhancements in bilayer-heterojunctions, and direct influence of ferroelectric poling on device behavior show that improved dissociation is due to ferroelectric dipoles rather than any morphological change. Enhanced singlet-exciton dissociation is also revealed by photoluminescence lifetime measurements, and predicted by simulations using a numerical device model."
365,10.1039/C4RA07463G,2014,Fabrication conditions for efficient organic photovoltaic cells from aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles,"For environmentally friendly and cost-effective manufacturing of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, it is highly desirable to replace haloarenes with water as the active layer fabrication solvent. Replacing an organic solvent with water requires retooling the device fabrication steps. The optimization studies were conducted using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as active layer materials. These materials were dispersed in water as blend and separate nanoparticles using the miniemulsion method. Topologies of the active layers were investigated using atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy techniques. We have identified two essential steps to fabricate efficient OPVs from aqueous dispersions: (1) treatment of the hole-transport layer with UV-O3 to make the surface hydrophilic and (2) the use of an electron-transporting buffer layer for efficient charge extraction. We have also identified relative humidity and substrate temperature as key fabrication parameters for obtaining uniform active layer films. The OPV devices were fabricated using PEDOT:PSS as the hole-transport layer and PCBM as electron-transport layer with Ca/Al as the counter electrode. Efficiencies of 2.15% with a fill factor over 66% were obtained; the efficiency and the fill-factor is the highest among all aqueous processing of P3HT–PCBM nanoparticle solar cells."
366,10.15585/mmwr.mm6724a5,2018,"Strategic Response to an Outbreak of Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Type 2 — Syria, 2017–2018","Since the 1988 inception of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), progress toward interruption of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission has occurred mostly through extensive use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in mass vaccination campaigns and through routine immunization services (1,2). However, because OPV contains live, attenuated virus, it carries the rare risk for reversion to neurovirulence. In areas with very low OPV coverage, prolonged transmission of vaccine-associated viruses can lead to the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), which can cause outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis. Although WPV type 2 has not been detected since 1999, and was declared eradicated in 2015,* most VDPV outbreaks have been attributable to VDPV serotype 2 (VDPV2) (3,4). After the synchronized global switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV) (containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) (types 1 and 3) in April 2016 (5), GPEI regards any VDPV2 emergence as a public health emergency (6,7). During May-June 2017, VDPV2 was isolated from stool specimens from two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Deir-ez-Zor governorate, Syria. The first isolate differed from Sabin vaccine virus by 22 nucleotides in the VP1 coding region (903 nucleotides). Genetic sequence analysis linked the two cases, confirming an outbreak of circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2). Poliovirus surveillance activities were intensified, and three rounds of vaccination campaigns, aimed at children aged <5 years, were conducted using monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2). During the outbreak, 74 cVDPV2 cases were identified; the most recent occurred in September 2017. Evidence indicates that enhanced surveillance measures coupled with vaccination activities using mOPV2 have interrupted cVDPV2 transmission in Syria."

Despite this rapid improvement, the mechanisms limiting the existing performance are not completely known; therefore a better understanding of the loss processes is necessary. In this respect a crucial role may be played by the charge transfer (CT) state, which is the intermediate state between the excitons and the fully dissociated charges. In this review article we outline the dynamics of this intermediate state in light of their influence on the photovoltaic performance, with central emphasis on highly efficient polymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells."

It has been demonstrated that they can be manufactured on fl exible substrates and at low cost over large areas using the high volume technique of roll-to-roll printing. [ 1–3 ] Whilst much work has been devoted to the donoracceptor system P3HT:PCBM (poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester), attention is now turning to the use of donor materials which have a reduced energy gap (permitting more of the sun’s spectral emission to be harvested) and an increased ionization potential (leading to an increased open-circuit voltage and thus greater power conversion effi ciency [ 4 , 5 ] ). One promising new donor polymer for OPV applications is PCDTBT (poly [N-9 ′ -heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4 ′ ,7 ′ -di2-thienyl-2 ′ ,1 ′ ,3 ′ -benzothiadiazole)] whose chemical structure is shown in Figure 1 .

369,10.1111/risa.12962,2018,Modeling Poliovirus Transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan to Inform Vaccination Strategies in Undervaccinated Subpopulations,"Due to security, access, and programmatic challenges in areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, both countries continue to sustain indigenous wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission and threaten the success of global polio eradication and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation. We fitted an existing differential‐equation‐based poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model to Pakistan and Afghanistan using four subpopulations to characterize the well‐vaccinated and undervaccinated subpopulations in each country. We explored retrospective and prospective scenarios for using inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization or supplemental immunization activities (SIAs). The undervaccinated subpopulations sustain the circulation of serotype 1 WPV and serotype 2 circulating vaccine‐derived poliovirus. We find a moderate impact of past IPV use on polio incidence and population immunity to transmission mainly due to (1) the boosting effect of IPV for individuals with preexisting immunity from a live poliovirus infection and (2) the effect of IPV‐only on oropharyngeal transmission for individuals without preexisting immunity from a live poliovirus infection. Future IPV use may similarly yield moderate benefits, particularly if access to undervaccinated subpopulations dramatically improves. However, OPV provides a much greater impact on transmission and the incremental benefit of IPV in addition to OPV remains limited. This study suggests that despite the moderate effect of using IPV in SIAs, using OPV in SIAs remains the most effective means to stop transmission, while limited IPV resources should prioritize IPV use in routine immunization."
370,10.1098/rstb.2012.0140,2013,The final stages of the global eradication of poliomyelitis,"The global incidence of poliomyelitis has dropped by more than 99 per cent since the governments of the world committed to eradication in 1988. One of the three serotypes of wild poliovirus has been eradicated and the remaining two serotypes are limited to just a small number of endemic regions. However, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has faced a number of challenges in eradicating the last 1 per cent of wild-virus transmission. The polio endgame has also been complicated by the recognition that vaccination with the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) must eventually cease because of the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-derived polioviruses. I describe the major challenges to wild poliovirus eradication, focusing on the poor immunogenicity of OPV in lower-income countries, the inherent limitations to the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance, the international spread of poliovirus and resulting outbreaks, and the potential significance of waning intestinal immunity induced by OPV. I then focus on the challenges to eradicating all polioviruses, the problem of vaccine-derived polioviruses and the risk of wild-type or vaccine-derived poliovirus re-emergence after the cessation of oral vaccination. I document the role of research in the GPEI's response to these challenges and ultimately the feasibility of achieving a world without poliomyelitis."
371,10.1557/OPL.2015.540,2015,Organic photovoltaic module development with inverted device structure,"The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules with 9.5% (25 cm 2 ) and 8.7% (802 cm 2 ) have been demonstrated. This PCE of the module exceeded our previous world records of 8.5% (25 cm 2 ) and 6.8% (396 cm 2 ) that were listed in the latest Solar Cell Efficiency Tables ver.43 [1]. Both module design and coating/patterning technique were consistently studied for module development. In order to achieve highly efficient modules, we increased the ratio of photo-active area to designated illumination area to 94% without any scribing process and placed insulating layers in order to decrease the leakage current. The meniscus coating method was used for the fabrication of both buffer and photoactive layers. This technique ensures the fabrication of uniform and nanometer order thickness layers with thickness variation less than 3%. Furthermore, the PCE of the OPV under indoor illumination was found to be higher than that of the conventional Si type solar cells. This indicates that OPVs are promising as electrical power supplies for indoor applications. Therefore, we have also developed several prototypes for electronics integrated photovoltaics (EIPV) such as electrical shelf labels and wireless sensors embedded with our OPV modules, which can be operated by indoor lights."
372,,2011,"Update on vaccine-derived polioviruses--worldwide, July 2009-March 2011.","In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate poliomyelitis worldwide. The live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has many advantages favoring its use in polio eradication: it is administered easily by mouth; confers intestinal immunity, making recent OPV recipients resistant to infection by wild polioviruses (WPVs); provides long-term protection against paralytic disease through durable humoral immunity; and is inexpensive. Despite its many advantages, OPV use carries the risk for occurrence of rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis among immunologically normal OPV recipients and their contacts and the additional risk for emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). Because of these risks, OPV use will be discontinued worldwide once the goal of eradicating all WPV transmission is achieved. VDPVs can cause polio outbreaks in areas with low OPV coverage and can replicate for years in immunodeficient persons; therefore, strategies to strengthen global polio immunization and surveillance are needed to limit emergence of VDPVs. This report updates previous surveillance summaries and describes VDPVs detected worldwide during July 2009--March 2011 and reported as of June 20, 2011. Three new outbreaks of circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs), ranging in size from six to 16 cases, were identified in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and India; three previously identified outbreaks in Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Somalia continued through late 2010 or into 2011 and resulted in 355, 37, and 13 total cases, respectively; two countries experienced importations of cVDPVs from Nigeria; nine newly identified paralyzed immunodeficient persons in seven middle-income and developing countries were found to excrete VDPVs; and VDPVs were found among persons and environmental samples in 15 countries. With the use of alternate OPV formulations since 2005 and with enhanced poliovirus surveillance sensitivity and laboratory screening, the number of identified cVDPV outbreaks per year has increased over time . To prevent VDPV emergence and spread, all countries should maintain high poliovirus vaccination coverage against all three poliovirus serotypes. Sensitive poliovirus surveillance to detect VDPVs will continue to increase in importance."
373,10.1063/1.2718865,2007,A microscopic model for the behavior of nanostructured organic photovoltaic devices,"We present a Monte Carlo model of carrier separation and recombination in nanostructured organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices which takes into account all electrostatic interactions, energetic disorder, and polaronic effects. This permits a detailed analysis of the strong morphology dependence of carrier collection efficiency. We find that performance is determined both by the orientation of the heterojunction relative to the external electric field as well as by carrier confinement due to polymer intermixing. The model predicts that an idealized interdigitated structure could achieve overall efficiencies twice as high as blends. The model also reproduces the weakly sublinear intensity dependence of short-circuit photocurrent (ISC) seen in experiment. We show that this is not the result of space-charge effects but of bimolecular recombination. Disconnected islands of polymer in coarser blends result in bimolecular recombination even at low intensities and should therefore be minimized. By including a micros..."
374,10.1039/C7TC04358A,2018,"Photoinduced degradation from trace 1,8-diiodooctane in organic photovoltaics","1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) is a high boiling point solvent additive commonly used to control the active layer morphology of bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) films. OPV devices fabricated using DIO often show improved efficiency, but recent studies have suggested that light exposure may cause residual DIO to react with OPV materials. We use NMR to quantify the amount of residual DIO in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layers, finding that after a typical thermal evaporator high vacuum cycle DIO is still easily observed. This suggests that most completed devices contain trapped DIO. While OPV devices processed without DIO remain stable, devices processed with DIO rapidly degrade under illumination, even if they had undergone sequential heating and vacuum steps to remove the DIO impurity. These results suggest that impurities that can act as radical initiators, such as DIO, can be detrimental even at concentrations as low as 20 ppm by mass."
375,10.1371/journal.ppat.0040030,2008,A Role for NKG2D in NK Cell–Mediated Resistance to Poxvirus Disease,"Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is an orthopoxvirus (OPV) that causes mousepox, the murine equivalent of human smallpox. C57BL/6 (B6) mice are naturally resistant to mousepox due to the concerted action of innate and adaptive immune responses. Previous studies have shown that natural killer (NK) cells are a component of innate immunity that is essential for the B6 mice resistance to mousepox. However, the mechanism of NK cell–mediated resistance to OPV disease remains undefined. Here we show that B6 mice resistance to mousepox requires the direct cytolytic function of NK cells, as well as their ability to boost the T cell response. Furthermore, we show that the activating receptor NKG2D is required for optimal NK cell–mediated resistance to disease and lethality. Together, our results have important implication towards the understanding of natural resistance to pathogenic viral infections."
376,10.1021/ja309524f,2012,A versatile approach to organic photovoltaics evaluation using white light pulse and microwave conductivity.,"State-of-the-art low band gap conjugated polymers have been investigated for application in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) to achieve efficient conversion of the wide spectrum of sunlight into electricity. A remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved through the use of innovative materials and device structures. However, a reliable technique for the rapid screening of the materials and processes is a prerequisite toward faster development in this area. Here we report the realization of such a versatile evaluation technique for bulk heterojunction OPVs by the combination of time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) and submicrosecond white light pulse from a Xe-flash lamp. Xe-flash TRMC allows examination of the OPV active layer without requiring fabrication of the actual device. The transient photoconductivity maxima, involving information on generation efficiency, mobility, and lifetime of charge carriers in four well-known low band gap polymers blended with phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), were confirmed to universally correlate with the PCE divided by the open circuit voltage (PCE/V(oc)), offering a facile way to predict photovoltaic performance without device fabrication."
377,10.15585/mmwr.mm6620a4,2017,"Virologic Monitoring of Poliovirus Type 2 after Oral Poliovirus Vaccine Type 2 Withdrawal in April 2016 — Worldwide, 2016–2017","The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has made substantial progress since its launch in 1988; only 37 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were detected in 2016, the lowest annual count ever. Wild poliovirus type 3 has not been detected since November 2012, and wild poliovirus type 2 was officially declared eradicated in September 2015. This success is attributable to the wide use of live oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs). Since 2001, numerous outbreaks were caused by the emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) whose genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or circulation (1). In 2015, circulating VDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks were detected in five countries worldwide (Nigeria, Pakistan, Guinea, Burma, and South Sudan), and VDPV2 single events were reported in 22 countries. These events prompted the GPEI to withdraw the type 2 component (Sabin2) of trivalent OPV (tOPV) in a globally coordinated, synchronized manner in April 2016 (2,3), at which time all OPV-using countries switched to using bivalent OPV (bOPV), containing Sabin types 1 and 3. This report details for the first time the virologic tracking of elimination of a live vaccine that has been withdrawn from routine and mass immunization systems worldwide (3). To secure elimination, further monitoring is warranted to detect any use of tOPV or monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2)."
378,10.1039/C5EE01763G,2015,Ecodesign of organic photovoltaic modules from Danish and Chinese perspectives,"The life cycle of a solar park made using organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology is assessed here. The modules have been fabricated in a pilot scale plant and they have been installed together with other components to evaluate the balance of system, in a solar park located in Denmark. Three possible waste management practices have been contemplated for the end of life of the solar park: recycling, incineration or the average local mix. The assessment of the environmental impacts of such a system reveals that silver used in the electrodes is overall the largest source of impacts, such as chemical pollution and metal depletion. The establishment of resource recovery systems for the end-of-life management of the OPV modules is therefore crucial to reduce overall environmental impacts. Liability on the manufacturers or on the operators should be implemented. The electricity produced from OPV solar parks yields similar footprints to other traditional energy technologies; e.g. coal and natural gas. However, when the efficiency of the OPV modules is increased from 1% to 5% they are comparable to other mature PV technologies already on the market. The effects of outsourcing or exporting the production of the OPV modules from Denmark to China have additionally been studied to determine the most advantageous configuration. The stakeholders should aim at anchoring the manufacturing of solar parks in countries with stringent emission standards and/or high technology efficiencies, e.g. Denmark, and at deploying them in countries with high solar radiation to maximise the environmental benefits of the PV technology."
379,10.1093/CLINIDS/14.2.568,1992,Epidemiology of poliomyelitis in the United States one decade after the last reported case of indigenous wild virus-associated disease.,"Poliomyelitis caused by wild poliovirus has been virtually nonexistent in the United States since 1980, and vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) has emerged as the predominant form of the disease. We reviewed national surveillance data on poliomyelitis for 1960-1989 to assess the changing risks of wild-virus, vaccine-associated, and imported paralytic disease; we also sought to characterize the epidemiology of poliomyelitis for the period 1980-1989. The risk of VAPP has remained exceedingly low but stable since the mid-1960s, with approximately 1 case occurring per 2.5 million doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) distributed during 1980-1989. Since 1980 no indigenous cases of wild-virus disease, 80 cases of VAPP, and five cases of imported disease have been reported in the United States. Three distinct groups are at risk of vaccine-associated disease: recipients of OPV (usually infants receiving their first dose), persons in contact with OPV recipients (mostly unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated adults), and immunologically abnormal individuals. Overall, 93% of cases in OPV recipients and 76% of vaccine-associated cases have been related to administration of the first or second dose of OPV. Our findings suggest that adoption of a sequential vaccination schedule (inactivated poliovirus vaccine followed by OPV) would be effective in decreasing the risk of VAPP while retaining the proven public health benefits of OPV."
380,10.1021/ja910420t,2010,Solution-processable low-molecular weight extended arylacetylenes: versatile p-type semiconductors for field-effect transistors and bulk heterojunction solar cells.,"We report the synthesis and characterization of a series of five extended arylacetylenes, 9,10-bis-{[m,p-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl]ethynyl}-anthracene (A-P6t, 1), 9,10-bis-[(p-{[m,p-bis(hexyloxy) phenyl]ethynyl}phenyl)ethynyl]-anthracene (PA-P6t, 2), 4,7-bis-{[m,p-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl]ethynyl}-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTZ-P6t, 5), 4,7-bis(5-{[m,p-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl]ethynyl}thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TBTZ-P6t, 6), and 7,7'-({[m,p-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl]ethynyl}-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,4'-ethynyl)-2,5-thiophene (BTZT-P6t, 7), and two arylvinylenes, 9,10-bis-{(E)-[m,p-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl]vinyl}-anthracene (A-P6d, 3), 9,10-bis-[(E)-(p-{(E)-[m,p-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl]vinyl}phenyl)vinyl]-anthracene (PA-P6d, 4). Trends in optical absorption spectra and electrochemical redox processes are first described. Next, the thin-film microstructures and morphologies of films deposited from solution under various conditions are investigated, and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and bulk heterojunction photovoltaic (OPV) cells fabricated. We find that substituting acetylenic for olefinic linkers on the molecular cores significantly enhances device performance. OFET measurements reveal that all seven of the semiconductors are FET-active and, depending on the backbone architecture, the arylacetylenes exhibit good p-type mobilities (mu up to approximately 0.1 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) when optimum film microstructural order is achieved. OPV cells using [6,6]-phenyl C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 1.3% under a simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation of 100 mW/cm(2). These results demonstrate that arylacetylenes are promising hole-transport materials for p-channel OFETs and promising donors for organic solar cells applications. A direct correlation between OFET arylacetylene hole mobility and OPV performance is identified and analyzed."
381,10.1039/C3EE41621F,2013,"Developing understanding of organic photovoltaic devices: kinetic Monte Carlo models of geminate and non-geminate recombination, charge transport and charge extraction","This Perspective discusses the physics, implementation and findings of Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) models applied to organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). It is shown that KMC models can relate morphology and energy levels on the nano-scale to geminate and non-geminate recombination, charge transport, charge injection and charge extraction measured in macro-scale OPVs. In particular, KMC investigations probing the circumstances under which geminate recombination is, and is not, a significant loss mechanism in OPVs are reviewed. Furthermore, the mechanisms which yield non-geminate (bimolecular) recombination in OPVs that is both slower than the predictions of Langevin, and charge density dependent, are discussed. It is also shown how KMC models can predict average mobility, as well as spatial heterogeneity and temporal dispersion around this average value in disordered bulk heterojunctions. Finally, it is shown how KMC can be used to quantify the effect of non-ideal electrodes, interlayers and surface wetting layers on OPV performance."
382,10.1021/am4035416,2013,Effect of local and global structural order on the performance of perylene diimide excimeric solar cells.,"Herein, we present a detailed study of the structure-function relationship in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) blend film composed of N,N'-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) and the low energy gap copolymer of poly[4,8-bis-substituted-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-4-substituted-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-E-O). The hierarchical organization in the photoactive layers and in extruded fibers of PBDTTT-E-O:EP-PDI was studied by fluorescence optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). WAXS revealed a nanophase-separated structure where PBDTTT-E-O domains of 4.3 nm in size coexist with EP-PDI domains of 20 nm size. Thermal annealing results in an increase of the PBDTTT-E-O domains, but it does not affect the size of the EP-PDI domains. Only the length of the EP-PDI columns in each domain is increased by thermal treatment. The photophysical characterization of the PBDTTT-E-O:EP-PDI layers and the electrical characterization of the corresponding OPV and unipolar carrier devices were performed. The quenching of the EP-PDI excimer luminescence is correlated with the photocurrent generation efficiency of the OPV devices. At high annealing temperatures the EP-PDI columnar length becomes larger than the previously reported diffusion length of the PDI excimer, and fewer excimers dissociate at the EP-PDI/polymer interfaces, leading to reduced photocurrent generation. The charge transport properties of the PBDTTT-E-O:EP-PDI blend film were studied as a function of the active layer microstructure that was tuned by thermal treatment. Thermal processing increases electron mobility, but the poor connectivity of the EP-PDI domains keeps hole mobility six times higher. In respect to the as-spun OPV device, a 3-fold increase is found in the power conversion efficiency of the device annealed at 100 °C. The high surface roughness of the PBDTTT-E-O:EP-PDI photoactive layer impedes the efficient extraction of charges, and a thin and smooth perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole overlayer is required for increasing the device performance to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) ∼ 1.7%. The inversion in the polarity of the device contacts resulted in an inverted device with PCE ∼ 1.9%. We provide rational guidelines for the accurate tuning of the layer microstructure in PDI-based photoactive layers of efficient OPV devices. Local disorder in the EP-PDI aggregates is essential (i) for the optimum electron transport that is ensured by the efficient connectivity of the EP-PDI columns in adjacent EP-PDI domains and (ii) for preventing the stabilization of the neutral photoexcitations in the EP-PDI domains in the form of slowly diffusive excimers. The high photocurrent generation efficiency achieved suggests the EP-PDI excimers are formed faster than the activation of triplet states, and photocurrent losses are minimized."
383,10.1021/JP4010828,2013,Interpreting the Density of States Extracted from Organic Solar Cells Using Transient Photocurrent Measurements,"The energetic distribution of trapped carrier states (DoS) in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is a key device parameter which controls carrier mobility and the recombination rate; as such, it can ultimately limit device efficiency. Recent studies have attempted to measure the DoS from working OPV devices using transient photocurrent methods adapted from the time-of-flight (ToF) method originally developed to measure mobility in thick unipolar devices. While a method to extract the DoS from OPV devices using a simple optoelectronic means would be valuable, analysis is complicated by the presence of both electrons and holes in the bipolar organic solar cells. The presence of both carrier species leads to distortion of the extracted DoS due to (a) recombination losses removing carriers from the photocurrent transient thus changing its shape and (b) both LUMO and HOMO DoS features being observed simultaneously in any measurement. In this paper we use a detailed device model to determine the conditions under which the DoS can safely be extracted from the transient photocurrent from bipolar devices. We show that under conditions of reverse bias it is possible to extract the undistorted DoS from a working OPV device. We apply our method to estimate the DoS in a bulk heterojunction solar cell made of a novel low band gap, diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymer blended with (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and solar cells made of poly(3 hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) annealed over a range of temperatures."
384,10.1017/S0950268816002569,2016,"Wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus circulation, and implications for polio eradication","SUMMARY Polio cases due to wild virus are reported by only three countries in the world. Poliovirus type 2 has been globally eradicated and the last detection of poliovirus type 3 dates to November 2012. Poliovirus type 1 remains the only circulating wild strain; between January and September 2016 it caused 26 cases (nine in Afghanistan, 14 in Pakistan, three in Nigeria). The use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been the key to success in the eradication effort. However, paradoxically, moving towards global polio eradication, the burden caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) becomes increasingly important. In this paper circulation of both wild virus and VDPVs is reviewed and implications for the polio eradication endgame are discussed. Between April and May 2016 OPV2 cessation has been implemented globally, in a coordinated switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV. In order to decrease the risk for cVDPV2 re-emergence inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been introduced in the routine vaccine schedule of all countries. The likelihood of re-emergence of cVDPVs should markedly decrease with time after OPV cessation, but silent circulation of polioviruses cannot be ruled out even a long time after cessation. For this reason, immunity levels against polioviruses should be kept as high as possible in the population by the use of IPV, and both clinical and environmental surveillance should be maintained at a high level."

It is well known that light exposure induces color changes in MoO3 (photochromism) and the formation of intermolecular bonds between C60 molecules (photopolymerization). The influence of these photoinduced reactions on the long‐term stability of OPV cells, however, has not previously been studied in detail. Here, a study and discussion of the early (<5 days) aging mechanisms occurring in illuminated ITO/MoO3/organic cyanine dye/C60/Alq3/Ag bilayer solar cells under nitrogen atmosphere is presented. A degradation process at the organic heterojunction is identified and the formation of Mo5+ species during illumination is found to adversely affect cell behavior. For these widely used materials, the results suggest that light processing is a first necessary step before OPV characteristics can be meaningfully rated."
386,10.1542/PEDS.101.2.242,1998,Modulation of the immune system by human milk and infant formula containing nucleotides.,"OBJECTIVE
To determine whether human milk and nucleotides added to infant formula at levels present in human milk enhance development of the immune system during infancy.


METHODS
A 12-month, controlled, randomized and blinded, multisite feeding trial was conducted on two infant formulas: iron-fortified, milk-based control formula (Control) or the same formula fortified with nucleotides (Nucleotide). The level (72 mg/L) and ratio of individual nucleotides selected were patterned after those available in human milk. A third group fed human milk exclusively for 2 months and then human milk or Similac with iron until 12 months of age also was studied. Response to immunizations was chosen to assess development of the immune system. Infants followed the immunization schedule recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1991.


OUTCOME VARIABLES
Antibody responses were determined at 6, 7, and 12 months of age to Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide (Hib), to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and to oral polio virus (OPV) immunizations.


RESULTS
Of 370 full-term, healthy infants enrolled, 311 completed the study (107 Control, 101 Nucleotide, 103 human milk/Similac with iron). Intake, tolerance, and growth of infants were similar in all three groups. Compared with the Control group 1 month after the third immunization (7 months of age), the Nucleotide group had a significantly higher Hib antibody concentration (geometric mean concentrations of 7.24 vs 4.05 micrograms/mL, respectively), and a significantly higher diphtheria antibody concentration (geometric mean of 1.77 vs 1.38 U/mL). The significantly higher Hib antibody response in the Nucleotide group persisted at 12 months. The antibody responses to tetanus and OPV were not enhanced by nucleotide fortification. There also was an effect of breastfeeding on immune response. Infants who breastfed had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers to polio virus than either formula-fed group (1:346 vs 1:169 and 1:192 in the Control and Nucleotide groups, respectively) at 6 months of age.


CONCLUSION
Infant formula fortified with nucleotides enhanced H influenzae type b and diphtheria humoral antibody responses. Feeding human milk enhanced antibody responses to OPV. Dietary factors play a role in the antibody response of infants to immunization."

Natural experiments within a randomised controlled trial of early measles vaccine,"Background BCG and measles vaccine (MV) may have beneficial non-specific effects (NSEs). If an unplanned intervention with a vaccine (a natural experiment) modifies the estimated effect in a randomised controlled trial (RCT), this suggests NSEs. We used this approach to test NSEs of triple oral polio vaccine (OPV). Methods During an RCT of 2 doses of MV at 4.5 and 9 months versus 1 dose of MV at 9 months of age, we experienced 2 natural experiments with OPV. We assessed whether these OPV experiments modified the effect of 2-dose MV in the MV trial. Setting MV RCT conducted in urban Guinea-Bissau 2003–2009. Interventions Natural experiments with OPV due to missing vaccine and the implementation of OPV campaigns. Main outcome measure Changes in the mortality rate ratio (MRR) for 2-dose MV versus 1-dose MV. Results First, the MRR (2-dose/1-dose MV) overall was 0.70 (0.52 to 0.94), but the MRR was 1.04 (0.53 to 2.04) when OPV at birth (OPV0) was not given, suggesting that early priming with OPV was important for the effect of 2-dose MV. The effect of OPV0 depended on age of administration; the MRR (2-dose/1-dose MV) was 0.45 (0.29 to 0.71) for children receiving OPV0 in the first week of life, but 3.63 (0.87 to 15.2) for those receiving OPV0 after the first month of life (p=0.007, test of no interaction). Second, campaign-OPV may have reduced the difference between the randomisation groups since the MRR (2-dose/1-dose MV) was 0.60 (0.42 to 0.85) for children who had not received campaign-OPV before RCT-enrolment versus 0.72 (0.23 to 2.31) and 1.42 (0.70 to 2.90) for children who had received 1 or 2 doses of campaign-OPV-before-enrolment, respectively. Conclusions Bissau had no polio infection during this trial, so OPV0 and campaign-OPV may have NSEs since they modified the effect of 2-dose MV in an RCT. Different interventions may interact to a much larger effect than usually assumed."

We report the synthesis of three highly photostable polymers (PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF2) and their suitability for use in high-performance OPV cells. Under 1 sunlight of illumination in air for 10 h, these polymer films demonstrated remarkably high photostability compared to that of PTB7, a representative polymer in the OPV field. While the PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF2 polymer films maintained 97, 90, and 96% photostability, respectively, a PTB7 film exhibited only 38% photostability under the same conditions. We ascribed the high photostability of the polymers to both the intrinsically photostable chemical moieties and the dense packing of alkyl side chains and planar backbone polymer chains, which prevents oxygen diffusion into the PDTBDT-BZ films. This work demonstrates the high photostability of ..."

After oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation, outbreaks may occur that require outbreak response using monovalent OPV (mOPV) and/or inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Areas covered: We review the experience and challenges with managing vaccine supplies in the context of the polio endgame. Building on models that explored polio endgame risks and the potential mOPV needs to stop outbreaks from live poliovirus reintroductions, we conceptually explore the potential demands for finished and bulk mOPV doses from a stockpile in the context of limited shelf-life of finished vaccine and time delays to convert bulk to finished vaccine. Our analysis suggests that the required size of the mOPV stockpile varies by serotype, with the highest expected needs for serotype 1 mOPV. Based on realizations of poliovirus risks after OPV cessation, the stockpile required to eliminate the chance of a stock-out appears considerably larger than the currently planned mOPV stockpiles. Expert commentary: The total required stockpile size depends on the acceptable probability of a stock-out, and increases with longer times to finish bulk doses and shorter shelf-lives of finished doses. Successful polio endgame management will require careful attention to poliovirus vaccine supplies."
390,,2015,"Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses — Worldwide, January 2014–March 2015","Since the World Health Assembly's 1988 resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis, one of the main tools of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has been the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). OPV might require several doses to induce immunity but provides long-term protection against paralytic disease. Through effective use of OPV, GPEI has brought polio to the threshold of eradication. Wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) was eliminated in 1999, WPV3 has not been detected since November 2012, and WPV1 circulation appears to be restricted to parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, continued use of OPV carries two key risks. The first, vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) has been recognized since the early 1960s. VAPP is a very rare event that occurs sporadically when an administered dose of OPV reverts to neurovirulence and causes paralysis in the vaccine recipient or a nonimmune contact. VAPP can occur among immunologically normal vaccine recipients and their contacts as well as among persons who have primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) manifested by defects in antibody production; it is not associated with outbreaks. The second, the emergence of genetically divergent, neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) was recognized more recently. Circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) resemble WPVs and, in areas with low OPV coverage, can cause polio outbreaks. Immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can replicate and be excreted for years in some persons with PIDs; GPEI maintains a registry of iVDPV cases. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs) are isolates that cannot be classified definitively. This report updates previous surveillance summaries and describes VDPVs detected worldwide during January 2014-March 2015. Those include new cVDPV outbreaks in Madagascar and South Sudan, and sharply reduced type 2 cVDPV (cVDPV2) circulation in Nigeria and Pakistan during the latter half of 2014. Eight newly identified persons in six countries were found to excrete iVDPVs, and a patient in the United Kingdom was still excreting iVDPV2 in 2014 after more than 28 years. Ambiguous VDPVs were found among immunocompetent persons and environmental samples in 16 countries. Because the large majority of VDPV case-isolates are type 2, WHO has developed a plan for coordinated worldwide withdrawal of trivalent (types 1, 2, and 3) OPV (tOPV) and replacement with bivalent (types 1 and 3) OPV (bOPV) in April 2016, preceded by introduction of at least 1 dose of injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) into routine immunization schedules worldwide to maintain immunity to type 2 viruses."
391,10.1073/pnas.1508578112,2015,Amorphous oxide alloys as interfacial layers with broadly tunable electronic structures for organic photovoltaic cells,"Significance The development of system-independent and non–material-specific interfacial layers (IFLs) to facilitate efficient charge collection is of crucial importance for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell performance. Here we report a broadly applicable IFL design strategy using solution-processed amorphous oxide semiconductors where their energetics can be tuned by varying the elemental composition without varying the surface chemistry. Based on the energetic requirements of specific organic active layers, these oxides can be readily designed with dialed-in energy levels. Using OPV solar cells as a test bed, we use a broad series of photoactive bulk heterojunction materials to demonstrate the effectiveness of these electronically tunable oxides for optimizing the performance of diverse OPV material sets. In diverse classes of organic optoelectronic devices, controlling charge injection, extraction, and blocking across organic semiconductor–inorganic electrode interfaces is crucial for enhancing quantum efficiency and output voltage. To this end, the strategy of inserting engineered interfacial layers (IFLs) between electrical contacts and organic semiconductors has significantly advanced organic light-emitting diode and organic thin film transistor performance. For organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, an electronically flexible IFL design strategy to incrementally tune energy level matching between the inorganic electrode system and the organic photoactive components without varying the surface chemistry would permit OPV cells to adapt to ever-changing generations of photoactive materials. Here we report the implementation of chemically/environmentally robust, low-temperature solution-processed amorphous transparent semiconducting oxide alloys, In-Ga-O and Ga-Zn-Sn-O, as IFLs for inverted OPVs. Continuous variation of the IFL compositions tunes the conduction band minima over a broad range, affording optimized OPV power conversion efficiencies for multiple classes of organic active layer materials and establishing clear correlations between IFL/photoactive layer energetics and device performance."
392,10.1021/nl303419n,2012,Fluorinated copper phthalocyanine nanowires for enhancing interfacial electron transport in organic solar cells.,"Zinc oxide is a promising candidate as an interfacial layer (IFL) in inverted organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to the n-type semiconducting properties as well as chemical and environmental stability. Such ZnO layers collect electrons at the transparent electrode, typically indium tin oxide (ITO). However, the significant resistivity of ZnO IFLs and an energetic mismatch between the ZnO and the ITO layers hinder optimum charge collection. Here we report that inserting nanoscopic copper hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F(16)CuPc) layers, as thin films or nanowires, between the ITO anode and the ZnO IFL increases OPV performance by enhancing interfacial electron transport. In inverted P3HT:PC(61)BM cells, insertion of F(16)CuPc nanowires increases the short circuit current density (J(sc)) versus cells with only ZnO layers, yielding an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼3.6% vs ∼3.0% for a control without the nanowire layer. Similar effects are observed for inverted PTB7:PC(71)BM cells where the PCE is increased from 8.1% to 8.6%. X-ray scattering, optical, and electrical measurements indicate that the performance enhancement is ascribable to both favorable alignment of the nanowire π-π stacking axes parallel to the photocurrent flow and to the increased interfacial layer-active layer contact area. These findings identify a promising strategy to enhance inverted OPV performance by inserting anisotropic nanostructures with π-π stacking aligned in the photocurrent flow direction."

We have produced an OPV device without an HTL exhibiting an NREL-certified efficiency of 2.65% and a short-circuit current density of 11.2 mA/cm2. Our results demonstrate that SWNT networks can be used to replace both ITO and the HTL in efficient OPV devices and that the HTL serves distinctly different roles in ITO- and SWNT-based devices.

In this work, efficient OPV are demonstrated in which calcium electrodes were avoided by depositing a thin layer of the amine-containing nonconjugated polymer, polyethylenimine (PEIE), between the photoactive organic semiconductor layer and stable metal electrodes such as aluminum, silver, or gold. Devices with structure ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/poly(3-hexylthiophene):indene-C60-bis-adduct (P3HT:ICBA)/PEIE/Al demonstrated overall photovoltaic device performance comparable to devices containing calcium electron-collecting electrodes, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ICBA/Ca/Al, with open-circuit voltage of 775±6 mV, short-circuit current density of 9.1±0.5 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.65±0.01, and power conversion efficiency of 4.6±0.3%, averaged over 5 devices at 1 sun."
395,10.1093/infdis/jiu436,2014,An assessment of the reasons for oral poliovirus vaccine refusals in northern Nigeria.,"BACKGROUND
Accumulation of susceptible children whose caregivers refuse to accept oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) contributes to the spread of poliovirus in Nigeria.


METHODS
During and immediately following the OPV campaign in October 2012, polio eradication partners conducted a study among households in which the vaccine was refused, using semistructured questionnaires. The selected study districts had a history of persistent OPV refusals in previous campaigns.


RESULTS
Polio risk perception was low among study participants. The majority (59%) of participants believed that vaccination was either not necessary or would not be helpful, and 30% thought it might be harmful. Religious beliefs were an important driver in the way people understood disease. Fifty-two percent of 48 respondents reported that illnesses were due to God's will and/or destiny and that only God could protect them against illnesses. Only a minority (14%) of respondents indicated that polio was a significant problem in their community.


CONCLUSIONS
Caregivers refuse OPV largely because of poor polio risk perception and religious beliefs. Communication strategies should, therefore, aim to increase awareness of polio as a real health threat and educate communities about the safety of the vaccine. In addition, polio eradication partners should collaborate with other agencies and ministries to improve total primary healthcare packages to address identified unmet health and social needs."
396,10.1039/c4cp04412f,2014,Dual use of tantalum disulfides as hole and electron extraction layers in organic photovoltaic cells.,"UV/ozone treated (UVO-treated) TaS2 and non-treated TaS2 nanosheets are introduced into organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) as hole extraction layers (HEL) and electron extraction layers (EEL). TaS2 nanosheets are obtained via ultrasonic vibration and size-controlled by centrifugation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images reveal that the thickness and lateral size of TaS2 nanosheets are approximately 1 and 70 nm, indicating that uniform and ultrathin TaS2 nanosheets are obtained. The work function of TaS2 increases from 4.4 eV to 4.9-5.1 eV after applying UVO treatment by forming Ta2O5. In addition, the power conversion efficiencies of normal OPV with UVO-treated TaS2 and inverted OPV with TaS2 are 3.06 and 2.73%, which are higher than those of OPV without TaS2 (1.56% for normal OPV and 0.22% for inverted OPV). These results indicate that TaS2 is a promising material for HEL and EEL layers in OPVs."
397,10.1093/infdis/jit671,2014,Intestinal immunity is a determinant of clearance of poliovirus after oral vaccination.,"BACKGROUND
Response to challenge with live, attenuated, oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a measure of immunity induced by prior immunization.


METHODS
Using stool samples from a study from Oman in which an initial schedule of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was followed by an OPV type 1 challenge, we quantitated virus shed, sequenced capsid proteins of recovered virus, and developed assays for neutralization of poliovirus and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) detection.


RESULTS
Neutralizing activity correlated with detection of polio-specific IgA in stool suspensions collected 7 days after OPV type 1 challenge. Both neutralization and IgA in stool were associated with cessation of virus shedding by day 7. Rapid development of an IgA response with cessation of shedding suggests that IPV primed for the early response to challenge. Correlation of neutralization activity and IgA detection provides evidence that polio-specific IgA intestinal antibody is a determinant of mucosal shedding/transmission and that IgA functions through neutralization of virus. In contrast, neither presence nor quantity of serum or intestinal antibody induced by IPV prior to challenge correlated with cessation of shedding.


CONCLUSIONS
These assays provide an opportunity to study other immunization schedules to gain a broader understanding of the appearance and duration of a protective mucosal response to polio vaccination."
398,10.1002/anie.201402568,2014,Organic photovoltaics: elucidating the ultra-fast exciton dissociation mechanism in disordered materials.,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) offer the opportunity for cheap, lightweight and mass-producible devices. However, an incomplete understanding of the charge generation process, in particular the timescale of dynamics and role of exciton diffusion, has slowed further progress in the field. We report a new Kinetic Monte Carlo model for the exciton dissociation mechanism in OPVs that addresses the origin of ultra-fast (<1 ps) dissociation by incorporating exciton delocalization. The model reproduces experimental results, such as the diminished rapid dissociation with increasing domain size, and also lends insight into the interplay between mixed domains, domain geometry, and exciton delocalization. Additionally, the model addresses the recent dispute on the origin of ultra-fast exciton dissociation by comparing the effects of exciton delocalization and impure domains on the photo-dynamics.This model provides insight into exciton dynamics that can advance our understanding of OPV structure-function relationships."

Cells containing SubPc as a direct replacement for C60 exhibit an ∼60% improvement in open circuit voltage (Voc) achieving a maximum Voc of 1.24 V, which is amongst the highest values acheived to date for SHJ devices. This resulted in an overall improvement of ∼60% in power conversion efficiency from 1.8%, for Tc/C60 cells, to 2.9% for Tc/SubPc. The OPV device results are complemented by soft X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements of the interfacial energetics of both systems. The results demonstrate that SubPc shows considerable promise as an electron acceptor material for future cell designs."

While the efficiencies of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been improving rapidly, they are currently below that required for widespread power generation. OPV performance is sensitive to the nanoscale texture, or film morphology, in the photovoltaic active layer, particularly in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices, and characterizing morphology across many length scales is currently a major experimental challenge. Here, we discuss several different experimental approaches for characterizing morphology in BHJ systems. These include techniques ranging from X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy to electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy. These methods provide complementary information to guide future materials design and device optimization efforts."

Molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 ) HTLs have attracted much interest, in part because while they are typically vacuum deposited, [ 4 , 6–8 ] several recent reports have shown that solution deposited MoO 3 HTLs result in OPV devices with performance comparable to that of poly(ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), the most commonly used solution processed HTL. [ 10–13 ] However, all reports thus far have utilized a conventional device architecture, where MoO 3 was deposited before the active layer, because a post-deposition processing step must be performed either at high temperature ( ≥ 160 ° C) [ 10–12 ] and/or in an O 2 -containing ambient. [ 13 ] If these approaches were used to deposit MoO 3 on top of the active layer, e.g. in an inverted architecture ( Figure 1 b, inset), the post-deposition processing would degrade the active layer. Furthermore, the solvents utilized in the published reports have not been optimized to wet the organic active layer, and the ability to deposit a uniform thin fi lm (10 nm) of MoO 3 on the active layer has not been demonstrated. Thus, thermal and wetting issues have precluded the use of solution processed MoO 3 in an inverted OPV device architecture so far, despite the"
402,10.1021/es402969c,2013,Thin-film photovoltaic cells: long-term metal(loid) leaching at their end-of-life.,"The photovoltaic effect of thin-film copper indium gallium selenide cells (CIGS) is conferred by the latter elements. Organic photovoltaic cells (OPV), relying on organic light-absorbing molecules, also contain a variety of metals (e.g., Zn, Al, In, Sn, Ag). The environmental impact of such technologies is largely unknown, in particular when the physical integrity deteriorates upon end-of-life, possibly facilitating cell constituent leaching. This study analyzed long-term inorganic leaching from damaged OPV and CIGS into different model waters. Leachate concentrations were put into perspective by calculating the predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) for several scenarios. Roof-top acidic rain runoff from CIGS was found to be the predominant emission source for metals and metalloids, with Cd released to such extents that PEC (173.4 μg Cd L(-1)) would considerably exceed acute toxicity concentrations for Daphnia magna . Other PEC for CIGS (9.9 mg Mo L(-1) and 9.4 μg Se L(-1)) were in the range of teratogenic effects. In contrast, OPV released little metals with calculated PEC being below even conservative drinking water guidelines. Time-resolved single-particle ICP-MS indicated that some metals (Zn, Mo, Ag) were in nanoparticulate form, raising nanotoxicity concerns. Leaching kinetics called for revision of existing standardized (accelerated) leaching protocols because long-term release was most relevant."
403,10.1021/ja9059359,2009,All-polymer photovoltaic devices of poly(3-(4-n-octyl)-phenylthiophene) from Grignard Metathesis (GRIM) polymerization.,"The synthesis of poly[3-(4-n-octyl)-phenylthiophene] (POPT) from Grignard Metathesis (GRIM) is reported. GRIM POPT is found to have favorable electronic, optical, and processing properties for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Space-charge limited current and field effect transistor measurements for POPT yielded hole mobilities of 1 x 10(-4) cm(2)/(V s) and 0.05 cm(2)/(V s), respectively. Spincasting GRIM POPT from chlorobenzene yields a thin film with a 1.8 eV band gap, and PC(61)BM:POPT bulk heterojection devices provide a peak performance of 3.1%. Additionally, an efficiency of 2.0% is achieved in an all-polymer, bilayer OPV using poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-(1-cyanovinylene)phenylene] (CNPPV) as an acceptor. This state-of-the-art all-polymer device is analyzed in comparison to the analogous poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/CNPPV device. Counter to expectations based on more favorable energy level alignment, greater active layer light absorption, and similar hole mobility, P3HT/CNPPV devices perform less well than POPT/CNPPV devices with a peak efficiency of 0.93%."

Electrochemical and photophysical studies have revealed that ground-state electronic interactions between the covalently bonded OPV moiety and the fullerene sphere are small. The photophysical investigations have also shown that both in dichloromethane and benzonitrile solution an efficient singlet−singlet OPV → C60 photoinduced energy-transfer process takes place, and occurrence of electron transfer, if any, is by far negligible relative to energy transfer. The C60−OPV derivatives have been incorporated in photovoltaic devices, and a photocurrent could be observed showing that photoinduced electron transfer does take place under these conditions. However, the efficiency of the devices is limited by the fact that photoinduced electron transfer from the OPV..."
405,10.1002/adma.201001010,2010,Direct Measurement of Electric Field‐Assisted Charge Separation in Polymer:Fullerene Photovoltaic Diodes,"Efforts to improve OPV cells must be underpinned by a clear and quantitative understanding of photocurrent generation and loss mechanisms, in particular the mechanism by which the electric fi eld determines the current-voltage characteristics of OPV cells. While the processes of photon absorption to create excitons, and exciton dissociation to create electrons and holes across donor-acceptor interfaces are well understood and independent of electric fi eld, [ 3 ] there are confl icting models for what happens subsequently. On the one hand, if interfacial charge pairs are Coulombically bound, the effect of an electric fi eld would be to dissociate geminate charge pairs and allow them to contribute to photocurrent. [ 4–10 ] On the other hand, if photoinduced charge transfer leads to fully separated electrons and holes, independent of electric fi eld, then the observed effect of the electric fi eld must be to suppress bimolecular recombination during charge extraction. [ 11–16 ] Here, we present the biasdependence of time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy in a working OPV device. This technique allows us to distinguish between the two models of photocurrent generation by directly observing the effect of an electric fi eld on charge dynamics. This is a challenging experiment because, as we demonstrate below, the high instantaneous excitation densities generally required in transient optical absorption spectroscopy can greatly reduce PV effi ciency. Yet, the extent to which pulse energies can be attenuated to mitigate the effect of strongly modulated excitation densities is constrained by the sensitivity of signal detection. We show here that it is possible to access a suffi ciently low intensity regime to be of relevance to the operation mechanism of OPVs under solar illumination. We fi nd that charge lifetimes are extended under reverse bias, revealing that the mechanism of photocurrent generation is the electric fi eld-assisted separation of Coulombically bound charge pairs in kinetic competition with geminate charge recombination.

406,10.1371/journal.pone.0079953,2013,Genome-Wide Comparison of Cowpox Viruses Reveals a New Clade Related to Variola Virus,"Zoonotic infections caused by several orthopoxviruses (OPV) like monkeypox virus or vaccinia virus have a significant impact on human health. In Europe, the number of diagnosed infections with cowpox viruses (CPXV) is increasing in animals as well as in humans. CPXV used to be enzootic in cattle; however, such infections were not being diagnosed over the last decades. Instead, individual cases of cowpox are being found in cats or exotic zoo animals that transmit the infection to humans. Both animals and humans reveal local exanthema on arms and legs or on the face. Although cowpox is generally regarded as a self-limiting disease, immunosuppressed patients can develop a lethal systemic disease resembling smallpox. To date, only limited information on the complex and, compared to other OPV, sparsely conserved CPXV genomes is available. Since CPXV displays the widest host range of all OPV known, it seems important to comprehend the genetic repertoire of CPXV which in turn may help elucidate specific mechanisms of CPXV pathogenesis and origin. Therefore, 22 genomes of independent CPXV strains from clinical cases, involving ten humans, four rats, two cats, two jaguarundis, one beaver, one elephant, one marah and one mongoose, were sequenced by using massive parallel pyrosequencing. The extensive phylogenetic analysis showed that the CPXV strains sequenced clearly cluster into several distinct clades, some of which are closely related to Vaccinia viruses while others represent different clades in a CPXV cluster. Particularly one CPXV clade is more closely related to Camelpox virus, Taterapox virus and Variola virus than to any other known OPV. These results support and extend recent data from other groups who postulate that CPXV does not form a monophyletic clade and should be divided into multiple lineages."

The recombination parameter α can be obtained from the power law fitting of short-circuit current (Jsc) on illumination intensity (I),  Jsc∝Iα, with α values less than unity taken as an indication of reduced photon-to-electron extraction efficiency and the presence of bimolecular recombination in OPV. Here, we show that this intensity-averaged measurement is inadequate. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) apparatus under constant white-light bias can be used to measure the recombination parameter (αEQE*) as a function of wavelength and carrier density (white-light intensity).

408,10.1021/acsami.8b14224,2018,Impact of ZnO Photoluminescence on Organic Photovoltaic Performance.,"ZnO is a widely used electron transport material in third generation solar cells. Intrinsic defects arising from different synthetic methods and conditions lead to different fluorescent colors. The defect mechanisms have been explored in the literature, but their impact on organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell performance is rarely reported. Herein, three different ZnO nanoparticles showing blue, green, and yellow emission colors are synthesized and incorporated into OPV cells. The as-cast ZnO films result in vastly different OPV performances. It is found the sodium acetate as the byproduct of the synthesis can significantly influence the interfacial contact. After removing the impurity via rinsing with polar organic solvents, the different ZnO nanoparticles can deliver similar power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in three representative OPV systems. The PCEs reached 4, 8, and 10% in P3HT:PC61BM-, PTB7-Th:PC71BM-, and PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F-based OPV cells, respectively. A series of characterizations indicate that the intrinsic defect types do not affect the optical and electrical properties of the ZnO film, including photon transmittance, electrical conductivity, and charge extraction from the active layer as well as electron mobility. The results together suggest that the intrinsic defect in ZnO nanoparticles has little impact on OPV performance. Thus, it might be necessary to revisit the strategies for defect engineering or passivation in oxide-based interfacial materials."

410,10.1021/ar900096f,2009,Oxide contacts in organic photovoltaics: characterization and control of near-surface composition in indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.,"The recent improvements in the power conversion efficiencies of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) promise to make these technologies increasingly attractive alternatives to more established photovoltaic technologies. OPVs typically consist of photoactive layers 20-100 nm thick sandwiched between both transparent oxide and metallic electrical contacts. Ideal OPVs rely on ohmic top and bottom contacts to harvest photogenerated charges without compromising the power conversion efficiency of the OPV. Unfortunately, the electrical contact materials (metals and metal oxides) and the active organic layers in OPVs are often incompatible and may be poorly optimized for harvesting photogenerated charges. Therefore, further optimization of the chemical and physical stabilities of these metal oxide materials with organic materials will be an essential component of the development of OPV technologies. The energetic and kinetic barriers to charge injection/collection must be minimized to maximize OPV power conversion efficiencies. In this Account, we review recent studies of one of the most common transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), indium-tin oxide (ITO), which is the transparent bottom contact in many OPV technologies. These studies of the surface chemistry and surface modification of ITO are also applicable to other TCO materials. Clean, freshly deposited ITO is intrinsically reactive toward H(2)O, CO, CO(2), etc. and is often chemically and electrically heterogeneous in the near-surface region. Conductive-tip atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) studies reveal significant spatial variability in electrical properties. We describe the use of acid activation, small-molecule chemisorption, and electrodeposition of conducting polymer films to tune the surface free energy, the effective work function, and electrochemical reactivity of ITO surfaces. Certain electrodeposited poly(thiophenes) show their own photovoltaic activity or can be used as electronically tunable substrates for other photoactive layers. For certain photoactive donor layers (phthalocyanines), we have used the polarity of the oxide surface to accelerate dewetting and ""nanotexturing"" of the donor layer to enhance OPV performance. These complex surface chemistries will make oxide/organic interfaces one of the key focal points for research in new OPV technologies."

Wet-chemically prepared ZnO and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were used as buffer layers. Particularly, for PEDOT:PSS deposition, no annealing step was employed. This inverted OPV showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼7.0%, which is comparable to the hitherto reported highest efficiency of the inverted OPV with vacuum-deposited MoO3 as hole-collecting buffer layers without plasmonic enhancements. Incorporation of Au nanoparticles into PEDOT:PSS was performed for plasmonic enhancement of the electromagnetic field, whereas ZnO thin layers were deposited on ZnO using atomic layer deposition for quenching electron–hole recombination at surface defects of ZnO ripples. These additional treatments could be used for improving the performance of OPV, which ultimately resulted in a PCE of 7.9%."

The corresponding OPV proteins comprise those known to be essential for replication as well as many that are still uncharacterized, including 2 of less than 60 amino acids that had not been previously noted. The OPV proteins most highly conserved in MCV are involved in transcription; the least conserved include membrane glycoproteins. Twenty of the MCV proteins with OPV counterparts also have cellular homologs and additional MCV proteins have conserved functional motifs. Of the 77 predicted MCV proteins without OPV counterparts, 10 have similarity to other MCV proteins and/or distant similarity to proteins of other poxviruses and 16 have cellular homologs including some predicted to antagonize host defenses. Clustering poxvirus proteins by sequence similarity revealed 3 unique MCV gene families and 8 families that are conserved in MCV and OPV. Two unique families contain putative membrane receptors; the third includes 2 proteins, each containing 2 DED apoptosis signal transduction domains. Additional families with conserved patterns of cysteines and putative redox active centers were identified. Promoters, transcription termination signals, and DNA concatemer resolution sequences are highly conserved in MCV and OPV. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that MCV, OPV, and leporipoxviruses radiated from a common poxvirus ancestor after the divergence of avipoxviruses. Despite the acquisition of unique genes for host interactions and changes in GC content, the physical order and regulation of essential ancestral poxvirus genes have been largely conserved in MCV and OPV."

For this purpose, the stability enhancement of bulk heterojunction OPV devices upon embedding surfactant free Au nanoparticles (NPs) into the photoactive layer is investigated by in situ time-resolved energy dispersive X-ray reflectometry (EDXR), photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy as well as device degradation electrical measurements. It is shown that besides the improved cell efficiency attributed to plasmon absorption and scattering effects, the embedded NPs act as performance stabilizers, giving rise to enhanced structural stability and, in turn, to reduced photodegradation rate of the respective OPV devices. It is particularly clarified that, in addition to further stabilization of the polymer-fullerene blend, the observed improvement can be ascribed to a NP-mediated mitigation of the photooxidation effect at the cathode-active layer interface. Our work suggests the exploitation of surfactant free NPs to be a successful approach to address aging effects in OPV devices."
415,10.1021/acsami.8b07199,2018,Ternary Organic Photovoltaics Prepared by Sequential Deposition of Single Donor and Binary Acceptors.,"Binary organic photovoltaics (OPVs) fabricated by single-step (SS) deposition of a binary blend of polymer (or small molecule) donor and fullerene acceptor (SS binary OPV) are widely utilized. To improve the OPV performance, SS ternary OPVs utilizing a ternary blend consisting of two (or one) electron donor(s) and one (or two) electron acceptor(s) have been studied. SS ternary OPVs require more sensitive and complex optimization processes to optimize bulk heterojunctions with bicontinuous nanoscale phase separation of the donor and acceptor. We demonstrated a novel ternary OPV fabricated by sequential (SQ) deposition of a single polymer donor and a binary mixture consisting of a phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and nonfullerene acceptor, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3- d:2,3'- d']- s-indaceno[1,2- b:5,6- b']dithiophene (ITIC). In the SQ ternary OPV, PCBM effectively created a bicontinuous pathway for charge transport with a polymer, and ITIC mainly enhanced light absorption and photovoltage. This complementary effect was not observed in an SS ternary OPV utilizing the same donor and acceptors. Due to these complementary effects, the SQ ternary OPV exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 6.22%, which was 52 and 37% higher than that of the SQ binary OPV and the SS ternary OPV, respectively. In addition, the thermal stability of the SQ ternary OPV was found to be superior to that of the SS ternary OPV."
416,10.1371/journal.pbio.2002468,2017,Assessing the stability of polio eradication after the withdrawal of oral polio vaccine,"The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of childhood paralysis by a factor of ten thousand or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is somehow re-introduced after OPV cessation, will it be likely to cause outbreaks? If the virus is from OPV, will the risk of vaccine-derived outbreaks always remain low? To answer these questions, we built a multiscale mathematical model of infection and transmission with data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. The within-host model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and dose response. The transmission model captures how shedding and dose response interact with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the force of infection in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine alone is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low force of infection settings, and that OPV can be started and stopped safely in moderate force of infection settings. However, in high force of infection settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. With insufficient immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. We conclude that while eradication may still be achieved with continued use of Sabin OPV, a new vaccine is needed to secure eradication for all time. Author Summary Oral polio vaccine (OPV) has played an essential role in the elimination of wild poliovirus (WPV). OPV contains transmissible viruses that can spread from person-to-person. When OPV transmission persists uninterrupted, vaccine-derived outbreaks occur. After OPV is no longer used in routine immunization, as with the cessation of type 2 OPV in 2016, population immunity will decline. A key question is how this affects the potential of OPV viruses to spread within and across communities. To address this, we examined the roles of immunity, sanitation, and social contact in limiting OPV transmission. Our results derive from an extensive review and synthesis of vaccine trial data and community epidemiological studies. Shedding, dose response, and transmission data are analyzed to systematically explain and model observations of WPV and OPV circulation. We show that in high force of infection settings, falling population immunity after OPV cessation will lead to conditions where OPV and WPV are similarly capable of causing outbreaks, and that this conclusion is compatible with the known safety of OPV prior to global cessation.

Photoelectric conversion efficiency is crucial to the evaluation of quality in OPV devices, and enhancing efficiency has been spurring on researchers to seek alternatives to this problem. In this paper, we focus on organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices and review several approaches to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of small molecular heterojunction OPV devices based on an optimal metal-phthalocyanine/fullerene (C60) planar heterojunction thin film structure. For the sake of discussion, these mechanisms have been divided into electrical and optical sections: (1) Electrical: Modification on electrodes or active regions to benefit carrier injection, charge transport and exciton dissociation; (2) Optical: Optional architectures or infilling to promote photon confinement and enhance absorption."

The virus has the broadest host range of OPV and is transmitted to humans from rodents and other wild or domestic animals. Increasing numbers of human CPXV infections in a population with declining immunity have raised concerns about the virus’ zoonotic potential. While there have been reports on the proteome of other human-pathogenic OPV, namely vaccinia virus (VACV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV), the protein composition of the CPXV mature virion (MV) is unknown. This study focused on the comparative analysis of the VACV and CPXV MV proteome by label-free single-run proteomics using nano liquid chromatography and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). The presented data reveal that the common VACV and CPXV MV proteome contains most of the known conserved and essential OPV proteins and is associated with cellular proteins known to be essential for viral replication. While the species-specific proteome could be linked mainly to less genetically-conserved gene products, the strain-specific protein abundance was found to be of high variance in proteins associated with entry, host-virus interaction and protein processing."

During April-December 2013, a polio outbreak caused by WPV type 1 (WPV1) of Nigerian origin resulted in 217 cases in or near the Horn of Africa, including 194 cases in Somalia, 14 cases in Kenya, and nine cases in Ethiopia (all cases were reported as of March 10, 2014). During December 14-18, 2013, Kenya conducted the first-ever campaign providing inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) together with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) as part of its outbreak response. The campaign targeted 126,000 children aged ≤59 months who resided in Somali refugee camps and surrounding communities near the Kenya-Somalia border, where most WPV1 cases had been reported, with the aim of increasing population immunity levels to ensure interruption of any residual WPV transmission and prevent spread from potential new importations. A campaign evaluation and vaccination coverage survey demonstrated that combined administration of IPV and OPV in a mass campaign is feasible and can achieve coverage >90%, although combined IPV and OPV campaigns come at a higher cost than OPV-only campaigns and require particular attention to vaccinator training and supervision. Future operational studies could assess the impact on population immunity and the cost-effectiveness of combined IPV and OPV campaigns to accelerate interruption of poliovirus transmission during polio outbreaks and in certain areas in which WPV circulation is endemic."
422,10.1039/c3nr00611e,2013,Application of solvent modified PEDOT:PSS to graphene electrodes in organic solar cells.,"Graphene has been proposed as a promising transparent conducting electrode material in organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells to substitute the widely used indium tin oxide (ITO). Various studies have reported OPV devices with graphene electrodes showing comparable performances to ITO-based OPV cells. However, the fabrication reliability or device yield has not been widely discussed. In our investigation it was found that graphene-based OPVs tend to have much lower device yield than the ITO-based ones if similar fabrication processes are used. One possible reason could be due to the challenge faced in obtaining a uniform coating of PEDOT:PSS hole injection layer (HIL) on graphene. In fact, several attempts have been made to overcome this challenge. In this work, we report a facile method of solvent modification of PEDOT:PSS to achieve a homogeneous coating on graphene. A significant enhancement in the device yield was observed as compared to devices using normal aqueous solution based PEDOT:PSS; nevertheless, it was still only ∼50%. Further improvement was made by adding an additional electron blocking layer (EBL), molybdenum trioxide, after the coating of PEDOT:PSS. The observation in this work calls for further investigation to understand the role played by the HIL or EBL in graphene-based OPV devices."
423,10.1093/infdis/jir723,2012,"Safety and immunogenicity of inactivated poliovirus vaccine made from Sabin strains: a phase II, randomized, positive-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND
The production of Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) can reduce biosafety requirements in the posteradication/post-oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) era. We conducted a phase II, randomized, positive-controlled trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Sabin IPV.


METHODS
The test groups (A, B, and C) received 3 doses of high, middle, and low D antigen (D Ag) of Sabin IPV at ages 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. Infants in 2 control groups, group D and group E, received 3 doses of trivalent OPV and conventional IPV (cIPV), respectively, on the same schedule as that of groups A, B, and C. Serum samples were collected before and 30 days after the administration of the third dose.


RESULTS
In total, 500 infants were randomly assigned to 5 groups, and 449 infants completed the vaccine series. No serious adverse events were associated with vaccinations. After 3 doses, the seroconversion rates in groups A, B, C, D, and E were 100%, 97.8%, 96.6%, 100%, and 90.1%, respectively, for type 1 poliovirus; 97.7%, 95.7%, 78.7%, 100%, and 90.1%, respectively, for type 2; and 98.8%, 98.9%, 93.3%, 100%, and 97.8%, respectively, for type 3.


CONCLUSIONS
Sabin IPV has good safety characteristics. The seroconversion rates for type 1 poliovirus (most appropriate concentration, 15 D Ag units [DU]), type 2 (32 DU), and type 3 (45 DU) Sabin IPV were similar to those of the OPV and cIPV control groups.

To retrospectively analyze the computed tomographic (CT) findings in a single-center series of adult patients with biopsy-proved obliterative portal venopathy (OPV) and to compare them with those observed in patients with cirrhosis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The requirement for informed consent was waived. This institutional review board-approved study included 42 consecutive patients with a histologically proved diagnosis of OPV who underwent CT at diagnosis. The clinical characteristics at diagnosis were recorded, and CT examination results were reviewed. Two radiologists evaluated portal vein patency and intrahepatic portal branches, the morphologic changes in the liver, the presence of hepatic nodules, and signs of portal hypertension in consensus. The control group consisted of 42 patients who had histologically proved cirrhosis. CT findings were compared between the OPV patient group and the cirrhotic group and also among the conditions associated with patients with OPV. The Fisher exact test was used. P values of .05 or less were considered to indicate significant differences.


RESULTS
The following CT findings were observed significantly more frequently in OPV than in cirrhosis: extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (18 [43%] of 42 vs five [12%] of 42); intrahepatic portal abnormalities (18 [58%] of 31 vs one [2%] of 42) such as reduced caliber, occlusive thrombosis, and lack of visibility; focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules (six [14%] of 42 vs 0 [0%] of 42); and perfusion disorders (15 [36%] of 42 vs six [14%] of 42). Conversely, the combination of hypertrophy of the caudate lobe and atrophy of segment IV (27 [64%] of 42 vs 10 [24%] of 42) and nodular surface (37 [88%] of 42 vs seven [17%] of 42) were seen significantly more often in cirrhosis.


CONCLUSION
Characteristic CT findings in patients with OPV that differ from those in patients with cirrhosis were shown, the most common being the presence of intra- or extrahepatic portal abnormalities."
425,10.1093/infdis/jis241,2012,Waning intestinal immunity after vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccines in India.,"BACKGROUND
The eradication of wild-type polioviruses in areas with efficient fecal-oral transmission relies on intestinal mucosal immunity induced by oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Mucosal immunity is thought to wane over time but the rate of loss of protection has not been examined.


METHODS
We examined the degree and duration of intestinal mucosal immunity in India by measuring the prevalence of vaccine poliovirus in stool samples collected 4-28 days after a ""challenge"" dose of OPV among 47 574 children with acute flaccid paralysis reported during 2005-2009.


RESULTS
Previous vaccination with OPV was protective against excretion of vaccine poliovirus after challenge, but the odds of excretion increased significantly with the time since the child was last exposed to an immunization activity (odds ratio, 1.39 [95% confidence interval .99-1.97], 2.04 [1.28-3.25], and 1.31 [1.00-1.70] comparing ≥6 months with 1 month ago for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Vaccine administered during the high season for enterovirus infections (April-September) was significantly less likely to result in excretion, especially in northern states (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% confidence interval, .50-.65], 0.58 [.41-.81], and 0.48 [.40-.57] for serotypes 1, 2, and 3).


CONCLUSIONS
Infection with OPV (vaccine ""take"") is highly seasonal in India and results in intestinal mucosal immunity that appears to wane significantly within a year of vaccination."
426,10.1080/21645515.2015.1088617,2016,Polio elimination in Nigeria: A review,"abstract Nigeria has made tremendous strides towards eliminating polio and has been free of wild polio virus (WPV) for more than a year as of August 2015. However, sustained focus towards getting rid of all types of poliovirus by improving population immunity and enhancing disease surveillance will be needed to ensure it sustains the polio-free status. We reviewed the pertinent literature including published and unpublished, official reports and working documents of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners as well as other concerned organizations. The literature were selected based on the following criteria: published in English Language, published after year 2000, relevant content and conformance to the theme of the review and these were sorted accordingly. The challenges facing the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) in Nigeria were found to fall into 3 broad categories viz failure to vaccinate, failure of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and epidemiology of the virus. Failure to vaccinate resulted from insecurity, heterogeneous political support, programmatic limitation in implementation of vaccination campaigns, poor performance of vaccination teams in persistently poor performing Local Government areas and sporadic vaccine refusals in Northern Nigeria. Sub optimal effectiveness of OPV in some settings as well as the rare occurrence of VDPVs associated with OPV type 2 in areas of low immunization coverage were also found to be key issues. Some of the innovations which helped to manage the threats to the PEI include a strong government accountability frame work, change from type 2 containing OPV to bi valent OPVs for supplementary immunization activities (SIA), enhancing environmental surveillance in key states (Sokoto, Kano and Borno) along with an overall improvement in SIA quality. There has been an improvement in coverage of routine immunization and vaccination campaigns, which has resulted in Nigeria being removed from the list of endemic countries following an absence of new cases for an entire year as of September 2015. However, the last mile remains to be crossed and there is need to further improve and sustain the momentum to complete the journey toward polio elimination."
427,10.1001/JAMA.292.14.1696,2004,Vaccine policy changes and epidemiology of poliomyelitis in the United States.,"CONTEXT
The last case of poliomyelitis in the United States due to indigenously acquired wild poliovirus occurred in 1979; however, as a consequence of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use that began in 1961, an average of 9 cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) were confirmed each year from 1961 through 1989. To reduce the VAPP burden, national vaccination policy changed in 1997 from reliance on OPV to options for a sequential schedule of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) followed by OPV. In 2000, an exclusive IPV schedule was adopted.


OBJECTIVE
To review the epidemiology of paralytic poliomyelitis and document the association between the vaccine schedule changes and VAPP in the United States.


DESIGN AND SETTING
Review of national surveillance data from 1990 through 2003 for cases of confirmed paralytic poliomyelitis.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Number of confirmed paralytic poliomyelitis cases, including VAPP, and ratio of VAPP cases to number of doses of OPV distributed that occurred before, during, and after implementation of policy changes.


RESULTS
From 1990 through 1999, 61 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were reported; 59 (97%) of these were VAPP (1 case per 2.9 million OPV doses distributed), 1 case was imported, and 1 case was indeterminate. Thirteen cases occurred during the 1997-1999 transitional policy period and were associated with the all-OPV schedule; none occurred with the IPV-OPV schedule. No cases occurred after the United States implemented the all-IPV policy in 2000. The last imported poliomyelitis case occurred in 1993 and the last case of VAPP occurred in 1999.


CONCLUSION
The change in polio vaccination policy from OPV to exclusive use of IPV was successfully implemented; this change led to the elimination of VAPP in the United States."
428,10.1542/peds.2014-3163,2015,Eradicating Polio: How the World’s Pediatricians Can Help Stop This Crippling Illness Forever,"The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. This plan was endorsed in November 2012 by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization of the World Health Organization and published by the World Health Organization in April 2013. As a key component of the plan, it will be necessary to stop oral polio vaccine (OPV) use globally to achieve eradication, because the attenuated viruses in the vaccine rarely can cause polio. The plan includes procedures for elimination of vaccine-associated paralytic polio and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). cVDPVs can proliferate when vaccine viruses are transmitted among susceptible people, resulting in mutations conferring both the neurovirulence and transmissibility characteristics of wild polioviruses. Although there are 3 different types of wild poliovirus strains, the polio eradication effort has already resulted in the global elimination of type 2 poliovirus for more than a decade. Type 3 poliovirus may be eliminated because the wild type 3 poliovirus was last detected in 2012. Thus, of the 3 wild types, only wild type 1 poliovirus is still known to be circulating and causing disease. OPV remains the key vaccine for eradicating wild polioviruses in polio-infected countries because it induces high levels of systemic immunity to prevent paralysis and intestinal immunity to reduce transmission. However, OPV is a rare cause of paralysis and the substantial decrease in wild-type disease has resulted in estimates that the vaccine is causing more polio-related paralysis annually in recent years than the wild virus. The new endgame strategic plan calls for stepwise removal of the type 2 poliovirus component from trivalent oral vaccines, because type 2 wild poliovirus appears to have been eradicated (since 1999) and yet is the main cause of cVDPV outbreaks and approximately 40% of vaccine-associated paralytic polio cases. The Endgame and Strategic Plan will be accomplished by shifting from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (containing types 1 and 3 poliovirus only). It will be necessary to introduce trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) into routine immunization programs in all countries using OPV to provide population immunity to type 2 before the switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative hopes to achieve global eradication of polio by 2018 with this strategy, after which all OPV use will be stopped. Challenges expected for adding IPV into routine immunization schedules include higher cost of IPV compared with OPV, cold-chain capacity limits, more complex administration of vaccine because IPV requires injections as opposed to oral administration, and inferior intestinal immunity conferred by IPV. The goal of this report is to help pediatricians understand the change in strategy and outline ways that pediatricians can help global polio eradication efforts, including advocating for the resources needed to accomplish polio eradication and for incorporation of IPV into routine immunization programs in all countries."
429,10.1093/OXFORDJOURNALS.AJE.A009924,1999,Transmissibility and persistence of oral polio vaccine viruses: implications for the global poliomyelitis eradication initiative.,"The global poliomyelitis eradication initiative has been a tremendous success, with current evidence suggesting that wild poliovirus will cease to circulate anywhere in the world soon after the year 2000. As the goal of wild poliovirus eradication is approached, concern has been raised about the potential for persistent transmission of oral polio vaccine (OPV) viruses, as these viruses are known to revert toward wild-type neurovirulence. This paper has been extracted from a document prepared for the World Health Organization on the implications of OPV transmissibility for the strategy of stopping OPV vaccination after global eradication of wild polioviruses. The authors review the empirical evidence on OPV transmissibility available from household and community transmission studies and from mass-vaccination experiences. They then consider theoretical measures of transmissibility and persistence for wild and OPV viruses (secondary attack rate, basic reproduction number, and critical populations' size), to assess whether transmissibility of OPV viruses is sufficient to allow persistence of these viruses after cessation of vaccination. The findings indicate that OPV viruses could persist under various plausible circumstances, and that this potential should be a major consideration when planning the cessation of OPV vaccination."
430,10.1117/12.284148,1997,Tuning of fluorescence in films and nanoparticles of oligo-phenylenevinylenes,"Oligo-phenylenevinylenes (OPV) with a series of distance controlling, electron donating, and/or electron withdrawing substituents are deposited from vapor phase and solution as ultrathin films or nanoparticles with diameters of 20 - 200 nm. In some cases the systems are doped at levels of 10-5 - 10-3 with energy accepting OPV's of longer chainlengths. Absorption and fluorescence spectra, steady-state and time-resolved anisotropies, radiative and nonradiative deactivation rates of these systems are investigated and compared to the corresponding properties in dilute solutions. Fluorescence yields of the parent oligomers and their alkyl or oxyalkyl derivatives are high in solution with an `infinite' chain limit of (Phi) F approximately equals 0.5 and an upper radiative rate constant limit of kr(infinity ) equals (1 +/- 0.3) (DOT) 109 s-1. Yields and kr decrease strongly in films and nanoparticles because of H-aggregate formation. However, doping with fluorescent acceptors can increase the yields up to (Phi) F yields 0.7. Introduction of electron withdrawing -CN and -SO2CF3 substituents reduces (Phi) F in low viscous dilute solutions almost to zero. High viscosities and condensation to solid phases will rise the yields up to (Phi) F yields 0.6 because of suppression of nonradiative torsional deactivation and formation of J- aggregates with high kr."

Depositing a thin ZnO layer by ALD on wet-chemically prepared ZnO significantly increased the short-circuit current (Jsc) of the OPV. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.96% with Jsc of 17.9 mA/cm2 was observed in the inverted OPV with a 2-nm-thick ALD-ZnO layer, which quenched electron-hole recombination at surface defects of ZnO ripples. Moreover, an ALD-ZnO layer thinner than 2 nm made the distribution of electrical conductivity on the ZnO surface more uniform, enhancing OPV performance. In contrast, a thicker ALD-ZnO layer (5 nm) made the two-dimensional distribution of electrical conductivity on the ZnO surface more heterogeneous, reducing the PCE. In addition, depositing an ALD-ZnO thin layer enhanced OPV stability and initial performance. We suggest that the ALD-ZnO layer thickness should be precisely controlled to fabricate high-performing OPVs."

Here, charge transport and current fluctuations are investigated by performing correlated low‐frequency noise and impedance spectroscopy measurements on two BHJ OPV systems, one employing a fullerene acceptor and the other employing a dimeric PDI acceptor. In the dark, these measurements reveal that PDI‐based OPVs have a greater degree of recombination in comparison to fullerene‐based OPVs. Furthermore, for the first time in organic solar cells, 1/f noise data are fit to the Kleinpenning model to reveal underlying current fluctuations in different transport regimes. Under illumination, 1/f noise increases by approximately four orders of magnitude for the fullerene‐based OPVs and three orders of magnitude for the PDI‐based OPVs. An inverse correlation is also observed between noise spectral density and power conversion efficiency. Overall, these results show that low‐frequency noise spectroscopy is an effective in situ diagnostic tool to assess charge transport in emerging photovoltaic materials, thereby providing quantitative guidance for the design of next‐generation solar cell materials and technologies."

435,10.1039/C0JM03048A,2011,Inverted organic photovoltaic devices with high efficiency and stability based on metal oxide charge extraction layers,"A substantial increase in device performance and operational stability in solution processed inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) is demonstrated by introducing a zinc oxide (ZnO) interlayer between the electron collecting bottom electrode and the photoactive blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The structure and morphology of the dense, planar ZnO layers were controlled either by electro-deposition or spray pyrolysis techniques. Metal oxide sandwich OPV devices based on the photoactive blend on an electro-deposited ZnO interlayer with a (100) preferential crystal orientation, and using a tungsten oxide (WOx) interlayer on the opposite electrode, resulted in a remarkable increase in power conversion efficiency with a value of 4.91% under AM1.5 illumination and an external quantum efficiency of 74%. Electro-deposition of the ZnO at low temperature proved to be the most promising method for forming the ZnO interlayers, allowing the highest control of film structure and morphology, as well as leading to significantly improved device efficiency and stability."

Improved cohesion is important for OPV device thermomechanical reliability. BHJ devices are investigated and how fullerene intercalation within the active layer affects cohesive properties in the BHJ is shown. The intercalation of fullerenes between the side chains of the polymers poly(3,3″′‐didocecyl quaterthiophene) (PQT‐12) and poly(2,5‐bis(3‐hexadecylthiophen‐2‐yl)thieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (pBTTT) is shown to enhance BHJ layer cohesion. Cohesion values range from ≈1 to 5 J m−2, depending on the polymer:fullerene blend, processing conditions, and composition. Devices with non‐intercalated BHJ layers are found to have significantly reduced values of cohesion. The resulting device power conversion efficiencies (PCE) are also investigated and correlated with the device cohesion."
437,10.1021/JP3125186,2013,Electrostatic Effects at Organic Semiconductor Interfaces: A Mechanism for “Cold” Exciton Breakup,"Exciton dissociation at organic semiconductor interfaces is an important process for the design of future organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, but at present, it is poorly understood. On the one hand, exciton breakup is very efficient in many OPVs. On the other, electron–hole pairs generated by an exciton should be bound by Coulombic attraction, and therefore difficult to separate in materials of such low dielectric. In this paper, we highlight several electrostatic effects that appear commonly at organic/organic interfaces. Using QM/MM simulations, we demonstrate that the electric fields generated in this fashion are large enough to overcome typical electron–hole binding energies and thus explain the high efficiencies of existing OPV devices without appealing to the existence of nonthermal (“hot”) carrier distributions. Our results suggest that the classical picture of flat bands at organic/organic interfaces is only qualitatively correct. A more accurate picture takes into account the subtle effects of e..."

This new OPV compound is highly prone to formsingle crystals. X-ray analysis indicates that it exhibits a rigidplanar structure with extended p-conjugated length, whichleads to strong solid-state fluorescence induced by absorptionof one or two photons. Furthermore, a sharp stimulatedemission band is observed to emerge at high excitationintensity in the emission spectrum of TOPV single crystals.The strong two-photon excited fluorescence and stimulatedemission are extremely attractive for numerous applicationssuch as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), nonlinear optics,photoconductors, photovoltaics, and upconversion lasing(UCL)."

When compared to the corresponding OPV π-gelator terminated by a phenyl-amide (OPV-Ph), the aggregation properties of OPV-Py were found to be significantly different, leading to multistimuli gelation and other morphological properties. The pyridyl moiety in OPV-Py initially interferes with the amide H-bonded assembly and gelation, however, protonation of the pyridyl moiety with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) facilitated the formation of amide H-bonded assembly leading to gelation, which is reversible by the addition of N,N-diisopropyethylamine (DiPEA). Interestingly, addition of Ag(+) ions to a solution of OPV-Py facilitated the formation of a metallo-supramolecular assembly leading to gelation. Surprisingly, ultrasound-induced gelation was observed when OPV-Py was mixed with a dicarboxylic acid (A1). A detailed study using different spectroscopic and microscopic experimental techniques revealed the difference in the mode of assembly in the two molecules and the multistimuli-responsive nature of the OPV-Py gelation."

The experimental and theoretical studies of the Si-OPVs 1-4 demonstrate the fully extended π-conjugation of the Si-OPV main chains. Single crystal X-ray analyses of the monomer 1 and the dimer 2 revealed the highly coplanar Si-OPV backbones facilitating the effective extension of the π-conjugation, which has further been validated by the significant increases in the absorption maxima from 465 nm for the monomer 1 to 610 nm for the tetramer 4. The absorption maxima exhibit an excellent fit to Meier's equation, leading to the estimation of an effective conjugation length (ECL) of 9 repeat units (nECL = 9) and the absorption maximum of 635 nm for the infinite chain (λ∞ = 635 nm). In sharp contrast to other nonemissive disilenes, the Si-OPVs 2-4 show an intense fluorescence from 613 to 668 nm at room temperature with the quantum yields up to 0.48. All the data presented here provide the first evidence for the efficient extended π-conjugation between the Si═Si double bonds and the carbon π-electron systems over the entire Si-OPV skeleton. This study reveals the possibility for developing the conjugated disilene π-systems, in which the Si═Si double bonds would be promising building blocks, significantly optimizing the intrinsic photophysical and electrochemical properties of the carbon-based π-conjugated materials."
441,10.1364/AO.54.010232,2015,Visibly transparent organic photovoltaic with improved transparency and absorption based on tandem photonic crystal for greenhouse application.,"We demonstrate a visible transparent organic photovoltaic (OPV) with improved transmission and absorption based on tandem photonic crystals (TPCs) for greenhouse applications. The proposed device has an average transmittance of 40.3% in the visible range of 400-700 nm and a high quality transparency spectrum for plant growth with a crop growth factor of 41.9%, considering the weight of the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. Compared with the corresponding transparent OPV without photonic crystals, an enhancement of 20.7% in the average transmittance and of 24.5% in the crop growth factor are achieved. Detailed investigations reveal that the improved transmittance is attributed to the excitation of the optical Tamm state and the light interference effect in TPC. Concomitantly, the total absorption efficiency in the active layer of the designed TPC based transparent OPV reaches 51.5%, being 1.78% higher than that of the transparent OPV without PC and 76% of that of the opaque counterpart. The improved absorption originates from the Bragg forbidden reflectance of TPC. Overall, our proposal achieves the optimized utilization of sunlight by light manipulation of TPC."
442,10.1093/infdis/jit834,2014,Modeling strategies to increase population immunity and prevent poliovirus transmission in the high-risk area of northwest Nigeria.,"BACKGROUND
Nigeria continues to struggle in its efforts to eliminate circulating live polioviruses using oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV).


METHODS
We modeled population immunity, and we estimated cases and the timing of transmission die-out for numerous policies that could accelerate the elimination of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and help Nigeria manage the risks of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). We used a differential-equation based poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model focused on northwest Nigeria to characterize the impact and trade-offs of potential vaccination strategies, including the introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).


RESULTS
Northwest Nigeria appears close to reaching the threshold of population immunity it must exceed to stop WPV1 transmission if it continues immunizing previously under-vaccinated children. Avoiding type 2 cVDPVs (cVDPV2s) will depend on using sufficient amounts of trivalent OPV, which will also reduce the risks of cVDPV2s after coordinated cessation of type 2-containing OPV (OPV2). Using IPV during the OPV cessation period may increase population immunity, but it leads to a much lower impact on cVDPV risks than ensuring sufficient trivalent OPV use prior to OPV2 cessation.


CONCLUSIONS
Northwest Nigeria needs to intensify and sustain its immunization efforts to achieve and maintain higher levels of population immunity."
443,10.1166/JNN.2014.9017,2014,Surface plasmonic effects on organic solar cells.,"Most high-performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices reported in the literature have been fabricated using the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept. Typically, the optimum thickness of the active layer for an OPV device is around 100 nm, or possibly less; such a thin layer can lead to low absorption of light. A thicker layer, however, inevitably increases the device resistance, due to the low carrier mobilities and short exciton diffusion lengths in organic materials. This situation imposes a trade-off between light absorption and charge transport efficiencies in OPV devices, motivating the development of a variety of light-trapping techniques. Metallic nanoparticles (NPs) such as Ag, Au, etc. and other metallic nanostructures are potential candidates for improving the light absorption due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). LSPR contributes to the significant enhancement of local electromagnetic fields and improves the optical properties of the nanostructure devices. The excitation of LSPR is achieved when the frequency of the incident light matches its resonance peak, resulting in unique optical properties; selective light extinction as well as local enhancement of electromagnetic fields near the surface of metallic NPs. The resonance peak of LSPR depends strongly on the size, shape, and the dielectric environment of the metallic NPs. In this review article, progress on plasmonic enhanced OPV device performance is examined. The concepts of surface plasmonics for OPV devices, suitable plasmonic materials, location, optimum size and concentration of NP materials within the device are explored."
444,10.1021/nn1022457,2011,Fluorescence and electroluminescence quenching evidence of interfacial charge transfer in poly (3-hexylthiophene): graphene oxide bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices.,"We present electrochemical studies of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and demonstrate the fluorescence and electrogenerated chemiluminescence quenching capability of GO nanosheets that are transferred into chloroform from aqueous solution utilizing a novel, surfactant-assisted method. Electrochemical studies indicate that GO can be reduced upon charge injection. Fluorescence quenching of the conjugate polymer poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in both solution and solid films is demonstrated to show that GO can be used as an electron acceptor in a bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) device. OPV devices were then fabricated with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT-GO/Al structure. Devices containing GO exhibited an increase in short-circuit current (I(sc)) and conductivity but a decrease in open circuit potential (V(oc)). These results display the potential for nonorganically functionalized GO to be used as an acceptor material in future OPV devices. The results also indicate that GO can increase the conductivity of the nanocomposite film so that charge recombination is an issue in such a device. The increased conductivity and fluorescence quenching are also supported by electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of P3HT/GO composite films."
445,10.1002/adfm.201000224,2010,Influence of Molecular Weight on the Performance of Organic Solar Cells Based on a Fluorene Derivative,"The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) bulk‐heterojunction blends comprising a liquid‐crystalline fluorene derivative and a small‐molecular fullerene is found to increase asymptotically with the degree of polymerization of the former. Similar to various thermodynamic transition temperatures as well as the light absorbance of the fluorene moiety, the photocurrent extracted from OPV devices is found to strongly vary with increasing oligomer size up to a number average molecular weight, Mn ≈ 10 kg mol−1, but is rendered less chain‐length dependent for higher Mn as the fluorene derivative gradually adopts polymeric behavior."
446,10.1039/C4TA03469D,2014,Use of a commercially available nucleating agent to control the morphological development of solution-processed small molecule bulk heterojunction organic solar cells,"The nucleating agent DMDBS is used to modulate the crystallization of solution-processed small molecule donor molecules in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ OPV) devices. This control over donor molecule crystallization leads to a reduction in optimized thermal annealing times as well as smaller donor molecule crystallites, and therefore more efficient devices, when using an excessive amount of solvent additive. We therefore demonstrate the use of nucleating agents as a powerful and versatile processing strategy for solution-processed, small molecule BHJ OPVs."
447,10.1021/ja508453n,2014,"""Supersaturated"" self-assembled charge-selective interfacial layers for organic solar cells.","To achieve densely packed charge-selective organosilane-based interfacial layers (IFLs) on the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) anodes of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, a series of Ar2N-(CH2)n-SiCl3 precursors with Ar = 3,4-difluorophenyl, n = 3, 6, 10, and 18, was synthesized, characterized, and chemisorbed on OPV anodes to serve as IFLs. To minimize lateral nonbonded -NAr2···Ar2N- repulsions which likely limit IFL packing densities in the resulting self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), precursor mixtures having both small and large n values are simultaneously deposited. These ""heterogeneous"" SAMs are characterized by a battery of techniques: contact angle measurements, X-ray reflectivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), cyclic voltammetry, and DFT computation. It is found that the headgroup densities of these ""supersaturated"" heterogeneous SAMs (SHSAMs) are enhanced by as much as 17% versus their homogeneous counterparts. Supersaturation significantly modifies the IFL properties including the work function (as much as 16%) and areal dipole moment (as much as 49%). Bulk-heterojunction OPV devices are fabricated with these SHSAMs: ITO/IFL/poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl][2-[[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]carbonyl]-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]:phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM)/LiF/Al. OPVs having SHSAM IFLs exhibit significantly enhanced performance (PCE by 54%; Voc by 35%) due to enhanced charge selectivity and collection, with the PCE rivaling or exceeding that of PEDOT:PSS IFL devices -7.62%. The mechanism underlying the enhanced performance involves modified hole collection and selectivity efficiency inferred from the UPS data. The ITO/SAM/SHSAM surface potential imposed by the dipolar SAMs causes band bending and favorably alters the Schottky barrier height. Thus, interfacial charge selectivity and collection are enhanced as evident in the greater OPV Voc."
448,,2014,"Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses — Worldwide, July 2012–December 2013","In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate poliomyelitis worldwide. One of the main tools used in polio eradication efforts has been live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), an inexpensive vaccine easily administered by trained volunteers. OPV might require several doses to induce immunity, but then it provides long-term protection against paralytic disease through durable humoral immunity. Rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis can occur among immunologically normal OPV recipients, their contacts, and persons who are immunodeficient. In addition, vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) can emerge in areas with low OPV coverage to cause polio outbreaks and can replicate for years in persons who have primary, B-cell immunodeficiencies. This report updates previous surveillance summaries and describes VDPVs detected worldwide during July 2012-December 2013. Those include a new circulating VDPV (cVDPV) outbreak identified in Pakistan in 2012, with spread to Afghanistan; an outbreak in Afghanistan previously identified in 2009 that continued into 2013; a new outbreak in Chad that spread to Cameroon, Niger, and northeastern Nigeria; and an outbreak that began in Somalia in 2008 that continued and spread to Kenya in 2013. A large outbreak in Nigeria that was identified in 2005 was nearly stopped by the end of 2013. Additionally, 10 newly identified persons in eight countries were found to excrete immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs), and VDPVs were found among immunocompetent persons and environmental samples in 13 countries. Because the majority of VDPV isolates are type 2, the World Health Organization has developed a plan for coordinated worldwide replacement of trivalent OPV (tOPV) with bivalent OPV (bOPV; types 1 and 3) by 2016, preceded by introduction of at least 1 dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) containing all three poliovirus serotypes into routine immunization schedules worldwide to ensure high population immunity to all polioviruses."
449,10.1039/C2EE22098A,2012,Understanding the effect of ferroelectric polarization on power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices,"It is demonstrated that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaic devices can be increased by inserting an ultrathin film of a ferroelectric co-polymer, poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), at the metal–organic interface, due to an enhancement of the charge extraction efficiency. Specifically, the effect of P(VDF-TrFE) crystallinity on its function in ferroelectric organic photovoltaic (FE-OPV) devices has been studied by several methods. Highly crystalline and amorphous P(VDF-TrFE) films have been prepared by the Langmuir–Blodgett method and spin-coating from acetone solution, respectively. The polymer solar cell devices with a crystalline P(VDF-TrFE) interfacial layer at the cathode have larger PCE than the structures with amorphous P(VDF-TrFE) and have the unique feature of switchable diode polarity and photovoltaic performance controlled by external applied voltage pulses. The obtained results confirm that the spontaneous polarization of the ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) layer is responsible for the enhancement of PCE in FE-OPV devices and that a highly crystalline ferroelectric polymer film is required to observe the enhancement of PCE. Amorphous P(VDF-TrFE) films act as regular dielectric layers with a little poling effect on device PCE. The polarization of P(VDF-TrFE) is shown to be stable, and the photogenerated charges could be collected efficiently by the cathode rather than being compensated."
450,10.1586/erv.12.28,2012,Risks associated with the use of live-attenuated vaccine poliovirus strains and the strategies for control and eradication of paralytic poliomyelitis,"The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988 with the aim to eliminate paralytic poliomyelitis. Two effective vaccines are available: inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). Since 1964, OPV has been used instead of IPV in most countries due to several economic and biological advantages. However, in rare cases, the live-attenuated Sabin strains of OPV revert to neurovirulence and cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in vaccinees or lead to emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus strains. Attenuating mutations and recombination events have been associated with the reversion of vaccine strains to neurovirulence. The substitution of OPV with an improved new-generation IPV and the availability of new specific drugs against polioviruses are considered as future strategies for outbreak control and the eradication of paralytic poliomyelitis worldwide."

The presence of moisture and oxygen in conjugated polymer matrix is the major factors responsible for the degradation of organic molecules. The chemical degradation of OPV cell generally depends on the nature of the semiconductor polymer used in the preparation of the devices. However, the lifespan of unprotected OPV cells often ranges in the order of few hours in simple laboratory environment. We are reporting here the lifetime of organic photovoltaic cell in ambient laboratory condition whose active layer is composed of PTB7:PCBM blend."

This study reports the utilization of THC8, a novel fluorescence-based polymer containing propeller-shaped di-triarylamine and fluorene moieties in the active layer consisting of poly-3-hexylthiophene and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester to form a ternary bulk heterojunction. The results showed that the high absorbance and strong fluorescence of THC8 at 420 and 510 nm, respectively, broadened the spectral absorption of the OPV, possibly through Förster resonance energy transfer. In addition, the morphology of the device active layer was improved with the addition of a suitable amount of THC8. Consequently, the charge transport property of the active layer was improved. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device with THC8 was 3.88%, a 25% increase compared to the PCE of a pristine OPV."
453,10.1002/aenm.201100674,2012,Nanofiber‐Based Bulk‐Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Using Coaxial Electrospinning,"Nanofibers consisting of the bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ–OPV) electron donor–electron acceptor pair poly(3‐hexylthiophene):phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) are produced through a coaxial electrospinning process. While P3HT:PCBM blends are not directly electrospinnable, P3HT:PCBM‐containing fibers are produced in a coaxial fashion by utilizing polycaprolactone (PCL) as an electrospinnable sheath material. Pure P3HT:PCBM fibers are easily obtained after electrospinning by selectively removing the PCL sheath with cyclopentanone (average diameter 120 ± 30 nm). These fibers are then incorporated into the active layer of a BHJ–OPV device, which results in improved short‐circuit current densities, fill factors, and power‐conversion efficiencies (PCE) as compared to thin‐film devices of identical chemical composition. The best‐performing fiber‐based devices exhibit a PCE of 4.0%, while the best thin‐film devices have a PCE of 3.2%. This increase in device performance is attributed to the increased in‐plane alignment of P3HT polymer chains on the nanoscale, caused by the electrospun fibers, which leads to increased optical absorption and subsequent exciton generation. This methodology for improving device performance of BHJ–OPVs could also be implemented for other electron donor–electron acceptor systems, as nanofiber formation is largely independent of the PV material."
454,10.1099/vir.0.036988-0,2012,The polio-eradication programme and issues of the end game.,"Poliovirus causes paralytic poliomyelitis, an ancient disease of humans that became a major public-health issue in the 20th century. The primary site of infection is the gut, where virus replication is entirely harmless; the two very effective vaccines developed in the 1950s (oral polio vaccine, or OPV, and inactivated polio vaccine, or IPV) induce humoral immunity, which prevents viraemic spread and disease. The success of vaccination in middle-income and developing countries encouraged the World Health Organization to commit itself to an eradication programme, which has made great advances. The features of the infection, including its largely silent nature and the ability of the live vaccine (OPV) to evolve and change in vaccine recipients and their contacts, make eradication particularly challenging. Understanding the pathogenesis and virology of the infection is of major significance as the programme reaches its conclusion."
455,10.1063/1.4737902,2012,"Efficient, bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells based on boron subphthalocyanine chloride-C70","In this work, we describe the performance of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on the electron donor-acceptor pairing of boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and C70. As an acceptor, C70 is a promising alternative to C60 due to its red-shifted absorption edge and large extinction coefficient, permitting increased photocurrent generation. In uniformly mixed OPVs based on SubPc:C70, peak power conversion efficiency is realized in devices containing 80 wt. % C70. Further enhancement in device performance can be realized through the use of a continuously graded donor-acceptor heterojunction. The optimized graded heterojunction OPV shows a power conversion efficiency of ηP = (5.4 ± 0.2)% under simulated AM1.5 G solar illumination at 100 mW/cm2. This efficiency is significantly larger than the value of ηP = (4.5 ± 0.1)% realized using C60 due to a substantial increase in the short-circuit current density."
456,10.1039/C1JM11239B,2011,Phase behaviour of liquid-crystalline polymer/fullerene organic photovoltaic blends: thermal stability and miscibility,"The thermal behaviour of an organic photovoltaic (OPV) binary system comprised of a liquidcrystalline fluorene-based polymer and a fullerene derivative is investigated. We employ variabletemperature ellipsometry complemented by photo- and electroluminescence spectroscopy as well as optical microscopy and scanning force nanoscopy to explore phase transitions of blend thin films. The high glass transition temperature correlates with the good thermal stability of solar cells based on these materials. Furthermore, we observe partial miscibility of the donor and acceptor together with the tendency of excess fullerene derivative to segregate into exceedingly large domains. Thus, for charge generation less adequate bulk-heterojunction nanostructures are poised to develop if this mixture is exposed to more elevated temperatures. Gratifyingly, the solubility of the fullerene derivative in the polymer phase is found to decrease if a higher molecular-weight polymer fraction is employed, which offers routes towards improving the photovoltaic performance of non-crystalline OPV blends."
457,10.1590/S0042-96862004000100006,2004,Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses: current state of knowledge.,"Within the past 4 years, poliomyelitis outbreaks associated with circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) have occurred in Hispaniola (2000-01), the Philippines (2001), and Madagascar (2001-02). Retrospective studies have also detected the circulation of endemic cVDPV in Egypt (1988-93) and the likely localized spread of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)-derived virus in Belarus (1965-66). Gaps in OPV coverage and the previous eradication of the corresponding serotype of indigenous wild poliovirus were the critical risk factors for all cVDPV outbreaks. The cVDPV outbreaks were stopped by mass immunization campaigns using OPV. To increase sensitivity for detecting vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), in 2001 the Global Polio Laboratory Network implemented additional testing requirements for all poliovirus isolates under investigation. This approach quickly led to the recognition of the Philippines and Madagascar cVDPV outbreaks, but of no other current outbreaks. The potential risk of cVDPV emergence has increased dramatically in recent years as wild poliovirus circulation has ceased in most of the world. The risk appears highest for the type 2 OPV strain because of its greater tendency to spread to contacts. The emergence of cVDPVs underscores the critical importance of eliminating the last pockets of wild poliovirus circulation, maintaining universally high levels of polio vaccine coverage, stopping OPV use as soon as it is safely possible to do so, and continuing sensitive poliovirus surveillance into the foreseeable future. Particular attention must be given to areas where the risks for wild poliovirus circulation have been highest, and where the highest rates of polio vaccine coverage must be maintained to suppress cVDPV emergence."

Efforts to develop new therapeutics and vaccines for smallpox continue through their evaluation in animal models despite limited understanding of the specific correlates of protective immunity. Recent monkeypox virus challenge studies have established the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) as a model of human systemic OPV infections. In this study, we assess the induction of humoral immunity in humans and prairie dogs receiving Dryvax, Acam2000, or Imvamune vaccine and characterize the proteomic profile of immune recognition using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), neutralization assays, and protein microarrays. We confirm anticipated similarities of antigenic protein targets of smallpox vaccine-induced responses in humans and prairie dogs and identify several differences. Subsequent monkeypox virus intranasal infection of vaccinated prairie dogs resulted in a significant boost in humoral immunity characterized by a shift in reactivity of increased intensity to a broader range of OPV proteins. This work provides evidence of similarities between the vaccine responses in prairie dogs and humans that enhance the value of the prairie dog model system as an OPV vaccination model and offers novel findings that form a framework for examining the humoral immune response induced by systemic orthopoxvirus infection."
459,10.1155/2010/123534,2010,Organic Solar Cells: Problems and Perspectives,"For photovoltaic cells to convert solar into electric energy is probably the most interesting research challenge nowadays. A good efficiency of these devices has been obtained by using inorganic semiconductor materials. On the other hand, manufacture processes are very expensive in terms of both materials and techniques. For this reason organic-based photovoltaic (OPV) cells are attracting the general attention because of the possible realization of more economical devices. Organic materials are abundant and easily handling. Unfortunately OPV cells efficiency is significantly lower than that of inorganic-based devices, representing a big point of weakness at the present. This is mainly due to the fact that organic semiconductors have a much higher band gap with respect to inorganic semiconductors. In addition, OPV cells are very susceptible to oxygen and water. In this paper we will describe some of the different approaches to the understanding and improving of organic photovoltaic devices."
460,10.1021/JA0033180,2001,Hierarchical Order in Supramolecular Assemblies of Hydrogen-Bonded Oligo(p-phenylene vinylene)s,"Mono- and bifunctional oligo(p-phenylene vinylene)s (OPVs) functionalized with ureido-s-triazine units have been synthesized and fully characterized. In chloroform monofunctional OPV derivatives dimerize with a dimerization constant of Kdim = (2.1 ± 0.3) × 104 L/mol, while bifunctional OPV derivatives are present as random coil polymers in this solvent. In more apolar solvents such as dodecane, the hydrogen-bonded dimers of the monofunctional OPV derivative aggregate in chiral stacks, as can be concluded from UV/vis, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. Temperature-dependent measurements show a first-order transition at 53 ± 3 °C from the aggregated state to the molecularly dissolved phase. The bifunctional derivative also aggregates in dodecane; however, based on CD measurements, these aggregates are less organized. This behavior is presumably the outcome of a competition between favorable π−π interactions and restricted conformational freedom, due to the hexyl spacer, which results in a frustrated supramol..."
461,,2008,"Progress toward interruption of wild poliovirus transmission--worldwide, January 2007-April 2008.","In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate poliomyelitis. Subsequently, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative reduced the global incidence of polio associated with wild polioviruses (WPVs) from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to 1,997 reported cases in 2006 and reduced the number of countries that have never succeeded in interrupting WPV transmission from 125 to four (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan). Type 2 WPV (WPV2) circulation was last observed in October 1999. In February 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a stakeholders meeting to agree on an accelerated polio-eradication effort to be used during 2007-2008 and establish milestones to monitor progress. Programmatic strategies implemented in 2007 included expanded use of type 1 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) (mOPV1) to eliminate type 1 WPV (WPV1) transmission before type 3 WPV (WPV3) and targeted use of type 3 monovalent OPV (mOPV3) in selected areas. This report summarizes these strategies and overall progress toward reaching the milestones, including a decline in the overall number of WPV cases to 1,310 in 2007 and substantial progress toward interruption of WPV1 circulation in India in 2008."

In this paper, indium tin oxide (ITO) and hybrid ITO/SiO2 nanopillars are employed as three-dimensional high surface area transparent electrodes in OPVs. The nanopillar arrays are fabricated via glancing angle deposition (GLAD) and electrochemically modified with nanofibrous PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(p-styrenesulfonate)). The structures are found to have increased surface area as characterized by porosimetry. When applied as anodes in polymer/fullerene OPVs (architecture: commercial ITO/GLAD ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al, where P3HT is 2,5-diyl-poly(3-hexylthiophene) and PCBM is [6,6]-phenyl–C61-butyric acid methyl ester), the air-processed solar cells incorporating high surface area, PEDOT:PSS-modified ITO nanoelectrode arrays operate with improved performance relative to devices processed identically on unstructured, commercial ITO substrates. The resulting power conversion efficiency is 2.2% which is a third greater than for devices prepared on commercial ITO. To further refine the structure, insulating SiO2 caps are added above the GLAD ITO nanopillars to produce a hybrid ITO/SiO2 nanoelectrode. OPV devices based on this system show reduced electrical shorting and series resistance, and as a consequence, a further improved power conversion efficiency of 2.5% is recorded."
463,10.1063/1.3567930,2011,Origin of size effect on efficiency of organic photovoltaics,"It is widely accepted that efficiency of organic solar cells could be limited by their size. However, the published data on this effect are very limited and none of them includes analysis of light intensity dependence of the key cell parameters. We report such analysis for bulk heterojunction solar cells of various sizes and suggest that the origin of both the size and the light intensity effects should include underlying physical mechanisms other than conventional series resistance dissipation. In particular, we conclude that the distributed nature of the ITO resistance and its influence on the voltage dependence of photocurrent and dark current is the key to understanding size limitation of the organic photovoltaics (OPV) efficiency. Practical methods to overcome this limitation as well as the possibility of producing concentrator OPV cells operating under sunlight concentrations higher than 10 suns are discussed."

Because many of the cases were geographically and temporally clustered and because the case isolates differed antigenically from the vaccine strain, it was initially assumed that the cases signaled the continued circulation of wild type 2 poliovirus. However, comparison of sequences encoding the major capsid protein, VP1 (903 nucleotides), revealed that the isolates were related (93 to 97% nucleotide sequence identity) to the Sabin type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) strain and unrelated (<82% nucleotide sequence identity) to the wild type 2 polioviruses previously indigenous to Egypt (last known isolate: 1979) or to any contemporary wild type 2 polioviruses found elsewhere. The rate and pattern of VP1 divergence among the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) isolates suggested that all lineages were derived from a single OPV infection that occurred around 1983 and that progeny from the initiating infection circulated for approximately a decade within Egypt along several independent chains of transmission. Complete genomic sequences of an early (1988) and a late (1993) cVDPV isolate revealed that their 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) and noncapsid- 3′ UTR sequences were derived from other species C enteroviruses. Circulation of type 2 cVDPVs occurred at a time of low OPV coverage in the affected communities and ceased when OPV coverage rates increased. The potential for cVDPVs to circulate in populations with low immunity to poliovirus has important implications for current and future strategies to eradicate polio worldwide."

466,10.1093/infdis/jix105,2017,Considerations for the Full Global Withdrawal of Oral Polio Vaccine After Eradication of Polio,"Abstract Eliminating the risk of polio from vaccine-derived polioviruses is essential for creating a polio-free world, and eliminating that risk will require stopping use of all oral polio vaccines (OPVs) once all types of wild polioviruses have been eradicated. In many ways, the experience with the global switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) can inform the eventual full global withdrawal of OPV. Significant preparation will be needed for a thorough, synchronized, and full withdrawal of OPV, and such preparation would be aided by setting a reasonably firm date for OPV withdrawal as far in advance as possible, ideally at least 24 months. A shorter lead time would provide valuable flexibility for decisions about when to stop use of OPV in the context of uncertainty about whether or not all types of wild polioviruses had been eradicated, but it might increase the cost of OPV withdrawal."
467,10.1063/1.3243986,2009,Practical efficiency limits in organic photovoltaic cells: Functional dependence of fill factor and external quantum efficiency,"We evaluate practical power conversion efficiency limits (ηlim) in bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ OPV) cells and how the field dependence of exciton dissociation affects cell efficiencies. We treat the fill factor limit as a function of the donor-acceptor lowest unoccupied molecular orbital offset energy (ELLO), calculating how this limit varies with decreasing ELLO. We also evaluate OPV external quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength from the optical transmittance and internal quantum efficiency limitations. For a given ELLO, we numerically optimize donor bandgap and ηlim and show that ηlim>10% should be possible for hypothetical OPV systems generating free charge carriers efficiently at ELLO∼0.3–0.4 eV. Current BHJ OPVs with low ELLO values appear to be limited to cell efficiencies of ∼5% largely as a consequence of incomplete exciton dissociation."

Methods: Double-blind, randomized (2:1), placebo-controlled study conducted across 6 Latin American countries. Healthy infants (N = 6568) 6 to 12 weeks of age received 2 doses of RIX4414 vaccine or placebo following a 0, 1- to 2-month schedule. Routine vaccines including OPV were coadministered according to local EPI schedule. Vaccine efficacy (VE) against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by circulating wild-type rotavirus from 2 weeks post-Dose 2 until 1 year of age was calculated with 95% confidence interval [CI]. Safety was assessed during the entire study period. Immunogenicity of RIX4414 and OPV was also assessed. Results: During the efficacy follow-up period (mean duration = 7.4 months), 7 and 19 cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis were reported in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, with a VE of 81.6% (95% CI: 54.4–93.5). VE against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1 type was 100% (95% CI: <0–100) and 80.6% (95% CI: 51.4–93.2) against the pooled non-G1 rotavirus types, respectively. There was no difference (P = 0.514) in the incidence of serious adverse events reported in the 2 groups. Antirotavirus IgA seropositivity rate at 1 to 2 months post-Dose 2 was 61.4% (95% CI: 53.7–68.6) in the RIX4414 group; similar seroprotection rates (≥96.0%) against the 3 antipoliovirus types was observed 1 month post-Dose 3 of OPV in both groups. Conclusion: RIX4414 was highly efficacious against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by the circulating wild-type rotavirus (G1 and non-G1) when coadministered with routine EPI vaccines including OPV."

EM was found to be more efficient in OPV gelators with small end functional groups (OPV3-4) when compared to that of the gelators with bulky end groups (OPV1-2) in the gel state. TRES studies at elevated temperature and in chloroform solution highlight the role of the self-assembled scaffolds in assisting the EM and ET processes. Increase in temperature and solvent polarity leads to the aggregate breaking and hence adversely affects the EM and ET efficiencies. The effect of EM efficiency on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) properties of the OPV gels was studied by using OPV1 and OPV3 as the donors and OPV5 as the acceptor. Better transfer of excitation energy was observed in the donor system (OPV3) having higher EM efficiency even at very low concentration (3.1 mol%) of the acceptor molecules, whereas ET efficiency was lower in the donor system (OPV1) with low EM efficiency."

Optimized inverted OPV fabricated with these highly ordered periodic structures provided effective light trapping, which resulted in increased incident light absorption in the active layer. Consequently, OPVs with the ZnO PC layers show a 23% current density improvement compared with OPVs with planar ZnO layer. Finite-difference time-domain simulation studies show that the electric field intensity is significantly higher in the active layer for devices with ZnO PC structures in comparison with reference devices with planar ZnO electron selective layer. Nanoimprinted ZnO PC is, thus, a viable method for light absorption and efficiency enhancement in OPVs."
471,10.1002/aenm.201401442,2015,Low Substrate Temperature Encapsulation for Flexible Electrodes and Organic Photovoltaics,"Encapsulation is of key importance to improve the stability and lifetime of organic conductors and devices, mainly in applications such as flexible electrodes or organic photovoltaics (OPV). Here, a single‐layer conformal encapsulation method is demonstrated via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) for organic conductor, poly (3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The accelerated degradation tests at 100 °C show that the conductivity of encapsulated PEDOT can be retained up to 17 times longer than that of the unencapsulated counterpart. PEDOT degradation and encapsulation mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, the versatility of the iCVD encapsulation on a top‐illuminated OPV architecture that can be used to produce low‐cost photovoltaics devices on various unconventional substrates (e.g., paper) is demonstrated. Unlike previous approaches of using solely water/oxygen barriers, the encapsulation effect of polymer films on OPV devices is improved by a thin layer capping of evaporated UV‐screening material, Cerium(IV) oxide (CeO2) over the iCVD polymer layer. This bilayer encapsulation strategy efficiently slows the degradation of OPVs and represents a new method to encapsulate OPV and other organic devices."
472,10.1093/INFDIS/151.3.420,1985,Oral poliovirus vaccine: history of its development and use and current challenge to eliminate poliomyelitis from the world.,"Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is like no other live virus vaccine used in humans: vaccine strains multiply extensively in the intestinal tract, are widely disseminated in the family and community, and immunize a large proportion of the unvaccinated population. During the search for optimal strains for vaccine use, motor neurons in the spinal cord of chimpanzees (and by extrapolation those of humans) were found to be much more resistant to polioviruses than those of monkeys; the reverse was true for the alimentary tract. Various biologic properties of polioviruses also varied quantitatively over a wide spectrum and were genetically distinct. The phenomenon of somewhat increased neurovirulence for monkeys, but not for chimpanzees, encountered in excreted virus was extensively studied in families, in children's homes, and finally among hundreds of thousands of susceptible children and adults in areas where only 50% of the susceptible population received OPV; these studies did not reveal evidence of danger. During the past 20 years approximately 5 million cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were probably prevented by OPV in predominantly temperate-climate countries inhabited by approximately 2 billion people. OPV has also been used less extensively and not optimally in many tropical and subtropical countries, where paralytic poliomyelitis is now known to be an important public health problem, with reduction in numbers of cases but not elimination of the disease except in some countries with better health services. Experience in Cuba during the past 21 years, in Brazil during the past 5 years, and in the Dominican Republic during the past 2 years has shown that the strategy of annual short-term vaccination of all children in the most susceptible age groups can rapidly eliminate the disease from tropical and subtropical countries."

474,10.1073/pnas.1506699112,2015,Collection-limited theory interprets the extraordinary response of single semiconductor organic solar cells,"Significance We demonstrate that, instead of the charge generation mechanism, charge collection can readily explain the bottleneck toward higher efficiency single organic semiconductor based OPVs (SS-OPVs). This change in archetype has the potential to transform the design rules for materials used in OPV devices and would inspire searches for a completely different set of polymers for OPV cells. Furthermore, we believe that our findings will broaden the understanding of the physics of charge transport and the impact of charged defect states in organic electronic devices. Hence, this work should have deep and immediate impact on the chemists, materials scientists, and device physicists in the field and would be of broad interest to the organic electronics community. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) architecture has dominated the literature due to its ability to be implemented in devices with relatively high efficiency values. However, a simpler device architecture based on a single organic semiconductor (SS-OPV) offers several advantages: it obviates the need to control the highly system-dependent nanoscale BHJ morphology, and therefore, would allow the use of broader range of organic semiconductors. Unfortunately, the photocurrent in standard SS-OPV devices is typically very low, which generally is attributed to inefficient charge separation of the photogenerated excitons. Here we show that the short-circuit current density from SS-OPV devices can be enhanced significantly (∼100-fold) through the use of inverted device configurations, relative to a standard OPV device architecture. This result suggests that charge generation may not be the performance bottleneck in OPV device operation. Instead, poor charge collection, caused by defect-induced electric field screening, is most likely the primary performance bottleneck in regular-geometry SS-OPV cells. We justify this hypothesis by: (i) detailed numerical simulations, (ii) electrical characterization experiments of functional SS-OPV devices using multiple polymers as active layer materials, and (iii) impedance spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, we show that the collection-limited photocurrent theory consistently interprets typical characteristics of regular SS-OPV devices. These insights should encourage the design and OPV implementation of high-purity, high-mobility polymers, and other soft materials that have shown promise in organic field-effect transistor applications, but have not performed well in BHJ OPV devices, wherein they adopt less-than-ideal nanostructures when blended with electron-accepting materials."

By doping rubrene into standard CuPc∕C60 OPV cell, a high JSC of 30.1mA∕cm2, VOC of 0.58V, and an exceptionally high power conversion efficiency of 5.58% are achieved. The performance improvement is mainly attributed to efficient light absorption by rubrene in the range of 460–530nm where two hosts have low absorbance, leading to more effective exciton formation. Their findings motivate the use of fluorescent dyes for maximizing absorption spectral coverage as well as increasing photon harvesting."
476,10.1002/adfm.200801723,2009,"Organic Photovoltaic Cells Based On Solvent‐Annealed, Textured Titanyl Phthalocyanine/C60 Heterojunctions","Organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) with good near‐IR photoactivity are created from highly textured titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc)/C60 heterojunctions. Vacuum deposited TiOPc thin films are converted to the near‐IR absorbing “Phase II” polymorph using post‐deposition solvent annealing. The Phase I → Phase II transition broadens the absorbance spectrum of the Pc film producing absorptivities (α ≈ 105 cm−1) from 600–900 nm, along with substantial texturing of the Pc layer. Atomic force microscopy and field‐emission scanning electron microscopy of the solvent annealed films show that the surface roughness of the Pc layers is increased by a factor of greater than 2× as a result of the phase transformation. Current–voltage (J–V) responses for white light illumination of ITO (100 nm)/TiOPc (20 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) OPVs show a near doubling of the short‐circuit photocurrent (JSC), with only a small decrease in open‐circuit photopotential (VOC), and a concomitant increase in power conversion efficiency. Incident photon current efficiency (IPCE) plots confirmed the enhanced near‐IR OPV activity, with maximum IPCE values of ca. 30% for devices using Phase II‐only TiOPc films. UV‐photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of TiOPc/C60 heterojunctions, for both Phase I and Phase II TiOPc films, suggest that the Phase II polymorph has nearly the same HOMO energy as seen in the Phase I polymorph, and similar frontier orbital energy offsets, EHOMOPc–ELUMOC60, leading to comparable open‐circuit photovoltages.

However, the reasons for the enhanced performances remain unclear. In this work, we show that defect states play an important, if not dominating, role in improving the OPV performances. The changes in both the density of defect states and the work function of MoO3 with annealing are shown and correlated with the OPV device performance. The increased defect densities improve the OPV performance through an enhanced hole extraction rate at the MoO3/organic interface. The reduction in work function, however, reduces the interface field that can possibly lower mobility near the interface and reduce the electron-blocking effect. This plays a role in saturation of the device performance. This work, therefore, shows the importance of the defects in MoO3 as an ABL and a dominance of defect-enhanced extraction over a field-enhanced extraction process."

Self-assembly of these molecules induced gelation of hydrocarbon solvents at low concentrations (<1 mM), resulting in high aspect ratio nanostructures. Electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies revealed twisted and entangled supramolecular tapes of an average of 50-200 nm in width, 12-20 nm in thickness, and several micrometers in length. The hierarchical growth of the entangled tapes and the consequent gelation is attributed to the lamellar-type packing of the molecules, facilitated by cooperative hydrogen bonding, pi stacking, and van der Waals interactions between the OPV units. Gelation of OPVs induced remarkable changes in the absorption and emission properties, which indicated strong electronic interaction in the aggregated chromophores. Comparison of the absorption and emission spectra in the gel form and in the solid film indicated a similar chromophore organization in both phases. The presence of self-assembled aggregates of OPVs was confirmed by solvent- and temperature-dependent changes in the absorption and emission properties, and by selective excitation experiments. This is the first detailed report of the gelation-induced formation of OPV nanotapes, assisted by weak, nondirectional hydrogen-bonding motifs and pi-pi stacking. These findings may provide opportunities for the design of a new class of functional soft materials and nanoarchitectures, based on pi-conjugated organic semiconductor-type molecules, thereby enabling the manipulation of their optical properties."
483,10.1093/infdis/jix128,2017,Lessons From Globally Coordinated Cessation of Serotype 2 Oral Poliovirus Vaccine for the Remaining Serotypes,"Abstract Background. Comparing model expectations with the experience of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) containing serotype 2 (OPV2) cessation can inform risk management for the expected cessation of OPV containing serotypes 1 and 3 (OPV13). Methods. We compare the expected post-OPV2-cessation OPV2-related viruses from models with the evidence available approximately 6 months after OPV2 cessation. We also model the trade-offs of use vs nonuse of monovalent OPV (mOPV) for outbreak response considering all 3 serotypes. Results. Although too early to tell definitively, the observed die-out of OPV2-related viruses in populations that attained sufficiently intense trivalent OPV (tOPV) use prior to OPV2 cessation appears consistent with model expectations. As expected, populations that did not intensify tOPV use prior to OPV2 cessation show continued circulation of serotype 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). Failure to aggressively use mOPV to respond to circulating VDPVs results in a high risk of uncontrolled outbreaks that would require restarting OPV. Conclusions. Ensuring a successful endgame requires more aggressive OPV cessation risk management than has occurred to date for OPV2 cessation. This includes maintaining high population immunity to transmission up until OPV13 cessation, meeting all prerequisites for OPV cessation, and ensuring sufficient vaccine supply to prevent and respond to outbreaks."
484,10.1086/596052,2009,Transmission of imported vaccine-derived poliovirus in an undervaccinated community in Minnesota.,"BACKGROUND
Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has not been used in the United States since 2000. Type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) was identified in September 2005, from an unvaccinated Amish infant hospitalized in Minnesota with severe combined immunodeficiency. An investigation was conducted to determine the source of the virus and its means of transmission.


METHODS
The infant was tested serially for poliovirus excretion. Investigations were conducted to detect poliovirus infections or paralytic poliomyelitis in Amish communities in Minnesota, neighboring states, and Ontario, Canada. Genomic sequences of poliovirus isolates were determined for phylogenetic analysis.


RESULTS
No source for the VDPV could be identified. In the index community, 8 (35%) of 23 children tested, including the infant, had evidence of type 1 poliovirus or VDPV infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the VDPV circulated in the community for approximately 2 months before the infant's infection was detected and that the initiating OPV dose had been given before her birth. No paralytic disease was found in the community, and no poliovirus infections were found in other Amish communities investigated.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first demonstrated transmission of VDPV in an undervaccinated community in a developed country. Continued vigilance is needed in all countries to identify poliovirus infections in communities at high risk of poliovirus transmission."

Sunlight collected and concentrated outdoors was focused into an optical fiber and delivered onto a 1 cm2 bulk-heterojunction cell. Sunlight concentration C was varied gradually from 0.2 to 27 suns. Power conversion efficiency exhibited slow increase with C that was followed by saturation around 2% at C=0.5–2.5 suns and subsequent strong reduction. Possible OPV applications in stationary solar concentrators (C≤2 suns) are discussed. Finally, experiments at C=55–58 suns demonstrated potential of our approach for accelerated studies of light induced mechanisms in the OPV degradation."

The active layer exhibits 100% photoluminescence quenching due to the small nanofiber diameter, indicating that the excitons are efficiently dissociated. The electrospun PCDTBT nanofibers absorb more photons at longer wavelengths, leading to improved photon harvesting. OPV devices composed of PCDTBT nanofibers show a high short circuit current of 11.54 mA cm(-2) and a high power conversion efficiency of 5.82%. The increase in the short circuit current is attributed to enhanced photon harvesting and charge transport. This method may be applied to the fabrication, in ambient air, of large-area active layers composed of other new conjugated polymers to yield high-performance OPV devices."

Importance of Interfacial Energy Level Matching,"This contribution describes the design, synthesis, characterization, and organic photovoltaic (OPV) device implementation of a novel interfacial layer (IFL) for insertion between the anode and active layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk-heterojunction solar cells. The IFL precursor, 5,5′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)phenylamino]-2,2′-bithiophene (PABTSi2), covalently anchors to the Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) surface via the −SiCl3 groups and incorporates a bithiophene unit to align the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy with that of P3HT (5.0 eV). The synthesis and subsequent electrochemical analysis of PABTSi2 indicates a HOMO energy of 4.9 eV, while the lowest uoccupied molecular orbital level remains sufficiently high, at 2.2 eV, to effectively block electron leakage to the OPV ITO anode. For the P3HT:PCBM OPV fabrication, PABTSi2 is used as a spin-coated cross-linked (via −SiCl3 hydrolysis and condensation) 1:2 blend with poly[9,9-d..."
488,10.1557/OPL.2014.88,2014,Market Readiness of Organic Photovoltaics for Building Integration,"If a photovoltaic (PV) technology is assessed today in a technical framework, then efficiency is the most commonly addressed parameter, followed by service lifetime. Cost, as the third parameter of the ""magic triangle"", is even less often reported. However, if a new technology is prepared to enter a market, other important parameters have to be considered, especially if non-standard PV applications are targeted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) is a well known but young PV technology of the so called third generation, which offers unique advantages for integrated products such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). In this contribution we would like to highlight some of the advantages and challenges which are specific to the application of OPV in the field of building integration. Architectural design features of OPV include the ability to adapt semi-transparency, color and shape of the module. Moreover, glass-laminated OPV modules are deemed suitable for BIPV because of their ease of integration, good fire resistance, high energy harvest per nominal watt-peak and long lifetimes."
489,10.1084/jem.20071854,2008,The orthopoxvirus type I IFN binding protein is essential for virulence and an effective target for vaccination,"Nonliving antiviral vaccines traditionally target proteins expressed at the surface of the virion with the hope of inducing neutralizing antibodies. Orthopoxviruses (OPVs), such as the human smallpox virus and the mouse-equivalent ectromelia virus (ECTV; an agent of mousepox), encode immune response modifiers (IRMs) that can increase virulence by decreasing the host immune response. We show that one of these IRMs, the type I interferon (IFN) binding protein (bp) of ECTV, is essential for ECTV virulence and is a natural target of the antibody response. More strikingly, we demonstrate that immunization with recombinant type I IFN bp protects mice from lethal mousepox. Collectively, our experiments have important implications for our understanding of the role of IRMs in OPV virulence and of type I IFNs in OPV infections. Furthermore, our work provides proof of concept that effective antiviral vaccines can be made to prevent disease by targeting virulence factors as an alternative to the traditional approach that attempts to prevent infection by virus neutralization."
490,10.1002/ADFM.200900214,2009,Tuning Conversion Efficiency in Metallo Endohedral Fullerene‐Based Organic Photovoltaic Devices,"Here the influence that 1‐(3‐hexoxycarbonyl)propyl‐1‐phenyl‐[6,6]‐Lu3N@C81, Lu3N@C80–PCBH, a novel acceptor material, has on active layer morphology and the performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices using this material is reported. Polymer/fullerene blend films with poly(3‐hexylthiophene), P3HT, donor material and Lu3N@C80–PCBH acceptor material are studied using absorption spectroscopy, grazing incident X‐ray diffraction and photocurrent spectra of photovoltaic devices. Due to a smaller molecular orbital offset the OPV devices built with Lu3N@C80–PCBH display increased open circuit voltage over empty cage fullerene acceptors. The photovoltaic performance of these metallo endohedral fullerene blend films is found to be highly impacted by the fullerene loading. The results indicate that the optimized blend ratio in a P3HT matrix differs from a molecular equivalent of an optimized P3HT/[6,6]‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric methyl ester, C60–PCBM, active layer, and this is related to the physical differences of the C80 fullerene. The influence that active layer annealing has on the OPV performance is further evaluated. Through properly matching the film processing and the donor/acceptor ratio, devices with power conversion efficiency greater than 4% are demonstrated."
491,10.1002/chem.200801255,2008,Self-assembly of oligo(para-phenylenevinylene)s through arene-perfluoroarene interactions: pi gels with longitudinally controlled fiber growth and supramolecular exciplex-mediated enhanced emission.,"The arene-perfluoroarene (ArH-ArF) interaction, which has been extensively studied in the field of solid-state chemistry, is exploited in the hierarchical self-assembly of oligo(para-phenylenevinylene)s (OPVs) with controlled longitudinal fiber growth that leads to gelation. The size of the self-assembled fibers of a pentafluorophenyl-functionalized OPV 5 could be controlled through C-FH--C hydrogen bonding and pi stacking. The ability of fluoroaromatic compounds to form excited-state complexes with aromatic amines has been utilized to form a supramolecular exciplex, exclusively in the gel state, that exhibits enhanced emission. Thus, the commonly encountered fluorescence quenching during the self-assembly of OPVs could be considerably prevented by exciplex formation with N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA), which only occurred for the fluorinated OPV and not for the non-fluorinated analogue 4. In the former case, a threefold enhancement in the emission intensity could be observed in the gel state, whereas no change in emission occurred in solution. Thus, the major limitations of spontaneous fiber growth and fluorescence self-quenching encountered in the self-assembly of OPVs could be controlled to a great extent by using the versatile ArH-ArF interaction."
492,10.1039/C1JM12449H,2012,"Cyclopentadithiophene-benzothiadiazole oligomers and polymers; synthesis, characterisation, field-effect transistor and photovoltaic characteristics",Conjugated oligomers with various ratios of cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) to benzothiadiazole (BT) repeating units are reported. These oligomers can be polymerised to high molecular weight polymers (Mn > 100k) by oxidative polymerisation using iron(III)chloride. The electronic properties of these materials were examined by cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis spectroscopy and the results compared to those calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Polymers with optimum ratios of CPDT : BT (2 : 1) units show hole mobilities in excess of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 as the active layer in organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices of these polymers with PCBM as the electron acceptor show a power conversion efficiency of 2.1% when processed in the absence of any additives. The reported OFET performance is significantly higher than the parent PCPDTBT alternating copolymer (CPDT : BT = 1 : 1) and also shows a moderate improvement in OPV performance.

494,10.1128/JVI.00945-06,2006,Genome of Horsepox Virus,"ABSTRACT Here we present the genomic sequence of horsepox virus (HSPV) isolate MNR-76, an orthopoxvirus (OPV) isolated in 1976 from diseased Mongolian horses. The 212-kbp genome contained 7.5-kbp inverted terminal repeats and lacked extensive terminal tandem repetition. HSPV contained 236 open reading frames (ORFs) with similarity to those in other OPVs, with those in the central 100-kbp region most conserved relative to other OPVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved region indicated that HSPV is closely related to sequenced isolates of vaccinia virus (VACV) and rabbitpox virus, clearly grouping together these VACV-like viruses. Fifty-four HSPV ORFs likely represented fragments of 25 orthologous OPV genes, including in the central region the only known fragmented form of an OPV ribonucleotide reductase large subunit gene. In terminal genomic regions, HSPV lacked full-length homologues of genes variably fragmented in other VACV-like viruses but was unique in fragmentation of the homologue of VACV strain Copenhagen B6R, a gene intact in other known VACV-like viruses. Notably, HSPV contained in terminal genomic regions 17 kbp of OPV-like sequence absent in known VACV-like viruses, including fragments of genes intact in other OPVs and approximately 1.4 kb of sequence present only in cowpox virus (CPXV). HSPV also contained seven full-length genes fragmented or missing in other VACV-like viruses, including intact homologues of the CPXV strain GRI-90 D2L/I4R CrmB and D13L CD30-like tumor necrosis factor receptors, D3L/I3R and C1L ankyrin repeat proteins, B19R kelch-like protein, D7L BTB/POZ domain protein, and B22R variola virus B22R-like protein. These results indicated that HSPV contains unique genomic features likely contributing to a unique virulence/host range phenotype. They also indicated that while closely related to known VACV-like viruses, HSPV contains additional, potentially ancestral sequences absent in other VACV-like viruses."
495,10.1021/ja809367u,2009,Helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers as organizational scaffolds for photoinduced charge transfer.,"Here we report the synthesis and characterization of four quinoline-derived foldamers with increasing oligomeric length; dimer O2P, tetramer O4P, pentamer O5P, and nonamer O9P functionalized with on one end an oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (OPV) and on the other end a perylene bisimide (PB) chromophore. (1)H NMR confirms the formation of the expected folded structures in both toluene and chloroform solution. The structural predictability and rigidity of the oligomeric series enabled us to investigate the effect of a helical bridge and chromophore position on the photoinduced processes in the electron OPV-PB donor-acceptor pair in chloroform and toluene. The helical properties of the bridge ensured that the chromophore separation distance through space is different from the separation distance through the bridge. For all foldamer-solvent combinations studied, excitation of either OPV or PB results in nearly quantitative quenching of the fluorescence indicating a fast charge separation reaction between the OPV and PB. Femtosecond photoinduced absorption measurements confirmed the fast formation of a charge-separated state. The recombination reaction involves a combination of direct decay to the ground state and the formation of an intermediate triplet state, with their balance depending on the foldamer-solvent combination. Molecular orbital calculations rationalize the fast photoinduced charge separation, by revealing that the bridging foldamer mediates the charge transfer from donor to acceptor via the superexchange mechanism. Remarkably low attenuation factors (beta(CS) approximately 10(-2) A(-1)) were obtained using either through space or through bridge separation distance. However, in these calculations only three of the four foldamers show the expected linear behavior between the logarithm of the charge separation rate constant and the distance between the chromophores. The combined results show when a helical bridge is separating the charge transfer couple, hampering the usefulness of a uniform description of the charge-separation phenomena."
496,10.1021/JA0568042,2006,Influence of intermolecular orientation on the photoinduced charge transfer kinetics in self-assembled aggregates of donor-acceptor arrays.,"The kinetics of photoinduced charge transfer reactions in covalently linked donor-acceptor molecules often undergoes dramatic changes when these molecules self-assemble from a molecular dissolved state into a nanoaggregate. Frequently, the origin of these changes is only partially understood. In this paper, we describe the intermolecular spatial organization of three homologous arrays, consisting of a central perylene bisimide (PERY) acceptor moiety and two oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (OPV) donor units, in nanoaggregates and identify both face-to-face (H-type) and slipped (J-type) stacking of the OPV and PERY chromophores. For the J-type aggregates, short intermolecular OPV-PERY distances are created that give rise to a charge-transfer absorption band. The proximity of the donor and acceptor groups in the J-type aggregates enables a highly efficient photoinduced charge separation with a rate (k(cs) > 10(12) s(-1)) that significantly exceeds the rate of the intramolecular charge transfer of the same compounds when molecularly dissolved, even in the most polar media. In the H-type aggregates, on the other hand, the intermolecular OPV-PERY distance is not reduced compared to the intramolecular separation, and hence, the rates of the electron transfer reactions are not significantly affected compared to the molecular dissolved state. Similar to the forward electron transfer, the kinetics of the charge recombination in the aggregated state can be understood by considering the different interchromophoric distances that occur in the H- and J-type aggregates. These results provide the first consistent rationalization of the remarkable differences that are observed for photoinduced charge-transfer reactions of donor-acceptor compounds in molecularly dissolved versus aggregated states."
497,10.1021/JA010330Z,2001,Conformational gating of long distance electron transfer through wire-like bridges in donor-bridge-acceptor molecules.,"A series of five donor-bridge-acceptor (DBA) molecules in which the donor is tetracene, the acceptor is pyromellitimide, and the bridge molecules are oligo-p-phenylenevinylenes (OPV) of increasing length has been shown to undergo electron transfer (ET) by means of two mechanisms. When the bridge is short, strongly distance dependent superexchange dynamics dominates, whereas when the bridge is longer, bridge-assisted hopping dynamics prevails. The latter mechanism results in relatively soft distance dependence for ET in which the OPV oligomers act effectively as molecular wires. We now report studies on the critical influence that bridge dynamics have on electron transfer through these oligomers. The temperature dependence of the charge separation (CS) rates in all five molecules does not appear to obey the predictions of standard ET theories based upon the Condon approximation. All five molecules show behavior consistent with CS being ""gated"" by torsional motion between the tetracene donor and the first bridge phenyl ring. This is based on the near equivalence of the CS activation energies measured for all five molecules with the frequency of a known vibrational mode in 5-phenyltetracene. In the molecule containing a trans-stilbene bridge, a competition occurs between the tetracene-phenyl torsional motion and one that occurs between the vinyl group and the phenyls linked to it. This results in complex temperature-dependent CS that exhibits both activated and negatively activated regimes. The charge recombination (CR) reactions within the molecules which have the two shortest bridges, namely phenyl and trans-stilbene, show a weaker dependence on these molecular motions. The three molecules with the longest bridges all display complex temperature dependencies in both their rates of CS and CR, most likely because of the complex torsional motions, which arise from the multiple phenyl-vinyl linkages. The data show that long-distance electron transfer and therefore wire-like behavior within conjugated bridge molecules depend critically on these low-frequency torsional motions. Molecular device designs that utilize such bridges will need to address these issues."
498,10.1039/B810748C,2008,Flexible organic photovoltaics from zinc oxide nanowires grown on transparent and conducting single walled carbon nanotube thin films,The fabrication of flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) which utilize transparent and conducting single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) thin films as current collecting electrodes on plastic substrates in zinc oxide nanowire (ZnO NW)/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices is reported. The bulk heterojunctions for exciton dissociation are created by directly growing ZnO nanowires from solution on the SWNT electrodes and spin coating the P3HT polymer. A maximum OPV power conversion efficiency of ∼0.6% was achieved. Our results indicate that nanotube–nanowire hybrids fabricated via solution based methods are promising for optoelectronic and energy harvesting devices.
499,10.1002/pssa.201228040,2012,Graphene oxide/PEDOT:PSS and reduced graphene oxide/PEDOT:PSS hole extraction layers in organic photovoltaic cells,"A comparison was made between the use of graphene oxide (GO)/poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/PEDOT:PSS as a hole extraction layer (HEL) in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Hydrazine hydrate (HYD) and the thermal method were adopted to change the GO to rGO. The OPV cell with the GO (∼2 nm)/PEDOT:PSS HEL exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 3.53% under 100 mW/cm2 illumination and air mass conditions, which is higher than that of the OPV cell without the HEL, viz. 1.78%. The device with the PEDOT:PSS/GO HEL shows a similar PCE of 3.48%. However, the PCE of the OPV cell with the rGO/PEDOT:PSS HEL is not high as those of the cells with the HYD‐rGO/PEDOT:PSS and T‐rGO/PEDOT:PSS, viz. 3.3 and 3.37%, respectively. The work function of GO was 4.7 eV, but those of HYD‐rGO and T‐rGO were 4.2 and 4.5 eV, respectively, suggesting that the decrease of the barrier height between GO and active materials is higher than that in rGO case."
