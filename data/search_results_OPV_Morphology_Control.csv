0,,2020.0,Degradation Behavior of Scalable Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells Assessed by Outdoor and Indoor ISOS Stability Protocols,"the scalable NFA OPV exhibit completely reversible degradation when assessed in ISOS - O - 1 outdoor conditions, which is in contrast to the lab - scale devices assessed via the indoor ISOS - L - 2 protocol. Results from transient photovoltage (TPV) indicate the presence of charge trap formation, and a number of potential mechanisms are proposed for the selective occurrence of this in lab - scale devices tested in ISOS - L lab conditions – ultimately concluding that it has its origins in the different device architectures used. The study points at the risk of assessing active layer stability from laboratory scale devices and degradation studies alone"
1,10.1063/5.0025622,2020.0,Outdoor performance of organic photovoltaics at two different locations: A comparison of degradation and the effect of condensation,"Tests on organic photovoltaics (OPV) mini modules, fabricated through a R2R process, in air and without hazardous solvents have been conducted in order to compare their outdoor performance, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and Bangor, North Wales, and assess the impact of the latitude and climate of the installation on the power generation and modules' lifetime. The test showed different profiles of degradation for each region and formulation, with a surprisingly faster degradation in Bangor. One of the possible sources of the increased degradation is the greater levels of condensation observed in Bangor. To verify the impact of condensation on the module stability, indoor tests have been conducted to relate the dew point depression to module degradation times. The results show that condensation is a significant stress factor in OPV and should be considered more prominently in reliability studies."
2,,2017.0,Outdoor stability studies in Organic Photovoltaics,"This thesis focuses on the outdoor monitoring of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with the aim of improving the stability and performance of OPVs under real world conditions. This is important as in order for OPVs to become commercially viable they must make the transition from small laboratory cells to larger modules. 
Over the course of several outdoor monitoring campaigns various types of OPV modules have been benchmarked against a number of other technologies: polycrystalline silicon, cadmium indium diselenide and dye sensitised solar cells. The principal performance parameters are examined in detail, analysing their dependence on irradiance and temperature. OPVs were shown to have positive temperature coefficients for efficiency, ISC and fill factor and a negative temperature coefficient for VOC. One of the main causes of degradation is ingress of water and oxygen into the module and subsequent photo-oxidation of the active layer and it was shown that UV filtering would improve stability. 
To improve the yield of OPVs outdoors, modules were laminated to different corrugated substrates and subjected to indoor characterisation and outdoor monitoring. The corrugated modules were shown to have three advantages: the effective area of the module, allowing for curvature, is reduced which leads to an improvement in the power conversion efficiency per unit area; substantial enhancement at high angles of incidence led to increased output during early morning and evening; under diffuse irradiance performance improved by up to 25%. Outdoor measurements on larger module strips showed that corrugated strips outperformed flat strips by 7.5% with a 14.8% enhancement under diffuse conditions. 
An alternative technique to improve the yield of OPVs is the use of luminescent down-shifting coatings which were investigated as alternatives to UV filters and have the added benefit of improving stability. The use of both discrete and multiple-dye blends dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate) led to improvements in performance of up to 8% and a six-fold extension of operational lifetime. Dyes were systematically selected by examining their absorption and photoluminescence spectra and matching these to the spectral performance of P3HT:PC61BM OPV devices. In doing so optimised multiple-dye blends were made possible."
3,,2018.0,Optimization of the interfaces of encapsulated OPV devices,"In order to limit the flexible organic photovoltaic devices degradation induced by moisture andoxygen, the solar cells are encapsulated between two gas-barrier films. Despite the importanceof the encapsulation processes and their potential influence on the initial performances as well asduring aging of the devices, they are scarcely described in the literature. Furthermore, severalfield aging studies showed that mechanical degradation could limit the devices lifetime beforetheir photo-chemical stability became an issue. Thus, adhesion between the different layerscomposing the devices is a critical factor in order to develop flexible OPV devices reliable aftertheir manufacturing and during their use.In this work, two encapsulation protocols were studied: the roll-to-roll lamination of apressure sensitive adhesive and the vacuum lamination of a hotmelt thermoplastic. In order toquantify the adhesion strength of every interface comprised in the samples, the 180° peelingtest mechanical characterization was adapted for and then applied to the flexible devices. Inaddition, non-destructive imaging characterization techniques were developed: the laser-beaminduced-current mapping and the luminescence emission imaging under optical and electricalexcitation. Thank to these techniques, the hypothesis of a mechanical degradation occurringduring the roll-to-roll lamination process was made. Answers allowing for the improvement ofthe interfaces identified as weak were searched for and evaluated with respect to the photovoltaicperformances of the reference devices. The imaging techniques previously developed were alsoapplied along the accelerated aging of encapsulated cells. A mechanism was proposed, whichallows one to explain the localization of the degradation but also the failure type, either opticalor electrical, occurring during each aging step."
4,10.1002/cjce.25487,2024.0,Effect of pre‐aging intermediate layers on the performance of multi‐layer organic photovoltaic devices,"Understanding the degradation behaviour of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is an essential part to improve their stability prior to massive production. Accelerated aging can help to assess their stability and study the underlying degradation mechanisms of OPVs. Most studies focus on individual layers or a full device, and little is known about the role a pre‐aged layer stack plays in the performance of a device. Herein, we report the investigation of the effects of pre‐aging of multiple layers on the performance of OPVs. Instead of aging a single layer or an entire stack (sequential layers: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MoOx/F‐BsubPc/C60/BCP/Ag), our process involved aging the intermediate layer stack for 24 h after depositing a specific layer before continuing with the subsequent depositions to fully fabricate/manufacture OPVs. Aging was conducted under four controlled conditions considering parameters including moisture, gas type, and temperature in the absence of light according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols. Short of PEDOT:PSS we found that multiple layers, being subjected to the parameters, resulted in a decline in OPV device performance after being fully manufactured. Device performance is evaluated based on short‐circuit current density (Jsc), power conversion efficiency (PCE), and open‐circuit voltage (Voc). Our analysis provides insight into the degradation mechanisms of layered/planar OPV structures and offers strategic guidance for optimizing fabrication processes, particularly during the layer deposition transitions. We recommend that during OPV vacuum deposited fabrication, intermediate layers should be protected from moisture, O2, high temperature, and even inert gases, preferably in a low‐vacuum environment."
5,10.1002/advs.201800434,2018.0,Current Status of Outdoor Lifetime Testing of Organic Photovoltaics,"Performance degradation is one of the key obstacles limiting the commercial application of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The assessment of OPV stability and lifetime are usually based on simulated degradation experiments conducted under indoor conditions, whereas photovoltaic devices experience different environmental conditions under outdoor operation. Besides the intrinsic degradation of OPV devices due to the evolution of optoelectronic and morphological structure during long‐term operation, outdoor environmental changes can impose extra stresses and accelerate the degradation of OPV modules. Although outdoor studies on long‐term OPV stability are restricted by the long data collection times, they provide direct information on OPV stability under mixed degradation stresses and are therefore invaluable from the point of view of both research and practical application. Here, an overview of the current status of outdoor lifetime studies of OPVs is provided. After a summary of device lifetime extrapolated from indoor studies, outdoor lifetime testing platforms are introduced and the operational lifetime of various OPV devices are reviewed. The influence of climate and weather parameters on device performance and burn‐in phenomena observed during the degradation of OPVs is then discussed. Finally, an outlook and directions for future research in this field are suggested."
6,10.1109/PVSC.2012.6318270,2012.0,Accelerated stability testing of organic photovoltaics using concentrated sunlight,We suggest to use concentrated sunlight for accelerated studies of light-induced mechanisms in the degradation of organic photovoltaics (OPV) based on the polymer (P3HT)/fullerene (PCBM) bulk heterojunctions. Two particular cases of the degradation are reported.
7,10.1021/acsami.7b19442,2018.0,Influence of Environmentally Affected Hole-Transport Layers on Spatial Homogeneity and Charge-Transport Dynamics of Organic Solar Cells.,"After organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells achieved efficiency of more than 10%, the control of stability and degradation mechanisms of solar cells became a prominent task. The increase of device efficiency due to incorporation of a hole-transport layer (HTL) in bulk-heterojunction solar cells has been extensively reported. However, the most widely used HTL material, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is frequently suspected to be the dominating source for device instability under environmental conditions. Thereby, effects like photooxidation and electrode corrosion are often reported to shorten device lifetime. However, often in environmental device studies, the source of degradation, whether being from the HTL, the active layer, or the metal cathode is rather difficult to distinguish because the external diffusion of oxygen and water affects all components. In this study, different HTLs, namely, those prepared from traditional PEDOT:PSS and also two types of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) are exposed to different environments, such as oxygen, light, or humidity, prior to device finalization under inert conditions. This allows investigating any effects within the HTL and from reactions at its interface to the indium tin oxide electrode or the active layer. The surface and bulk chemistry of the exposed HTL has been monitored and discussed in context to the observed device physics, dynamic charge transport, and spatial performance homogeneity of the corresponding OPV device. The results show that merely humidity exposure of the HTL leads to decreased device performance for PEDOT:PSS, but also for one type of the tested MoO3. The losses are related to the amount of absorbed water in the HTL, inducing loss of active area in terms of interfacial contact. The device with PEDOT:PSS HTL after humid air exposure showed seriously decreased photocurrent by microdelamination of swelling/shrinkage of the hygroscopic layer. The colloidal MoO3 with water-based precursor solution presents slight decay of solar cell performance, also here caused by swelling/shrinking reaction, but by a combination of in-plane particle contact and resistance scaling with particle expansion. However, the device with quasi-continuous and alcohol-based MoO3 showed unharmed stable electrical performance."
8,10.1063/1.3298742,2010.0,Effects of concentrated sunlight on organic photovoltaics,"We report the effects of concentrated sunlight on key photovoltaic parameters and stability of organic photovoltaics (OPV). Sunlight collected and concentrated outdoors was focused into an optical fiber and delivered onto a 1 cm2 bulk-heterojunction cell. Sunlight concentration C was varied gradually from 0.2 to 27 suns. Power conversion efficiency exhibited slow increase with C that was followed by saturation around 2% at C=0.5–2.5 suns and subsequent strong reduction. Possible OPV applications in stationary solar concentrators (C≤2 suns) are discussed. Finally, experiments at C=55–58 suns demonstrated potential of our approach for accelerated studies of light induced mechanisms in the OPV degradation."
9,10.59627/cbens.2018.371,2018.0,LIFETIME STUDY OF ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC MATERIALS THROUGH OUTDOOR TESTS,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have undergone a significant development in recent years, with companies reaching efficiencies above 13%. Its unique features of transparency, light weight and flexibility allow the OPV application where conventional photovoltaics reach their limits, such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Many projects are emerging for this type of application, such as facade integration, and it is important to guarantee that the lifetime of the OPV devices is similar to what it is being integrated to. As a relatively recent technology, there are not many studies focusing on the stability and lifetime of OPV and even though standard tests have been defined for means of comparison of technology development, there are no appropriate qualification tests to assure the durability of the modules. As accelerated tests are not yet correlated to real operational conditions either, outdoor tests are a must to study degradation behaviors and pathways to improve the lifetime. In this paper, outdoor tests have been conducted for a period over a year to compare different photoactive materials and assess their stability under operational conditions. By the use of an in-house built software, the current-voltage measurements performed along the day hours were used to build degradation curves and model the energy generated over time. Differences in degradation rate were observed for the three polymers tested, as well as a relation between irradiation levels and the performance and stability of the devices."

11,,2016.0,Interfacial stability and degradation in organic photovoltaic solar cells,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells show great promise but suffer from short operating lifetimes. This study examines the role that the selection of materials for the hole extraction interface in inverted OPV devices plays in determining the lifetime of a device. In the first part of the study, the effects of thermal degradation were examined. It was found that devices containing MoO3 HTLs and silver top electrodes exhibit an open-circuit voltage (VOC)/fill factor (FF)-driven mechanism. Physical characterisation experiments showed that, with heating, the silver electrode undergoes de-wetting. With thin electrodes this can result in the catastrophic failure of the device. A fracture analysis study found that silver-containing devices experience an increase in adhesion of their top layers to the active layer due to interdiffusion between the layers. This interdiffusion may be related to the loss of VOC and FF in Ag/MoO3 devices through diffused species forming charge traps in the active layer. In the second part of the study, the effects of photodegradation in different atmospheres were studied. Some material-dependent effects were observed when the devices were aged in an inert atmosphere, including variations in projected lifetime. The effect of oxygen was to greatly accelerate degradation, and remove any of the material-dependence observed in the inert experiment, while humidity led to a substantial increase in the degradation rate of devices containing PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate). This study underlines the importance of considering device lifetime in device design, and choosing materials to minimise degradation."
12,10.1149/ma2023-024678mtgabs,2023.0,Revealing the Cycling and Degradation Mechanism of Bi-Metallates As Anode Materials for Na-Ion Batteries,"Na-ion batteries (NIBs) represent an emerging alternative to modern Li-ion batteries. To improve the overall performance of NIBs it is crucial to develop new types of anode materials with high capacity and long cycle life. Among the anode candidates, materials operating under combined conversion and alloying mechanisms (CAMs) are considered as promising. They are capable of delivering high capacity, however, despite theoretical predictions the cycling stability is still below expectations. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the cycling and degradation mechanisms of CAMs is crucial to improve their performance. However, these materials undergo multiple chemical transformations, which often involves formation of amorphous and nanocrystalline phases during cycling. Such chemical complexity substantially impedes their full characterization and understanding.
 Bismuth metallates, with a general formula of Bi-TM-O (TM = transition metal), is a group of ternary CAMs. Their general cycling mechanism consists of an irreversible conversion reaction, which leads to formation of Bi nanoparticles embedded in a Na-TM-O matrix during the first sodiation. This is followed by a reversible two-step alloying reaction leading to formation of Na3Bi with NaBi as an intermediate phase. In this work, we have used operando X-ray diffraction over the course of ∼30 cycles to study the cycling and degradation mechanisms of two CAMs - Bi2MoO6 and BiFeO3. With the help of ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, we have revealed new insights into these materials in addition to confirming the general cycling mechanism.
 Both materials form the cubic phase of Na3Bi (c-Na3Bi) in the sodiated state with some noticeable differences. While, the hexagonal Na3Bi (h-Na3Bi) phase starts to form after 10 cycles in Bi2MoO6, a combination of c-Na3Bi and h-Na3Bi can be observed after the first cycle in BiFeO3. The formation of c-Na3Bi is kinetically favorable in these systems, while h-Na3Bi is the more thermodynamically stable and, therefore, forms later in the cycling process. Both materials shows three distinct regions of capacity degradation, where the first is initiated by a growth in the crystallite sizes of Bi-particles. This is followed by a disappearance of the Bi-phase as the second step. The last degradation phase is related to the disappearance of the NaBi-phase and locking the system in the sodiated state. The present talk will discuss the mechanisms of these degradation steps in view of the future development of CAMs in greater details.

13,10.3390/pharmaceutics12020086,2020.0,Solid State Stability and Kinetics of Degradation for Candesartan—Pure Compound and Pharmaceutical Formulation,"The aim of this work was to assess the impact of an excipient in a pharmaceutical formulation containing candesartan cilexetil over the decomposition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and to comparatively investigate the kinetics of degradation during thermolysis in an oxidative atmosphere under controlled thermal stress. To achieve this, the samples were chosen as follows: pure candesartan cilexetil and a commercial tablet of 32 mg strength. As a first investigational tool, Universal attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (UATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was chosen in order to confirm the purity and identity of the samples, as well as to check if any interactions took place in the tablet between candesartan cilexetil and excipients under ambient conditions. Later on, samples were investigated by thermal analysis, and the elucidation of the decomposition mechanism was achieved solely after performing an in-depth kinetic study, namely the use of the modified non-parametric kinetics (NPK) method, since other kinetic methods (American Society for Testing and Materials—ASTM E698, Friedman and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa) led to inadvertencies. The NPK method suggested that candesartan cilexetil and the tablet were degraded by the contribution of two steps, the main being represented by chemical degradation and the secondary being a physical transformation. The excipients chosen in the formulation seemed to have a stabilizing effect on the decomposition of the candesartan cilexetil that was incorporated into the tablet, relative to pure active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), since the apparent activation energy for the decomposition of the tablet was 192.5 kJ/mol, in comparison to 154.5 kJ/mol for the pure API."
14,,2015.0,Structural-Functional Characterization of Degradation Mechanisms in Low Bandgap Polymer-Fullerene OPV Devices,"Polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) show enormous promise for low cost renewable energy production. In an effort to increase device efficiencies, recent attention has turned toward the utilization of low bandgap conjugated polymers for photon harvesting. However, the stability of devices based on low bandgap materials remains poorly understood and represents one of the primary roadblocks for widespread OPV commercialization. Developing a systematic approach for studying degradation mechanisms in low bandgap OPVs is critical for improving device lifetimes. In this study, an experimental procedure for identifying the specific location and trigger of different degradation mechanisms is outlined. Emphasis is placed on in situ structural-functional characterization of different device materials under a variety of environmental conditions with a focus on machine learning techniques for flexible data analysis."
15,10.1021/acsami.3c02071,2023.0,Improving the Stability of Non-fullerene-Based Organic Photovoltaics through Sequential Deposition and Utilization of a Quasi-orthogonal Solvent.,"The development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has led to a rapid improvement in their efficiency. Despite these improvements, significant performance degradation in the early stages of operation, known as burn-in, remains a challenge for NFA-based OPVs. To address this challenge, this study demonstrates a stable NFA-based OPV fabricated using sequential deposition (SqD) and a quasi-orthogonal solvent. The quasi-orthogonal solvent, which is prepared by incorporating 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) into dichloromethane (DCM), reduces the vapor pressure of the solvent and allows for the efficient dissolution and penetration of the Y6 (one of efficient NFAs) into a PM6 polymer-donor layer without damaging the latter. The resulting bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is characterized by a higher degree of crystallinity in the PM6 domains than that prepared using a conventional single-step deposition (SD) process. The OPV fabricated using the SqD process exhibits a PCE of 14.1% and demonstrates superior thermal stability to the SD-processed OPV. This study conclusively reveals that the formation of a thermally stable interface between the photoactive layer and the electron-transport layer (ETL) is the primary factor contributing to the high thermal stability observed in the SqD-processed OPV."
16,,1988.0,Studies on the stability of muroctasin and degradation products built under extreme conditions.,"Decomposition of N2-[(N-acetylmuramoyl)-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl]-N6-stearoyl-L-lysine (MDP-Lys(L18), muroctasin) under extreme conditions was investigated. MDP-Lys(L18) in an aqueous solution was heated under reflux for 4 h to give the decomposition products D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-4. Reaction of MDP-Lys(L18) with 0.1N NaOH at room temperature for 5 h gave D-1, and that with 1 N HCl under reflux for 1 h afforded D-4. MDP-Lys(L18) was found to be stable to light and heat. MDP-Lys(L18) in a powder form was stored at room temperature or at 25 degrees C and 75% relative humidity for 3 days to 18 months. Quantitative analysis, thin-layer chromatography, and tests for appearance and color change, etc., were performed in the stored samples. MDP-Lys(L18) was found to be stable, but hygroscopic."
17,,2019.0,Interfaces in organic photovoltaic devices: understanding the degradation mechanisms and improvement of the stability,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices now regularly reach 10% power conversion efficiency, especially now with the development of non-fullerene acceptors. However, those performances are not always very stable and, in order to improve the lifetime of these devices, a deep understanding of the different degradation mechanisms is needed. Degradation pathways are complex and diverse: they can be induced by numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors which can affect different regions of the device (active materials, interfaces, morphology, etc…). 
In the first part of this presentation, I will specifically focus on the degradation occurring at different interfaces in the multilayer which forms the OPV device. We identified several degradation mechanisms occurring at the bottom interface (ETL/Active layer) as well as at the top interfaces (Active layer/HTL/Electrode). 
In a second part, we studied the potentiality of graftable molecules such as self-assembled monolayers (SAM) to improve the stability of OPV devices. A solution to replace PEDOT:PSS in direct architecture was developed involving a thin layer of P3HT grafted on the ITO. 
These different studies highlight the role of the architecture and, more specifically, of the ETL, HTL and electrode in the stability of OPV devices. They also showed that functionalization of the metal oxides can be a solution to improve the stability of the devices."
18,10.3390/coatings12081071,2022.0,The Role of the Electron Transport Layer in the Degradation of Organic Photovoltaic Cells,"The performance of the electron transport layer (ETL) plays a critical role in extending the operational lifespan of organic photovoltaic devices. ZnO is an excellent electron transport layer used in the printable organic photovoltaic cells. A comparison of Ca and ZnO as the ETL in encapsulated bulk heterojunction OPV devices has been undertaken with the device stability dependence on light soaking, temperature, irradiance, and thermal cycling recorded. It was observed that the OPV devices using Ca ETL decayed faster than the ZnO ETL devices under the same light illumination. The degradation in a Ca ETL device is ascribed to the formation of an insulating calcium oxide layer at the ETL interfaces. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed a higher PL signal for the degraded Ca ETL devices compared to the ZnO ETL devices. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the ZnO ETL devices was found to be much more stable than the Ca devices. The PCE for ZnO ETL devices still retained 40% of their initial value while the Ca ETL devices failed completely over the period of 18 days in the study, leading to a clear outcome of the study."
19,10.1021/acsami.4c00056,2024.0,Tuning Surface Defect States in Sputtered Titanium Oxide Electron Transport Layers for Enhanced Stability of Organic Photovoltaics.,"Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have dramatically improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPV) in recent years; however, their device stability currently remains a bottleneck for further technological progress. Photocatalytic decomposition of nonfullerene acceptor molecules at metal oxide electron transport layer (ETL) interfaces has in several recent reports been demonstrated as one of the main degradation mechanisms for these high-performing OPV devices. While some routes for mitigating such degradation effects have been proposed, e.g., through a second layer integrated on the ETL surface, no clear strategy that complies with device scale-up and application requirements has been presented to date. In this work, it is demonstrated that the development of sputtered titanium oxide layers as ETLs in nonfullerene acceptor based OPV can lead to significantly enhanced device lifetimes. This is achieved by tuning the concentration of defect states at the oxide surface, via the reactive sputtering process, to mitigate the photocatalytic decomposition of NFA molecules at the metal oxide interlayers. Reduced defect state formation at the oxide surface is confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies, while the reduced photocatalytic decomposition of nonfullerene acceptor molecules is confirmed via optical spectroscopy investigations. The PBDB-T:ITIC organic solar cells show power conversion efficiencies of around 10% and significantly enhanced photostability. This is achieved through a reactive sputtering process that is fully scalable and industry compatible."
20,10.1039/C8TA04098B,2018.0,Influence of perfluorinated ionomer in PEDOT:PSS on the rectification and degradation of organic photovoltaic cells,"Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used to build optoelectronic devices. However, as a hygroscopic water-based acidic material, it brings major concerns for stability and degradation, resulting in an intense effort to replace it in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. In this work, we focus on the perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) polymeric additive to PEDOT:PSS. We demonstrate that it can reduce the relative amplitude of OPV device burn-in, and find two distinct regimes of influence. At low concentrations there is a subtle effect on wetting and work function, for instance, with a detrimental impact on the device characteristics, and above a threshold it changes the electronic and device properties. The abrupt threshold in the conducting polymer occurs for PFI concentrations greater than or equal to the PSS concentration and was revealed by monitoring variations in transmission, topography, work-function, wettability and OPV device characteristics. Below this PFI concentration threshold, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) are impaired largely by low fill-factors due to poor charge extraction. Above the PFI concentration threshold, we recover the PCE before it is improved beyond the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer based OPV devices. Supplementary to the performance enhancement, PFI improves OPV device stability and lifetime. Our degradation study leads to the conclusion that PFI prevents water from diffusing to and from the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer, which slows down the deterioration of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the aluminum electrode. These findings reveal mechanisms and opportunities that should be taken into consideration when developing components to inhibit OPV degradation."
21,10.1021/acsami.4c01154,2024.0,CPE-Na-Based Hole Transport Layers for Improving the Stability in Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Study,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have experienced significant development in the last decades after the introduction of nonfullerene acceptor molecules with top power conversion efficiencies reported over 19% and considerable versatility, for example, with application in transparent/semitransparent and flexible photovoltaics. Yet, the optimization of the operational stability continues to be a challenge. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of a conjugated polyelectrolyte polymer (CPE-Na) as a hole layer (HTL) to improve the performance and longevity of OPV cells. Two different fabrication approaches were adopted: integrating CPE-Na with PEDOT:PSS to create a composite HTL and using CPE-Na as a stand-alone bilayer deposited beneath PEDOT:PSS on the ITO substrate. These configurations were compared against a reference device employing PEDOT:PSS alone, as the HTL increased efficiency and fill factor. The instruments with CPE-Na also demonstrated increased stability in the dark and under simulated operational conditions. Device-based PEDOT:PSS as an HTL reached T80 after 2500 h while involving CPE-Na in the device kept at T90 in the same period, evidenced by a reduced degradation rate. Furthermore, the impedance spectroscopy and photoinduced transient methods suggest optimized charge transfer and reduced charge carrier recombination. These findings collectively highlight the potential of CPE-Na as a HTL optimizer material for nonfluorine OPV cells."
22,10.1002/adfm.202213220,2022.0,Laminated Organic Photovoltaic Modules for Agrivoltaics and Beyond: An Outdoor Stability Study of All‐Polymer and Polymer:Small Molecule Blends,"The integration of organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules on greenhouses is an encouraging practice to offset the energy demands of crop growth and provide extra functionality to dedicated farmland. Nevertheless, such OPV devices must meet certain optical and stability requirements to turn net zero energy greenhouse systems a reality. Here a donor:acceptor polymer blend is optimized for its use in laminated devices while matching the optical needs of crops. Optical modeling is performed and a greenhouse figure‐of‐merit is introduced to benchmark the trade‐off between photovoltaic performance and transparency for both chloroplasts and humans. Balanced donor:acceptor ratios result in better‐performing and more thermally stable devices than acceptor‐enriched counterparts. The optimized polymer blend and state‐of‐the‐art polymer:small‐molecule blends are next transferred to 25 cm2 laminated modules processed entirely from solution and in ambient conditions. The modules are mounted on a greenhouse as standalone or 4‐terminal tandem configurations and their outdoor stability is tracked for months. The study reveals degradation modes undetectable under laboratory conditions such as module delamination, which accounts for 10–20% loss in active area. Among the active layers tested, polymer:fullerene blends are the most stable and position as robust light harvesters in future building‐integrated OPV systems."
23,10.1021/acsami.1c12321,2021.0,A Multi-modal Approach to Understanding Degradation of Organic Photovoltaic Materials.,"State-of-the-art organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials are composed of complex, chemically diverse polymeric and molecular structures that form highly intricate solid-state interactions, collectively yielding exceptional tunability in performance and aesthetics. These properties are especially attractive for semitransparent power-generating windows or shades in living environments, greenhouses, or other architectural integrations. However, before such a future is realized, a broader and deeper understanding of property stability must be acquired. Stability during operating and environmental conditions is critical, namely, material color steadfastness, optoelectronic performance retention, morphological rigidity, and chemical robustness. To date, no single investigation encompasses all four distinct, yet interconnected, metrics. Here, we present a multimodal strategy that captures a dynamic and interconnected evolution of each property during the course of an accelerated photobleaching experiment. We demonstrate this approach across relevant length scales (from molecular to visual macroscale) using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, microwave conductivity, and time-dependent photobleaching spectroscopies for two high-performance semitransparent OPV blends-PDPP4T:PC60BM and PDPP4T:IEICO-4F, with comparisons to the stabilities of the individual components. We present direct evidence that specific molecular acceptor (fullerene vs nonfullerene) designs and the resulting donor-acceptor interactions lead to distinctly different mechanistic routes that ultimately arrive at what is termed ""OPV degradation."" We directly observe a chemical oxidation of the cyano endcaps of the IEICO-4F that coincides with a morphological change and large loss in photoconductivity while the fullerene acceptor-containing blend demonstrates a significantly greater fraction of oxygen uptake but retains 55% of the photoconductivity. This experimental roadmap provides meaningful guidance for future high-throughput, multimodal studies, benchmarking the sensitivity of the different analytical techniques for assessing stability in printable active layers, independent of complete device architectures."

In addition to high power conversion efficiency, stability under various environmental stresses is crucial for the application of ultrathin OPVs. In this study, the authors realize highly air‐stable and ultrathin (≈3 µm) OPVs that possess high efficiency (15.8%) and an outstanding power‐per‐weight ratio of 33.8 W g−1. Dynamic secondary‐ion mass spectrometry is used to identify Zn diffusion from the electron transport layer zinc oxide (ZnO) to the interface of photoactive layer; this diffusion results in the degradation of the ultrathin OPVs in air. The suppression of the Zn diffusion by a chelating strategy results in stable ultrathin OPVs that maintain 89.6% of their initial efficiency after storage for 1574 h in air at room temperature under dark conditions and 92.4% of their initial efficiency after annealing for 172 h at 85 °C in air under dark conditions. The lightweight and stable OPVs also possess excellent deformability with 87.3% retention of the initial performance after 5000 cycles of a compressing–stretching test with 33% compression."
25,10.1039/c9se00811j,2020.0,Thermal degradation related to the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and back electrode of the flexible inverted organic photovoltaic module,"The hole transport layer (HTL) and back electrode play a significant role in the stability of the flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) module. In particular, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), a widely used hole transport material, is known to be associated with many degrading factors in the OPV field. This study highlights the impact of the PEDOT:PSS layer on thermal stability using a thermal acceleration test of flexible OPV modules with the inverted structure of indium tin oxide/ZnO/photoactive layer/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. The results confirm that thermal degradation of the OPV devices depends on heat temperature, in which the OPV performance degrades by a notable decrease in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) as the temperature increases from 65 °C to 85 °C. Moreover, the stability of Voc is enhanced when the PEDOT:PSS layer is thicker and contains polar solvent DMSO as an additive, suggesting that the thermal degradation can correlate with the properties of the PEDOT:PSS layer. In addition, microscopy images of the active layers show that the surface damage is attributed to a residual solvent of the printed Ag electrode, thereby resulting in a thermally induced drop in the short circuit current density (Jsc). More detailed descriptions are presented in this paper, and the results are expected to offer a comprehensive understanding of the thermal degradation mechanism of OPV modules."
26,10.1039/C7EE02415K,2018.0,"Interpretation and evolution of open-circuit voltage, recombination, ideality factor and subgap defect states during reversible light-soaking and irreversible degradation of perovskite solar cells","Metal halide perovskite absorber materials are about to emerge as a high-efficiency photovoltaic technology. At the same time, they are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing characterized by a low energy input and abundant low-cost materials. However, a further optimization of their efficiency, stability and reliability demands a more detailed optoelectronic characterization and understanding of losses including their evolution with time. In this work, we analyze perovskite solar cells with different architectures (planar, mesoporous, HTL-free), employing temperature dependent measurements (current–voltage, light intensity, electroluminescence) of the ideality factor to identify dominating recombination processes that limit the open-circuit voltage (Voc). We find that in thoroughly-optimized, high-Voc (≈1.2 V) devices recombination prevails through defects in the perovskite. On the other hand, irreversible degradation at elevated temperature is caused by the introduction of broad tail states originating from an external source (e.g. metal electrode). Light-soaking is another effect decreasing performance, though reversibly. Based on FTPS measurements, this degradation is attributed to the generation of surface defects becoming a new source of non-radiative recombination. We conclude that improving long-term stability needs to focus on adjacent layers, whereas a further optimization of efficiency of top-performing devices requires understanding of the defect physics of the nanocrystalline perovskite absorber. Finally, our work provides guidelines for the design of further dedicated studies to correctly interpret the diode ideality factor and decrease recombination losses."
27,10.1149/ma2023-02482429mtgabs,2023.0,Activity and Stability of High-Surface-Area Nickel-Based Catalysts for the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Under Industrially Relevant Conditions,"Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is at a stage of high technological maturity, and modern pressurized designs have mitigated the weaknesses of now-outdated atmospheric electrolyzers. For instance, pressurized systems now deliver high hydrogen outputs and can efficiently adjust to rapid changes in power loads. These improvements were, in part, made possible through significant reductions to internal ohmic losses coming from improved gas separators, shorter distances between electrodes, and increased operating temperatures.
 From an industrial point of view, the critical parameter to optimize is the full stack voltage. The stack voltage is tightly bound to the individual cell voltage and can thus be lowered by employing more efficient electrocatalysts. However, reducing the cell voltage by raising the temperature of operation—thereby improving both reaction kinetics and the conductivity of the KOH electrolyte—can be of similar or even higher importance (e.g., ca. 4.5 mV/˚C, Figure 1) [1]. Therefore, stability under operation at elevated temperatures must be considered when evaluating novel hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for AWE. Else, a novel catalyst risks becoming the bottleneck in the pursuit of higher operating temperatures, limiting its applicability for large-scale electrolysis [2]. Many assessments of novel AWE catalysts are still carried out at room temperature in diluted electrolytes and at low current densities [3]. In the harsher conditions of an electrolyzer, catalysts experience higher dissolution rates and are subject to higher mechanical stress from, for instance, the aggressive bubble evolution. This gap hinders the transfer of catalyst developments from academia to industrial research laboratories and, ultimately, to practical applications.
 In this work, we attempted to narrow that gap by conducting electrochemical measurements under more application-oriented conditions (i.e., 80-120 °C and 8-11 M KOH). We evaluated the HER activity and the robustness of high-surface-area electrodes produced through controlled leaching of bimetallic nickel-based alloys. A parametric study of the overpotential and robustness as a function of electrochemically active surface area was enabled by varying the synthesis parameters of a Raney-type preparation. Direct coupling to renewable energy sources requires the electrolyzer to frequently and rapidly shut off and on. This intermittent operation induces additional stress on the electrodes as the catalysts transition through different redox states, which is often overlooked in AWE electrocatalyst research. To track redox, compositional, and morphological changes, we used ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy. At the same time, the dissolution and redeposition of ionic species were monitored using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. By matching the characterization data with the evolution of the overpotential until complete deactivation, we gained an understanding of the degradation mechanisms in high-surface-area nickel-based electrodes. These results shed light on the challenges and prospects of this promising class of electrocatalysts for alkaline HER under industrial conditions.

28,10.3390/pharmaceutics14091967,2022.0,Stability Study of Alpinia galanga Constituents and Investigation of Their Membrane Permeability by ChemGPS-NP and the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay,"Alpinia galanga Willd., greater galangal, has been used for thousands of years as a spice as well as in traditional medicine. Its central nervous system (CNS) stimulant activity and neuroprotective effects have been proved both in animal models and human trials. However, the compounds responsible for these effects have not been identified yet. Therefore, the main constituents (p-OH-benzaldehyde (1), trans-p-coumaryl-alcohol (2), p-coumaryl-aldehyde (4), galanganol A (5), galanganol B (6), trans-p-acetoxycinnamyl alcohol (7), 1′S-1′-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA, 9), and 1′S-1′-acetoxyeugenol acetate (AEA, 10)) were isolated to investigate their aqueous stability and passive diffusion across the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) membrane and the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA). Our positive results for compounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 10 suggest good permeability, thus potential contribution to the effects of greater galangal in the CNS. The results of the PAMPA-BBB were corroborated by in silico chemography-based ChemGPS-NP framework experiments. In addition, examination of the chemical space position of galangal compounds in relation to known psychostimulants revealed that all the molecules in proximity are NET/SERT inhibitors. As ACA and AEA did not show much proximity to either compound, the importance of further investigation of their degradation products becomes more pronounced."

It is well known that light exposure induces color changes in MoO3 (photochromism) and the formation of intermolecular bonds between C60 molecules (photopolymerization). The influence of these photoinduced reactions on the long‐term stability of OPV cells, however, has not previously been studied in detail. Here, a study and discussion of the early (<5 days) aging mechanisms occurring in illuminated ITO/MoO3/organic cyanine dye/C60/Alq3/Ag bilayer solar cells under nitrogen atmosphere is presented. A degradation process at the organic heterojunction is identified and the formation of Mo5+ species during illumination is found to adversely affect cell behavior. For these widely used materials, the results suggest that light processing is a first necessary step before OPV characteristics can be meaningfully rated."
30,10.1021/acsami.5b03970,2015.0,Enhanced Stability of Aluminum Nanoparticle-Doped Organic Solar Cells.,"Enhancement of the stability of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is reported by the addition of surfactant-free aluminum (Al) nanoparticles (NPs) into the photoactive layer. The universality of the effect is demonstrated for two different BHJ systems, namely, the well-studied poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as well as the high efficient poly[N-9'-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole)]:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC71BM). It is shown that the lifetime of the devices with Al NPs, operating under continuous one-sun illumination in ambient conditions, is more than three times longer compared to the reference devices. Using complementary analytical techniques for in situ studies, we have explored the underlying mechanisms behind the observed stability improvement in the case of the P3HT:PCBM system. In particular, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), photoluminescence decay and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy experiments were performed and complemented with device degradation electrical measurements. It is found that the embedded Al NPs act as performance stabilizers, giving rise to enhanced structural stability of the active blend. Furthermore, it is revealed that the observed improvement can also be ascribed to NP-mediated mitigation of the photo-oxidation effect. This study addresses a major issue in OPV devices, that is, photoinduced stability, indicating that the exploitation of Al NPs could be a successful approach toward fabricating OPVs exhibiting long-term operating lifetimes."
31,10.1002/smll.202305437,2023.0,Ultra-Stable ITO-Free Organic Solar Cells and Modules Processed from Non-Halogenated Solvents under Indoor Illumination.,"Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) is a very promising technology to harvest artificial illumination and power smart devices of the Internet of Things (IoT). Efficiencies as high as 30.2% have been reported for OPVs under warm white light-emitting diode (LED) light. This is due to the narrow spectrum of indoor light, which leads to an optimal bandgap of ≈1.9 eV. Under full sunlight, OPV devices often suffer from poor stability compared to the established inorganic PV technologies such as crystalline silicon. This study focuses on a potentially very cost-effective Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) free cell stack with absorber materials processed from non-halogenated solvents. These organic solar cells and modules with efficiencies up to 21% can already achieve remarkable stabilities under typical indoor illumination. Aging under 50,000 lux LED lighting leads to very little degradation after more than 11 000 h. This light dose corresponds to more than 110 years under 500 lux. For modules encapsulated with a flexible barrier, extrapolated lifetimes of more than 41 years are achieved. This shows that OPV is mature for the specific application under indoor illumination. Due to the large number of potential organic semiconducting materials, further efficiency increase can be expected."
32,10.1002/pip.3791,2024.0,Long‐term outdoor study of an organic photovoltaic module for building integration,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising alternative to silicon wafer‐based technologies for building integration. While significant progress has been achieved on the power conversion efficiency of OPV technologies, their field stability is rarely studied. This work investigates the field performance and reliability of a large‐area OPV module designed for building integration in tropical Singapore for 4.5 years. The device suffered more than 14% degradation in power at the standard testing conditions from the initial performance, largely due to losses in fill factor (−12% relative). During the monitoring period, it exhibited comparable performance to more conventional silicon PV technologies, with an average specific energy yield of about 4 kWh/kWp/day and an average performance ratio of 0.96. Excellent performance at low light conditions was also observed. However, its field performance was heavily impacted by soiling, which typically led to a 5 to 10% loss in the current output after several months. Further, the device's outdoor performance also showed a three‐stage degradation process, including (1) an initial slow degradation in the first 2 years (about −1%/year), (2) a stable period with negligible performance loss from Years 2 to 3.5, and (3) a rapid degradation in the last year (about −5%/year)."
33,10.1101/2020.06.11.20128884,2020.0,Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on critical personal protective equipment,"The spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings is concerning, with healthcare workers representing a disproportionately high percentage of confirmed cases. Although SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to persist on surfaces for a number of days, the extent and duration of fomites as a mode of transmission, particularly in healthcare settings, has not been fully characterized. To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable by TCID 50 assay within 24 h. These findings underline the importance of appropriate handling of contaminated PPE during and following use in high-risk settings and provide interesting insight into the potential utility of cotton in limiting COVID-19 transmission."

Recent breakthroughs attained by development of nonfullerene acceptors result in significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCEs) exceeding 17%. However, most of researches have focused on pursuing high efficiency of small‐area (<1 cm2) unit cells fabricated usually with spin coating. For practical application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) from lab‐scale unit cells to industrial products, it is essential to develop efficient technologies that can extend active area of devices with minimized loss of performance and ensured operational stability. In this progress report, an overview of recent advancements in materials and processing technologies is provided for transitioning from small‐area laboratory‐scale devices to large‐area industrial scale modules. First, development of materials that satisfy requirements of high tolerability in active layer thickness and large‐area adaptability is introduced. Second, morphology control using various coating techniques in a large active area is discussed. Third, the recent research progress is also underlined for understanding mechanisms of OPV degradation and studies for improving device long‐term stability along with reliable evaluation procedures."
35,10.1021/acsami.7b01183,2017.0,Influence of the Hole Transporting Layer on the Thermal Stability of Inverted Organic Photovoltaics Using Accelerated-Heat Lifetime Protocols,"High power conversion efficiency (PCE) inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) usually use thermally evaporated MoO3 as a hole transporting layer (HTL). Despite the high PCE values reported, stability investigations are still limited and the exact degradation mechanisms of inverted OPVs using thermally evaporated MoO3 HTL remain unclear under different environmental stress factors. In this study, we monitor the accelerated lifetime performance under the ISOS-D-2 protocol (heat conditions 65 °C) of nonencapsulated inverted OPVs based on the thiophene-based active layer materials poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPPTTT) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC[70]BM). The presented investigation of degradation mechanisms focus on optimized P3HT:PC[70]BM-based inverted OPVs. Specifically, we present a systematic study on the thermal stability of inverted P3HT:PC[70]BM OPVs using solution-processed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and evaporated MoO3 HTL. Using a series of measurements and reverse engineering methods, we report that the P3HT:PC[70]BM/MoO3 interface is the main origin of failure of the P3HT:PC[70]BM-based inverted OPVs under intense heat conditions, a trend that is also observed for the other two thiophene-based polymers used in this study."
36,10.1002/aenm.201401912,2015.0,The Critical Choice of PEDOT:PSS Additives for Long Term Stability of Roll‐to‐Roll Processed OPVs,"The impact of additives mixed with poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) on the stability of organic photovoltaic modules is investigated for fully ambient roll‐to‐roll (R2R) processed indium tin oxide free modules. Four different PEDOT:PSS inks from two different suppliers are used. The modules are manufactured directly on barrier foil without a UV filter to accelerate degradation and enable completion of the study in a reasonable time span. The modules are subjected to stability testing following well‐established protocols developed by the international summit on organic photovoltaic stability (ISOS). For the harsh indoor test (ISOS‐L‐3) only a slight difference in stability is observed between the different modules. During both ISOS‐L‐3 and ISOS‐D‐3 one new failure mode is observed as a result of tiny air inclusions in the barrier foil and a R2R method is developed to detect and quantify these. During outdoor operation (ISOS‐O‐1) the use of ethylene glycol (EG) as an additive is found to drastically increase the operational stability of the modules as compared to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and a new failure mode specific to modules with DMSO as the additive is identified. The data are extended in an ongoing experiment where DMSO is used as additive for long‐term outdoor testing in a solar park."
37,10.3390/molecules26102874,2021.0,Stability Enhancement of a Dimeric HER2-Specific Affibody Molecule through Sortase A-Catalyzed Head-to-Tail Cyclization,"Natural backbone-cyclized proteins have an increased thermostability and resistance towards proteases, characteristics that have sparked interest in head-to-tail cyclization as a method to stability-enhance proteins used in diagnostics and therapeutic applications, for example. In this proof-of principle study, we have produced and investigated a head-to-tail cyclized and HER2-specific ZHER2:342 Affibody dimer. The sortase A-mediated cyclization reaction is highly efficient (>95%) under optimized conditions, and renders a cyclic ZHER3:342-dimer with an apparent melting temperature, Tm, of 68 °C, which is 3 °C higher than that of its linear counterpart. Circular dichroism spectra of the linear and cyclic dimers looked very similar in the far-UV range, both before and after thermal unfolding to 90 °C, which suggests that cyclization does not negatively impact the helicity or folding of the cyclic protein. The cyclic dimer had an apparent sub-nanomolar affinity (Kd ~750 pM) to the HER2-receptor, which is a ~150-fold reduction in affinity relative to the linear dimer (Kd ~5 pM), but the anti-HER2 Affibody dimer remained a high-affinity binder even after cyclization. No apparent difference in proteolytic stability was detected in an endopeptidase degradation assay for the cyclic and linear dimers. In contrast, in an exopeptidase degradation assay, the linear dimer was shown to be completely degraded after 5 min, while the cyclic dimer showed no detectable degradation even after 60 min. We further demonstrate that a site-specifically DyLight 594-labeled cyclic dimer shows specific binding to HER2-overexpressing cells. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that head-to-tail cyclization can be an effective strategy to increase the stability of an Affibody dimer."
38,10.12973/EJAC.2017.00152A,2016.0,A New Stability-Indicating and Validated RP-HPLC Method for the Estimation of Liraglutide in Bulk and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms,"A stability-indicating RP-HPLC method was developed and validated for the estimation of Liraglutide in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage forms. Shiseido C18 (250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D., 5 μm particle size) column was used as stationary phase with mobile phase consisting methanol+acetonitrile (80:20): phosphate buffer (pH 3.0 adjusted with ortho phosphoric acid) in the ratio of 75:25, v/v. The flow rate was maintained at 1.2 ml/min and effluents were monitored at 245 nm. The retention time was found to be 2.837 minutes. The forced degradation studies were performed as per ICH guidelines under acidic, alkali, oxidative, thermal, photostability and neutral conditions. The drug peak was well resolved from the peaks of degraded products. From the degradation studies it is evident that the drug showed instability under acidic, alkali, oxidative, thermal, photostability and neutral conditions. The linearity of the method was observed in the concentration range of 10-60 μg/ml with the number of theoretical plates & tailing factor being 5550 & 1.17 respectively with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. The percentage assay of Liraglutide was found to be 99.66%. The method was validated for its accuracy, precision and system suitability. The results obtained in the study were within the limits of ICH guidelines and hence this method can be used for the estimation of Liraglutide in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage forms."
39,10.1002/aenm.202101383,2021.0,A Review on Emerging Barrier Materials and Encapsulation Strategies for Flexible Perovskite and Organic Photovoltaics,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have undergone rapid development within the last decade, exhibiting exciting properties such as high efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for large‐scale fabrication through roll‐to‐roll (R2R) processing. Despite this, operational stability is recognized to be an ongoing challenge as prolonged device lifetimes are scarcely observed. This instability can be narrowed down to both “intrinsic degradation” and “extrinsic degradation,” with exposure to moisture and oxygen having detrimental effects on device performance. A means of delaying the degradation of flexible PSC and OPV devices is through barrier encapsulation. Despite glass encapsulation exhibiting ideal barrier properties, the potential for flexible devices and high‐throughput R2R fabrication requires the development of flexible barrier materials and encapsulation strategies. These barriers must demonstrate outstanding moisture permeation resistance, high transparency, chemical and thermal stability, and must be able to withstand repeated mechanical deformation. Herein, the fundamental principles of PSC and OPV devices are initially discussed, highlighting the degradation mechanisms and current stability obstacles. A review of the latest flexible barrier materials and encapsulation strategies follows, introducing stability studies that have been undertaken on flexible PSCs and OPV, along with suggestions as to the direction that future research may take."
40,10.1039/c2nr32799f,2012.0,Enhancement of photo/thermal stability of organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices via gold nanoparticles doping of the active layer.,"This study focuses on the crucial problem of the stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, aiming to shed light on the photo and thermal degradation mechanisms during prolonged irradiation under ambient conditions. For this purpose, the stability enhancement of bulk heterojunction OPV devices upon embedding surfactant free Au nanoparticles (NPs) into the photoactive layer is investigated by in situ time-resolved energy dispersive X-ray reflectometry (EDXR), photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy as well as device degradation electrical measurements. It is shown that besides the improved cell efficiency attributed to plasmon absorption and scattering effects, the embedded NPs act as performance stabilizers, giving rise to enhanced structural stability and, in turn, to reduced photodegradation rate of the respective OPV devices. It is particularly clarified that, in addition to further stabilization of the polymer-fullerene blend, the observed improvement can be ascribed to a NP-mediated mitigation of the photooxidation effect at the cathode-active layer interface. Our work suggests the exploitation of surfactant free NPs to be a successful approach to address aging effects in OPV devices."
41,10.1051/e3sconf/202454701021,2024.0,Sustainable Energy Conversion via Organic Photovoltaics: Material Selection and Evaluation,"The lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective features of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) makes them a promising candidate for the development of a sustainable energy conversion technology. In this study, we investigate the process of selecting and evaluating organic materials for use in OPV applications, with a particular emphasis on improving both efficiency and stability. In this study, the most important results are highlighted by means of a complete literature review and data analysis. Bandgaps, HOMO levels, and LUMO levels are all features of the material that play a significant role in determining the performance of the device. Bandgaps may have values ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 eV, while HOMO levels can have values ranging from -5.5 to -4.8 eV. Efficiency enhancement initiatives, such as the invention of new donor- acceptor polymers and non-fullerene acceptors, have resulted to gains in power conversion efficiency (PCE), with values reaching 15%. These benefits have been achieved via the implementation of these tactics. Due to the fact that degradation processes have an effect on the performance of the device over time, stability concerns are very important for practical deployment. In order to improve the device's stability, encapsulation materials and stabilizing chemicals are used to reduce the number of breakdown routes. This paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in OPV technology by highlighting the significance of material selection, efficiency enhancement, and stability improvement for sustainable energy conversion. Performance evaluation metrics, such as fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc), indicate improved device performance. FF ranges from 60% to 70%, and Voc ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 V. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge. The optimization of materials and device designs should be the primary focus of future research efforts in order to significantly improve the performance of OPVs and speed up its deployment as a viable renewable energy alternative."
42,10.1089/ars.2010.3458,2011.0,Improving the stability of α-conotoxin AuIB through N-to-C cyclization: the effect of linker length on stability and activity at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.,"Modification of α-conotoxin frameworks through cyclization via an oligopeptide linker has previously been shown as an effective strategy for improving in vivo stability. We have extended this strategy by investigating cyclic analogs of α-conotoxin AuIB, a selective α(3)β(4) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, to examine a range of oligopeptide linker lengths on the oxidative formation of disulfide bonds, activity at nAChRs, and stability to degradation by chymotrypsin. Upon nondirected random oxidation, the ribbon isomer formed preferentially with the globular isomer occurring as a minor by-product. Therefore, a regioselective disulfide bond forming strategy was used to prepare the cAuIB-2 globular isomer in high yield and purity. The cAuIB-2 globular isomer exhibited a threefold decrease in activity for the α(3)β(4) nAChR compared to wild-type-AuIB, although it was selective for α(3)β(4) over α(7) and α(4)β(2) subtypes. On the other hand, the cAuIB-2 ribbon isomer was shown to be inactive at all three nAChR subtypes. Nonetheless, all of the cyclic analogs were found to be significantly more stable to degradation by chymotrypsin than wild-type AuIB. As such, the cAuIB-2 globular isomer could constitute a useful probe for studying the role of the α(3)β(4) nAChR in a range of in vivo experimental paradigms."

In this work, we apply the Incident Photon-to-Electron Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) and the in situ IPCE techniques to determine the relation between solar cell performance and solar cell stability. Different ageing conditions were considered: accelerated full sun simulation, low level indoor fluorescent lighting and dark storage. The devices were also monitored under conditions of ambient and inert (N(2)) atmospheres, which allows for the identification of the solar cell materials more susceptible to degradation by ambient air (oxygen and moisture). The different OPVs configurations permitted the study of the intrinsic stability of the devices depending on: two different ITO-replacement alternatives, two different hole extraction layers (PEDOT:PSS and MoO(3)), and two different P3HT-based polymers. The response of un-encapsulated devices to ambient atmosphere offered insight into the importance of moisture in solar cell performance. Our results demonstrate that the IPCE and the in situ IPCE techniques are valuable analytical methods to understand device degradation and solar cell lifetime."
44,,2019.0,Performance and stability of semitransparent OPVs for building,"9 Semitransparent (ST) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are demonstrating great potential 10 for building integration applications, especially in windows. For that purpose, ST-OPVs 11 should achieve adequate transparency and performance stability. In this regard, the 12 present research deals with the experimental performance of three different building13 integrated ST-OPV technologies (technology A: developed in the frame of the present 14 study; technologies B and C: commercial modules). More specifically, spectral 15 transmittance and electrical measurements have been conducted in order to determine 16 the characteristics of the modules for building integration and electricity generation 17 purposes. Results regarding the transmittance reveal that technology A outperforms 18 technologies B and C. The stability analysis of the modules verifies that module C is the 19 most stable one with almost no decrease (3.6%) in the power conversion efficiency 20 (PCE). Furthermore, the PCE of technology B is slightly higher than in the case of 21 technology C, which experiences a PCE degradation of about 10-15% over the whole 22 time period. Finally, technology A presents a 20% reduction in PCE at around 500 23 hours. 24"
45,10.1557/jmr.2018.239,2018.0,The path to ubiquitous organic electronics hinges on its stability,"In the year 2004, a revealing review by Stephen Forrest pointed to how organic electronics could shake up the conventional semiconductor industry by exploring the fact that organic semiconductors, in principle, could be processed on inexpensive plastic substrates of virtually any shape from solution or gas phase using high throughput methods. One of the key challenges identified was the successful translation from the proofof-concept using lab-scale approaches to large-area appliances. This would require a high degree of innovation to achieve ultra low-cost fabrication methodologies, compatible with industrial standards. Since then, the processing of organic semiconductors through printing and coating techniques to realize life size device fabrication has developed rapidly, to the extent that organic light emitting diodes (OLED), organic field effect transistors (OFET), and organic photovoltaics (OPV) advanced from a lab curiosity to commercialized mainstream technologies, mainly in the form of displays and, partially, solar modules. Today, organic printed electronics are evolving towards smart, highly functional sensors, monitoring temperature, pressure, optical signals, and even physiological parameters. An extension of this development is the emerging interest in the integration of organic semiconductors into imperceptible electronics, soft machines, and detectors of neurological activity. This is possible because organic devices can now be processed onto ultrathin (;1lm), ultra-flexible and stretchable substrates, allowing electronics to seemingly conform to three-dimensional shapes and biological tissue. These are obviously very exciting developments, where interfacing organic electronics with biological material brings about its own technological challenges. Still, a common, often underestimated, problem for early and advanced applications of organic electronics is the device stability with respect to environmental contaminants – mainly oxygen and moisture – light, and mechanical stress. From the more established organic electronics technologies such as OLED and OPV, it is well known that packaging costs typically dominate the overall production cost because the performance of these types of devices quickly deteriorates when the permeation of moisture and oxygen exceeds 10 g/m-2/day and 10 cm3/m2/day/bar, respectively. To date, long operation times rely on costly, high barrier materials. This imposes significant economic burdens on the costs of a final product and limits the ubiquitous adoption of organic electronics. Thus, in order to take full advantage of the low-cost factor of mass-printed organic electronics it is critically important to adopt inexpensive packaging materials with limited oxygen and moisture barrier properties, similar to what is used in the food industry. Some of the emanating technologies described previously may even preclude the use of any barrier. Consequently, conceptually new strategies are necessary for the stabilization of organic electronic materials and devices. This was the driving challenge to be addressed in this Focus Issue. The reasons for the instability of organic electronics are truly manifold and often system specific. The latter adds additional complexity and makes a universal solution unlikely. Importantly, identifying the underlying degradation mechanism is a tedious, yet essential, process towards a complete understanding and problem solving. This is reflected in the present Focus Issue, which explores an interesting combination of ideas, covering material strategies, device engineering, characterization techniques, and engineering of barriers, while envisioning future applications. For instance, the group of Jean Manca analyzed the requirements for a successful implementation of organic solar cells for space application during a stratospheric balloon flight. OPV has been long foreseen as a very interesting technology for space applications due to its very high power output per unit weight. Yet, this is the first study of its kind.

46,10.1039/c2cp41787a,2012.0,TOF-SIMS investigation of degradation pathways occurring in a variety of organic photovoltaic devices--the ISOS-3 inter-laboratory collaboration.,"The present work is the fourth (and final) contribution to an inter-laboratory collaboration that was planned at the 3rd International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS-3). The collaboration involved six laboratories capable of producing seven distinct sets of OPV devices that were degraded under well-defined conditions in accordance with the ISOS-3 protocols. The degradation experiments lasted up to 1830 hours and involved more than 300 cells on more than 100 devices. The devices were analyzed and characterized at different points of their lifetimes by a large number of non-destructive and destructive techniques in order to identify specific degradation mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of the photovoltaic response. Work presented herein involves time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in order to study chemical degradation in-plane as well as in-depth in the organic solar cells. Various degradation mechanisms were investigated and correlated with cell performance. For example, photo-oxidation of the active material was quantitatively studied as a function of cell performance. The large variety of cell architectures used (some with and some without encapsulation) enabled valuable comparisons and important conclusions to be drawn on degradation behaviour. This comprehensive investigation of OPV stability has significantly advanced the understanding of degradation behaviour in OPV devices, which is an important step towards large scale application of organic solar cells."
47,10.1039/C5RA24010G,2015.0,Stability enhancement of organic photovoltaic devices utilizing partially reduced graphene oxide as the hole transport layer: nanoscale insight into structural/interfacial properties and aging effects,"A powerful insight into the structural and interfacial properties of post-fabricated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is reported. The nanoscale local structure of integrated devices is revealed by combined X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF) investigations. A comparative study is performed on devices using graphene oxide (GO) as the hole transporting layer (HTL) and reference PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) devices. Spatially resolved simultaneous XRD/XRF measurements with nanometre resolution on pristine and aged states of the devices evidence the occurrence of morphological modifications in the poly(2,7-carbazole) derivative (PCDTBT):fullerene derivative (PC71BM) active layer, induced by thermal reduction and solar illumination. Additionally, the results indicate that OPV devices with partially reduced graphene oxide (pr-GO) used as the HTL, exhibit photovoltaic characteristics similar to the PEDOT:PSS based devices but with a significant durability enhancement. This is attributed to the protecting role of the pr-GO film against humidity and indium diffusion from the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) anode into the photoactive layer. As a result, the devices fabricated with pr-GO-HTL retain approximately 65% of their initial power conversion efficiency over 20 hours, while the efficiency of the reference devices degrades to 45% of the initial value."

The imatinib mesilate has five specified impurities and can be easily determined using this methodology. All impurities and imatinib peak are resolved using XB ridge C18, 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm column.

The method has been validated as per ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines. Forced degradation study is performed using this method and proved that the method is stability-indicating and suitable for use."
49,10.2139/ssrn.4266271,2022.0,Long-Term Outdoor Study of Organic Photovoltaics for Building Integration,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) has attracted tremendous attention as a promising alternative to silicon wafer-based technologies for building integration. While signiﬁcant progress has been achieved on the power conversion eﬃciency of OPV technologies, their ﬁeld stability is rarely studied. This work investigates the ﬁeld performance and reliability of a large-area OPV module designed for BIPV application in the tropical region of Singapore for 4.5 years. The device suﬀered more than 14% degradation in power at the standard testing conditions from the initial performance, largely due to losses in ﬁll factor (-12% relative). During the monitoring period, it exhibited comparable performance to more conventional silicon PV technologies, with an average speciﬁc energy yield of about 4 kWh/kWp/day and an average performance ratio of 0.96. Excellent performance at low light conditions was also observed. However, its ﬁeld performance was heavily impacted by soiling, which typically led to a 5 to 10% loss in the current output after several months. Further, the device’s outdoor performance also showed a three-stage degradation process, including (1) an initial slow degradation in the ﬁrst two years (about -1%/year), (2) a stable period with negligible performance loss from year 2 to year 3.5 and (3) a rapid degradation in the last year (about -5%/year)."

The molecules were designed aiming at tuning their HOMO−LUMO levels without remarkably changing their optical properties. The syntheses were carried out through a convergent−divergent approach by reaction of a 7,7‘-diiodobifluorene building block with 2-fluoren-7-yl-ethynyl (BF1), 2-carbazol-3-yl-ethynyl (BF2), 2-fluoren-7-yl-ethenyl (BF3), and 2-carbazol-3-yl-ethenyl (BF4) moieties. The analysis of the optical properties evidenced for BF1−4 an efficient blue emission in solution. Their emission profile is preserved also in the solid state, except for that of BF4, the PL spectrum of which showed the appearance of a green band deriving from aerobic degradation. The HOMO value of −5.00 eV, measured for BF4 by cyclic voltammetry, suggested a correlation of the spectral instability with its low ionization potential. This hypothesis was confirmed by ..."
51,10.1002/aenm.202104018,2022.0,"Charge‐Selective, Narrow‐Gap Indium Arsenide Quantum Dot Layer for Highly Stable and Efficient Organic Photovoltaics","The past decade has seen a dramatic surge in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of next‐generation solution‐processed thin‐film solar cells rapidly closing the gap in PCE of commercially‐available photovoltaic (PV) cells. Yet the operational stability of such new PVs leaves a lot to be desired. Specifically, chemical reaction with absorbers via high‐energy photons transmitted through the typically‐adapted metal oxide electron transporting layers (ETLs), and photocatalytic degradation at interfaces are considered detrimental to the device performance. Herein, the authors introduce a device architecture using the narrow‐gap, Indium Arsenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) with discrete electronic states as an ETL in high‐efficiency solution‐processed PVs. High‐performing PM6:Y6 organic PVs (OPVs) achieve a PCE of 15.1%. More importantly, as the operating stability of the device is significantly improved, retaining above 80% of the original PCE over 1000 min under continuous illumination, a Newport‐certified PCE of 13.1% is reported for nonencapsulated OPVs measured under ambient air. Based on operando studies as well as optical simulations, it suggested that the InAs CQD ETLs with discrete energy states effectively cut‐off high‐energy photons while selectively collecting electrons from the absorber. The findings of this works enable high‐efficiency solution‐processed PVs with enhanced durability under operating conditions."
52,10.3390/ijms18010164,2017.0,Comparative Solid-State Stability of Perindopril Active Substance vs. Pharmaceutical Formulation,"This paper presents the results obtained after studying the thermal stability and decomposition kinetics of perindopril erbumine as a pure active pharmaceutical ingredient as well as a solid pharmaceutical formulation containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Since no data were found in the literature regarding the spectroscopic description, thermal behavior, or decomposition kinetics of perindopril, our goal was the evaluation of the compatibility of this antihypertensive agent with the excipients in the tablet under ambient conditions and to study the effect of thermal treatment on the stability of perindopril erbumine. ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, thermal analysis (thermogravimetric mass curve (TG—thermogravimetry), derivative thermogravimetric mass curve (DTG), and heat flow (HF)) and model-free kinetics were chosen as investigational tools. Since thermal behavior is a simplistic approach in evaluating the thermal stability of pharmaceuticals, in-depth kinetic studies were carried out by classical kinetic methods (Kissinger and ASTM E698) and later with the isoconversional methods of Friedman, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa. It was shown that the main thermal degradation step of perindopril erbumine is characterized by activation energy between 59 and 69 kJ/mol (depending on the method used), while for the tablet, the values were around 170 kJ/mol. The used excipients (anhydrous colloidal silica, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, and magnesium stearate) should be used in newly-developed generic solid pharmaceutical formulations, since they contribute to an increased thermal stability of perindopril erbumine."
53,,2018.0,"Photo-degradation, thermal degradation and storage: the impact of the organic solar cell architecture on the degradation mechanisms","Understanding the degradation mechanisms in organic photovoltaics is a major issue in order to develop stable organic semi-conductors and robust device architectures. We investigated the role of the architecture of organic solar cells (OSC) in the stability of the device under different aging conditions. 
The impact of the light, especially the UV part of the solar spectrum, on the evolution of the photovoltaic characteristics of the inverted OSC devices was investigated. The results show that UV light induces an important Voc loss for several active layers. More importantly, we show that the type of electron transport layer (ETL) induces different degradation mechanisms. For TiOx-based devices, the formation of an interface dipole was identified, resulting in a loss of the flat-band potential (Vfb). For ZnO-based devices, chemical modifications of the metal oxide and active layer at the interface were detected, resulting in a doping of the active layer. 
The stability of inverted OSC under thermal stress was also investigated and the role played by the hole transport layer (HTL) material and metal electrode was examined. A roughening phenomenon of the silver electrode was detected upon thermal ageing. For sufficiently thick silver layers, this has no impact of the device stability. However, for devices with thin silver electrode, this de-wetting phenomenon leads to a complete failure of the solar cell due to the formation of gaps in the electrode. This problem can be overcome with the addition of a thin metal-oxide layer on top of the electrode. Using XPS depth profile, we also demonstrated the presence of inter-layer diffusion when silver is used as an electrode material. This inter-diffusion is correlated to declines in the performance of the device when used in conjunction with MoO3 as an HTL. 
The stability under storage in air of OSC in direct architecture was also investigated and we developed a novel strategy to replace the PEDOT:PSS. A poly(3-hexylthiophene) bearing a triethoxysilane function at the end of the chain (P3HT-Si) was anchored to the indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The use of this novel grafted HTL creates a hole selective membrane which drastically reduces the leakage current. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of OSC was improved compared to devices with bare ITO. By replacing PEDOT:PSS by the hydrophobic P3HT-Si, the water penetration in the device is impeded which significantly improved the shelf lifetime of devices. 
These different studies highlight the role of the architecture and, more specifically, of the ETL, HTL and electrode in the stability of OPV devices."
54,,2018.0,Degradation and outdoor performance monitoring of next generation solar cells for building integrated applications,"This thesis focuses on the manufacturing, indoor characterisation and outdoor monitoring of Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and Organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In order for emerging PV technologies to become commercially viable it is important that their performance under these conditions is defined. 
In this thesis, the outdoor performance parameters of PSCs and OPVs monitored over the course of several campaigns are reported and benchmarked against polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) solar cells. The data has been analysed in detail against solar irradiance dose, climatic conditions and stability. It was discovered that in common with poly-Si PVs, PSCs also exhibits a distinctive negative temperature coefficient across all performance parameters (VOC, ISC, FF and PCE) which decreases with increasing irradiation dose. In all outdoor campaigns the main causes for early-life degradation were noted to be sealant failure leading to oxygen and water ingress, although longer-term degradation has been observed and assigned to photo-oxidation which in some cases was effectively suppressed by the utilisation of UV filtering. 
The stability of PSCs and active layers was improved by the use of luminescent down-shifting coatings which were applied as a substitute to conventional UV filters. 
This thesis also demonstrates the benefit of multidirectional orientation of OPVs laminated onto an industrial building prototype for building-integrated applications. It is shown that positioning OPVs to more directions than South improves the overall diurnal yield and can potentially double the energy produced per year, in particular for peak generation hours in the UK. 
The benefit of unreacted lead iodide as partial filter to the highly damaging UV component of sunlight is shown. The importance of a thin residue lead iodide layer in PSCs shows an improvement in the stability of fabricated devices. 
One of the most significant findings in this thesis is the first report on the stability of perovskite absorber layers and solar cells conducted with irradiance levels at 1sun or 100sun concentrated natural sunlight. By accelerating the aging process, this method provides invaluable information about the long-term performance of absorber layers and devices which is an immense contribution to the PV community in improving the compositions and structure of PSCs. 
Abstract

The stability of 3rd generation PV remains a critical issue preventing the appearance of these new and exciting, flexible and highly efficient PVs on the market. The last part of this thesis shows the second important finding in this thesis which focuses on an in-depth study of the stability of OPVs subjected to a multi-stress accelerated lifetime testing (ALT). This study is conducted indoors which facilitates the most destructive elements to the life of an OPV exposed outdoors to be clearly determined by exposing the modules to well-defined exposure conditions."
55,10.1039/D0EE03885G,2021.0,Photogeneration and the bulk quantum efficiency of organic photovoltaics,"We introduce a method to analyze the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) by calculating its “bulk quantum efficiency” (BQE), a quantity related to the recombination losses within the BHJ, but not in the surrounding device layers. By applying the method to both vacuum- and solution-processed OPVs with various BHJ, buffer layers and interface layer compositions, we show that measurements of the BQE isolates the properties of the BHJ from other device layers and interfaces. We use measurements of the BQE to study various mechanisms in OPV degradation and find that for solution-processed OPVs with a ZnO cathode buffer layer, the BHJ undergoes degradation due primarily to the ZnO. By inserting a self-assembled monolayer at the interface between the buffer and the BHJ, the stability of the OPV is significantly improved."
56,10.1002/aenm.201901829,2019.0,Study of Burn‐In Loss in Green Solvent‐Processed Ternary Blended Organic Photovoltaics Derived from UV‐Crosslinkable Semiconducting Polymers and Nonfullerene Acceptors,"This work deals with the investigation of burn‐in loss in ternary blended organic photovoltaics (OPVs) prepared from a UV‐crosslinkable semiconducting polymer (P2FBTT‐Br) and a nonfullerene acceptor (IEICO‐4F) via a green solvent process. The synthesized P2FBTT‐Br can be crosslinked by UV irradiation for 150 s and dissolved in 2‐methylanisole due to its asymmetric structure. In OPV performance and burn‐in loss tests performed at 75 °C or AM 1.5G Sun illumination for 90 h, UV‐crosslinked devices with PC71BM show 9.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability against burn‐in loss than pristine devices. The frozen morphology resulting from the crosslinking prevents lateral crystallization and aggregation related to morphological degradation. When IEICO‐4F is introduced in place of a fullerene‐based acceptor, the burn‐in loss due to thermal aging and light soaking is dramatically suppressed because of the frozen morphology and high miscibility of the nonfullerene acceptor (18.7% → 90.8% after 90 h at 75 °C and 37.9% → 77.5% after 90 h at AM 1.5G). The resulting crosslinked device shows 9.4% PCE (9.8% in chlorobenzene), which is the highest value reported to date for crosslinked active materials, in the first green processing approach."

In this study, it is shown that constitutively active oncogenic fusion proteins that contain PDGF or FGF receptor moieties, caused by specific chromosomal translocations in chronic myeloid neoplasms, escape this negative regulatory mechanism. Background Chimeric oncogenes encoding constitutively active protein tyrosine kinases are associated with chronic myeloid neoplasms. TEL-PDGFRβ (TPβ, also called ETV6-PDGFRB) is a hybrid protein produced by the t(5;12) translocation, FIP1L1-PDGFRα (FPα) results from a deletion on chromosome 4q12 and ZNF198-FGFR1 is created by the t(8;13) translocation. These fusion proteins are found in patients with myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia. Wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases are efficiently targeted for degradation upon activation, in a process that requires Cbl-mediated monoubiquitination of receptor lysines. Since protein degradation pathways have been identified as useful targets for cancer therapy, the aim of this study was to compare the degradation of hybrid and wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases. Design and Methods We used Ba/F3 as a model cell line, as well as leukocytes from two patients, to analyze hybrid protein degradation. Results In contrast to the corresponding wild-type receptors, which are quickly degraded upon activation, we observed that TPβ, FPα and the ZNF198-FGFR1 hybrids escaped down-regulation in Ba/F3 cells. The high stability of TPβ and FPα hybrid proteins was confirmed in leukocytes from leukemia patients. Ubiquitination of TPβ and FPα was much reduced compared to that of wild-type receptors, despite marked Cbl phosphorylation in cells expressing hybrid receptors. The fusion of a destabilizing domain to TPβ induced protein degradation. Instability was reverted by adding the destabilizing domain ligand, Shield1. The destabilization of this modified TPβ reduced cell transformation and STAT5 activation. Conclusions We have shown that chimeric receptor tyrosine kinases escape ubiquitination and down-regulation and that their stabilization is critical to efficient stimulation of cell proliferation."
58,,2016.0,Local Imaging of Optoelectronic Properties and Film Degradation in Polymer/Fullerene Solar Cells with Electrostatic Force Microscopy,"Local Imaging of Optoelectronic Properties and Film Degradation in Polymer/Fullerene Solar Cells with Electrostatic Force Microscopy Phillip Alexander Cox Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor David S. Ginger Chemistry With power conversion efficiencies on the rise, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) hold promise as a next-generation thin-film solar technology. However, both device performance and stability are inextricably linked to local film structure. Methods capable of probing nanoscale electronic properties as a function of film structure are thus a crucial component of the rational design of efficient and robust devices. This dissertation describes the use of three scanning probe methods for studying local charge generation and photodegradation in polymer/fullerene solar cells. First, we show that time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM) is capable of resolving local photocurrent from sub-bandgap excitation down to attoampere level currents, a result unattainable by traditional contact-mode methods. We find that the local charging rates measured with trEFM are proportional to external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements made on completed devices, making trEFM images equivalent to local EQE maps across the entire solar spectrum. For both phase-segregated and well-mixed MDMO-PPV:PCBM film morphologies, we show that the local distribution of photocurrent is invariant to excitation wavelength, providing local evidence for the controversial result that the probability of generating separated charge carriers does not depend on whether excitons are formed at the singlet state or charge transfer state. Next, we describe how local dissipation imaging can be performed with commercially-available frequency-modulated electrostatic force microscopy (FM-EFM) and show that dissipation maps are highly sensitive to photo-oxidative effects in organic semiconductors. We show that photo-oxidation induced changes in cantilever energy dissipation are proportional to device performance losses. We further develop dissipation imaging by implementing ringdown imaging, which directly measures the quality factor of the cantilever, enabling quantitative dissipation mapping. Using organic photovoltaic materials as a testbed, we study macroscopic device degradation as a function of photooxidation for three different film morphologies. According to EQE measurements, we find that the stability of the macroscopic devices is very sensitive to processing conditions, with films processed with the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane being the most stable. At the microscopic level, we compare the evolution of cantilever power dissipation as a function of photochemical degradation for three different polymer/fullerene blend morphologies, and show that the evolution of local power dissipation correlates with device stability. Lastly, we show that cantilever power dissipation increases more rapidly over large fullerene aggregates than in well-mixed polymer/fullerene regions, suggesting that local photochemistry on the fullerene contributes strongly to the dissipation signal."

We show that as the device is exposed to a flux of 15-MV X-rays, the recorded photocurrent undergoes a near exponential decay described by two decay constants of 1.6×10-4 and 1.8×10-3 Gy-1. In order to understand the degradation mechanisms of the device, we expose the constituent parts to a significant dose (~4.2 kGy) of 15-MV X-rays and record changes in the photoluminescence and absorption spectra of the P3HT, and also explore the current-voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency of the OPVs. We use our results to comment on the induced degradation mechanisms resulting from the exposure to X-rays."

At present, the lifetime and stability of OPV devices is much shorter and poor mainly caused by oxygen, moisture, and light resulting in the oxidation on low work function electrodes and the degradation of the morphology of the photoactive layer. To improve the lifetime and stability of the OPV devices, we used newly developed low bandgap polymer, PCDTBT, as the electron acceptor material and a solution based titanium sub-oxide (TiOx) interfacial layer inserted between the active layer and the cathode. In our experiment, we fabricated unencapsulated bulk heterojunctions OPV devices based on the high and low bandgap polymers of P3HT:PC61BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM, respectively. We synthesized a solution based TiOx by using a sol-gel chemistry method. We performed stability tests on the OPV devices: (1) with and without the TiOx layer (Case (I)) to test the effectiveness of the TiOx layer in protecting the photoactive layer from degradation, (2) with and without a protection cover (a high research grade opaque A1 foil) to observe the device performance in a dark/light environment (Case (II)), and (3) in different storage media conditions: (a) air, (b) glove box, (3) ante-chamber of a glove box, and (4) (Case (III)). We spent significant time and effort in optimizing the fabrication processing steps including; the thickness of the active layer, pre-annealing and post-annealing treatments. We fabricated the OPV devices by using the optimal fabrication procedure. We found that the best PCE value of 4.1% achieved for the P3HT:PC61BM OPV cell and 5.1% for the PCDTBT:PC71BM OPV cell. On the air stability test, we found that the OPV cell of P3HT:PC61BM materials showed good air stability performance resulting in the PCE only dropping 26% over a period of 70 days (stored in a glove box). The PCDTBT:PC71BM devices stored in the glove box over a period of 30 days showed relatively good air stability performances; (1) the device with a TiOx layer and an opaque A1 cover the PCE dropped only 16%, (2) the device with the TiOx layer and without an opaque A1 cover PCE dropped 34%, and (3) the device without a TiOx layer and with an A1 cover PCE dropped 48%. While the PCDTBT:PC71BM devices stored in the air; (1-2) with a TiOx layer and with/without opaque A1 covers the PCE values dropped 92% after 18 days, and (3) without the TiOx layer and with an opaque A1 cover, the PCE dropped 100% after 3 days. These results highlight the effectiveness of the TiOx layer in protecting the active layer from degradation. We concluded that the TiOx layer effectively improved the stability the OPV devices.

61,10.1117/12.929579,2012.0,Combined characterization techniques to understand the stability of a variety of organic photovoltaic devices: the ISOS-3 inter-laboratory collaboration,"This work is part of the inter-laboratory collaboration to study the stability of seven distinct sets of state-of-the-art organic photovoltaic (OPVs) devices prepared by leading research laboratories. All devices have been shipped to and degraded at the Danish Technical University (DTU, formerly RISO-DTU) up to 1830 hours in accordance with established ISOS-3 protocols under defined illumination conditions. In this work we present a summary of the degradation response observed for the NREL sample, an inverted OPV of the type ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag/Al, under full sun stability test. The results reported from the combination of the different characterization techniques results in a proposed degradation mechanism. The final conclusion is that the failure of the photovoltaic response of the device is mainly due to the degradation of the electrodes and not to the active materials of the solar cell."
62,10.1021/acsami.3c01779,2023.0,Flexible Solution-Processed Electron-Transport-Layer-Free Organic Photovoltaics for Indoor Application.,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have unique advantages of low weight, mechanical flexibility, and solution processability, which make them exceptionally suitable for integrating low-power Internet of Things devices. However, achieving improved operational stability together with solution processes that are applicable to large-scale fabrication remains challenging. Their major limitation arises due to the instable factors that occur both inside the thick active film and from the ambient environment, which cannot be completely resolved via the current encapsulation techniques used for flexible OPVs. Additionally, thin active layers are highly vulnerable to point defects, which result in low yield rates and impede the laboratory-to-industry translation. In this study, flexible fully solution-processed OPVs with improved indoor efficiency and long-term operational stability than that of conventional OPVs with evaporated electrodes are achieved. Benefiting from the oxygen and water vapor permeation barrier of the spontaneously formed gallium oxide layers on the exposed eutectic gallium-indium surface, fast degradation of the OPVs with thick active layers is prevented, maintaining 93% of its initial Pmax after 5000 min of indoor operation under 1000 lx light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. Additionally, by using the thick active layer, spin-coated silver nanowires could be directly used as bottom electrodes without complicated flattening processes, thereby substantially simplifying the fabrication process and proposing a promising manufacturing technique for devices with high-throughput energy demands."
63,10.1002/EJOC.201101264,2012.0,Stability of a 2′-O-(Carbamoylmethyl)adenosine-Containing Dinucleotide,"In the interest of pursuing the synthesis of 2′-O-carbamoylmethyl-modified oligonucleotides from building blocks already containing the modification, we have performed studies on the chemical and enzymatic stability of a 2′-O-carbamoylmethyl-modified dinucleotide. The dinucleotide was subjected to ammonolysis and other basic conditions such as treatment with ethylenediamine and sodium hydroxide at different temperatures. The amide of the carbamoylmethyl group partially hydrolyzed under standard deprotection conditions for oligonucleotide synthesis (conc. aq. NH3 at 55 °C). However, under several other conditions, including saturated NH3 in methanol, the amide remained intact. Treatment of the dinucleotide with Phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus adamanteus venom and Phosphodiesterase II from Bovine spleen, showed that the carbamoylmethyl moiety gives substantial protection of the phosphodiester towards enzymatic degradation."
64,10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c01503,2024.0,(De)sodiation Mechanism of Bi2MoO6 in Na-Ion Batteries Probed by Quasi-Simultaneous Operando PDF and XAS,"Operando characterization can reveal degradation processes in battery materials and are essential for the development of battery chemistries. This study reports the first use of quasi-simultaneous operando pair distribution function (PDF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of a battery cell, providing a detailed, atomic-level understanding of the cycling mechanism of Bi2MoO6 as an anode material for Na-ion batteries. This material cycles via a combined conversion-alloying reaction, where electrochemically active, nanocrystalline NaxBi particles embedded in an amorphous Na–Mo–O matrix are formed during the first sodiation. The combination of operando PDF and XAS revealed that Bi obtains a positive oxidation state at the end of desodiation, due to formation of Bi–O bonds at the interface between the Bi particles and the Na–Mo–O matrix. In addition, XAS confirmed that Mo has an average oxidation state of +6 throughout the (de)sodiation process and, thus, does not contribute to the capacity. However, the local environment of Mo6+ changes from tetrahedral coordination in the desodiated state to distorted octahedral in the sodiated state. These structural changes are linked to the poor cycling stability of Bi2MoO6, as flexibility of this matrix allows movement and coalescence of the NaxBi particles, which is detrimental to the electrochemical stability."
65,10.1128/mcb.8.10.4197-4203.1988,1988.0,Selective removal of alpha heavy-chain glycosylation sites causes immunoglobulin A degradation and reduced secretion,"The importance of carbohydrate in the secretion of immunoglobulin A (IgA) has previously been suggested by results of studies with tunicamycin, which prevents N-linked glycosylation of all cell glycoproteins. To directly evaluate the role of individual oligosaccharides in the secretion of IgA, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to selectively eliminate the two N-linked attachment sites reported to be glycosylated in alpha heavy chains. Transfected wild-type and mutant alpha genes were expressed in kappa light-chain-producing MPC-11 variant myeloma cells, and secretion kinetics of the IgAs were compared. Removal of either or both glycosylation sites led to intracellular alpha heavy-chain degradation and a 90 to 95% inhibition of IgA secretion. These results reveal that both N-linked oligosaccharides of the alpha heavy chain are essential for intracellular stability and normal secretion of IgA. This suggests that the key function of carbohydrate here is to maintain proper conformation of the glycoprotein. We also found that when expressed in the MPC-11 variant cells, alpha heavy chains were glycosylated at a third, normally unused site."
66,10.1021/bm401667b,2013.0,Tuning the Degradation Profiles of Poly(l-lactide)-Based Materials through Miscibility,"The effective use of biodegradable polymers relies on the ability to control the onset of and time needed for degradation. Preferably, the material properties should be retained throughout the intended time frame, and the material should degrade in a rapid and controlled manner afterward. The degradation profiles of polyester materials were controlled through their miscibility. Systems composed of PLLA blended with poly[(R,S)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (a-PHB) and polypropylene adipate (PPA) with various molar masses were prepared through extrusion. Three different systems were used: miscible (PLLA/a-PHB5 and PLLA/a-PHB20), partially miscible (PLLA/PPA5/comp and PLLA/PPA20/comp), and immiscible (PLLA/PPA5 and PLLA/PPA20) blends. These blends and their respective homopolymers were hydrolytically degraded in water at 37 °C for up to 1 year. The blends exhibited entirely different degradation profiles but showed no diversity between the total degradation times of the materials. PLLA presented a two-stage degradation profile with a rapid decrease in molar mass during the early stages of degradation, similar to the profile of PLLA/a-PHB5. PLLA/a-PHB20 presented a single, constant linear degradation profile. PLLA/PPA5 and PLLA/PPA20 showed completely opposing degradation profiles relative to PLLA, exhibiting a slow initial phase and a rapid decrease after a prolonged degradation time. PLLA/PPA5/comp and PLLA/PPA20/comp had degradation profiles between those of the miscible and the immiscible blends. The molar masses of the materials were approximately the same after 1 year of degradation despite their different profiles. The blend composition and topographical images captured at the last degradation time point demonstrate that the blending component was not leached out during the period of study. The hydrolytic stability of degradable polyester materials can be tailored to obtain different and predetermined degradation profiles for future applications."

The corresponding H-phosphonate building block was also synthesised, and from this intermediate, a 2′-O-[N-(aminoethyl)carbamoyl]methyl-containing dinucleotide could be made. We also performed studies on the chemical and enzymatic stability of this dinucleotide. The dinucleotide was subjected to different ammonolysis and other basic conditions, and HPLC analysis showed that the modification was intact to most conditions, but that there was some minor hydrolysis when NH3 (concd. aq.) was used at 55 °C. Under several other sets of conditions, including saturated NH3 in methanol, and ethylenediamine, the amide remained intact. Treatment of the dinucleotide with Phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus adamanteus venom and Phosphodiesterase II from bovine spleen showed that the N-(aminoethyl)carbamoylmethyl moiety gives the phosphodiester linkage substantial protection against enzymatic degradation; the phosphodiester was not degraded by PDE II at all after seven days."

69,,2013.0,Formulation of Inactivated Polio Vaccine for Thermal Stability,"SUMMARY Polio eradication and post-eradication programs require cost-effective methods of mass vaccination. We are developing microneedle patches to simplify vaccination and reduce costs. Here, we studied formulations that stabilize inactivated polio vaccine during drying and storage, and found that formulation with maltodextrin and ovalbumin retained full stability after 4 weeks storage at 22 o C and maintained 60% stability after 4 weeks storage at 40 o C. On-going research seeks to provide still greater stability for longer times. INTRODUCTION Eradication of wild-type poliovirus is being pursued with oral polio vaccine (OPV), which is facilitated by simple mass vaccination by minimally trained personnel, often door-to-door [1]. However, OPV vaccination carries the risk of virus mutation into a virulent form. Thus, posteradication efforts to control vaccine-derived polio require the use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which does not carry this risk. However, IPV administration is costly, because it requires expert personnel to give the vaccine at central locations, thereby increasing cost and complexity of vaccination campaigns. We are developing a microneedle patch that enables simple IPV mass vaccination by minimally trained personnel. To further simplify vaccination campaigns and reduced costs, we seek to formulate the patch to stabilize IPV for storage without refrigeration. This is a significant challenge given that commercial IPV is formulated as a liquid that is stored under refrigeration, because it is not generally stable upon drying or storage at elevated temperature. Because microneedle patches are solid-state devices, this project seeks to stabilize IPV during drying and storage at elevated temperature. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS To identify suitable formulations to stabilize IPV during drying and storage, we screened 60 different GRAS excipients, including biocompatible natural and synthetic polymers; oligomers; mono-, diand polysaccharides; sugar alcohols; amino acids; vitamins; and salts, as listed in Table 1. Each individual excipient was formulated with IPV (IPOL, Sanofi Pasteur) in liquid solution, placed in 96well plates and air-dried at room temperature overnight until the water content was less than 8 wt% of the total mass of the formulation on a dry basis. For mixed formulations, we selected excipients that maintained stability greater than 40% after 1 week storage at 40 o C, and mixed them at a 1:1 mass ratio. To study stability during storage, the formulations dried as a thin film inside the wells were packaged with nitrogen and desiccant, stored at 40 o C for up to 4 weeks, and then reconstituted at different times for ELISA assay (using antibody for type 2 IPV). The percentage stability of IPV in the formulation was calculated in comparison with non-processed liquid IPV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION As control experiments, IPV and OPV (from stock solution kindly provided by Serum Institute of India) were dried without any stabilizing excipients and stored at 40 o C for two weeks. As shown in Fig. 1a, IPV and OPV both lost integrity (as assessed by ELISA) significantly upon drying and were fully degraded within days, consistent with previous findings that polio vaccine is unstable upon drying. To identify formulations capable of stabilizing IPV during drying, we screened 60 different formulation excipients and found that the best four excipients (dextrin, ovalbumin and maltodextrin (DE 4 and 13)) maintained IPV stability at approximately 50% of the positive control (non-processed IPV) after 1 week storage at 40 o C, as shown in Fig. 1b. Based on this screen of single excipients, we examined mixtures of two excipients with the hypothesis that the mixed formulation of two excipients that may stabilize the vaccine in different ways can enhance the stability of IPV during storage even further. As shown in Fig. 1c, we found that the best formulation (i.e., maltodextrin DE 13 and ovalbumin) maintained more than 80% stability after 1 week at 40 o C and still maintained 60% stability after 4 weeks at 40 o C. In a supplemental study, we found that this formulation retained full integrity of IPV after storage for 4 weeks at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 1d. Table 1. List of excipients"

71,,2011.0,Understanding Degradation Pathways in Organic Photovoltaics (Poster),"Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) recently attained power conversion efficiencies that are of interest for commercial production. Consequently, one of the most important unsolved issues facing a new industry is understanding what governs lifetime in organic devices and discovering solutions to mitigate degradation mechanisms. Historically, the active organic components are considered vulnerable to photo-oxidation and represent the primary degradation channel. However, we present several (shelf life and light soaking) studies pointing the relative stability of the active layers and instabilities in commonly used electrode materials. We show that engineering of the hole/electron layer at the electrode can lead to environmentally stable devices even without encapsulation."

The morphological study illustrated that Fe2O3 nanoparticles were dispersed and embedded well within the PCL matrix. The size of Fe2O3 nanoparticles were below 250 nm. The thermal stability of Fe2O3/PCL nanocomposites was lower than neat PCL, which might be due to Fe2O3 (act as catalyst during the thermal degradation of PCL). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses show that the crystallization temperature of the nanocomposites was slightly enhanced as compared to neat PCL. The polarized optical microscopy (POM) analyses showed that the size of Fe2O3/PCL nanocomposites spherulites were smaller than neat PCL. The photodegradation study presented that the nanocomposites photodegraded higher quantity of rhodamine B dye as compared to neat PCL. The neat PCL degraded about 24 and 72% while Fe2O3 (6 wt%)/PCL nanocomposites degraded about 72 and 98% of dye within 2 and 10 h, respectively."

In our investigations of 2, we were surprised by its remarkable stability in solution. Using UV−vis spectroscopy we observe that under ambient light conditions, 2 is approximately 50× more stable toward degradation in air-saturated tetrahydrofuran solution as compared to unsubstituted pentacene. Previous investigators have implicated oxygen in the mechanism of photodegradation of pentacene. In this study, quantum chemical calculations have been performed which demonstrate that alkynyl functionalization at the 6 and 13 positions reduces the rate of photooxidation in two ways.

No analytical method is reported for estimation of impurities in Piribedil. The objective of this work was to develop a stability indicating method for estimation of impurities in Piribedil Tablets by using quality by design approach. Piribedil and its impurities are having different absorption maxima hence known impurities and unknown impurities were quantified at 210 nm and 238 nm respectively. Phosphate buffer (pH 4.3; 25 mM) and mixture of Phosphate buffer, Methanol, Acetonitrile (30:40:30, v/v respectively) were used in gradient elution mode. Zorbax SB Phenyl (150 x 4.6) mm, 3.5 µm column was used for separation. Mobile phase was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute and column was maintained at 45°. Injection volume was optimized as 10 µl. Critical chromatographic parameters such as Column oven temperature and pH of buffer were optimized by performing Design of experiments. Forced degradation studies were performed and all the degradants formed during forced degradation, were well separated from known impurities and from Piribedil peak. Mass balance was found more than > 98% in all the stressed conditions. The developed method was validated and found specific, precise, linear, accurate, rugged and robust."
75,,2014.0,In vitro enzymatic degradation of lipidified apomorphine,"SUMMARY Lipophilic diester derivatives of apomorphine were synthesized and purified using column chromatography. The extent of intestinal enzymatic degradation of the diester mediated predominantly by pancreatic lipase was assessed in vitro. The potential of lipids to protect against the enzymatic degradation of apomorphine diester is currently being investigated. INTRODUCTION Apomorphine is administered subcutaneously for Parkinson’s disease, as the compound undergoes significant first-pass metabolism upon oral administration. It possesses short half-life causing a need for frequent administration and thus leading to problems with patient compliance 1 . A possible strategy to overcome this may be to develop a lipid based oral delivery system for apomorphine by synthesizing its lipophilic prodrugs. The lipidified apomorphine administered with lipids may have a potential to stimulate the lymphatic transport and thereby, avoid the first pass metabolism. The aim of this study was to synthesize and purify diesters of apomorphine using fatty acid chloride and apomorphine as well as to investigate in vitro enzymatic stability in fasted state simulating intestinal fluids (FaSSIF). EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Apomorphine diesters were synthesized based on the method reported by Borgman et al 2 with some modifications. Apomorphine HCl·1⁄2H2O was dissolved in trifluroacetic acid and treated with an excess of the appropriate acid chloride. The mixture was warmed on a water bath for 6-7 h (65°C), followed by the removal of volatiles under reduced pressure. After liquid-liquid extraction to remove excess of trifluoroacetic acid, the crude product was purified by column chromatography with ethyl acetate:heptane (1:1) with 5% triethylamine. The fractions containing product were collected and the purity was assessed and confirmed by using LC-MS and NMR. The in vitro degradation experiments were based on previously reported method with some modifications 4 . It was performed using 5mL FaSSIF, which was prepared by using bile salts (3mM), phospholipids (0.75 mM), sodium chloride (68 mM) and maleate (20 mM, pH 6.5). Dilauroyl apomorphine (C12 diester) was used in these experiments. The diester was dissolved either in 200μL ethanol without oil or in 100mg soybean oil and 200μL ethanol. The degradation was initiated by addition of pancreatin to yield pancreatic lipase activity of 550U/mL with stirring at 37°C. Samples were collected before addition of enzyme, and 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min after; and further degradation of diester in samples was inhibited with an immediate dilution in organic solvent. The amount of diester was quantified by HPLC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Two apomorphine alkyl diesters were synthesized containing either a C12 or C16 chain. The purity and mass were confirmed by NMR and LC-MS. The structure and MS spectrum of dilauroyl apomorphine (C12 diester) is shown in Fig.1. The diester product was found to be free from the reactants (apomorphine and fatty acid chloride), free fatty acids and monoesters as impurities.

76,,2010.0,Original Research Papers Development and Validation of a Stability- Indicating UHPLC Method for Assay of Felbamate and Related Substances,"Summary. A new, sensitive, stability-indicating, and cost and time-effective isocratic reversed-phase UHPLC method has been developed for quantitative analysis of felbamate, an antiepileptic drug, both in the bulk drug and in pharmaceutical dosage forms. Chromatographic separation of felbamate and its two impurities was achieved on a C18 column with a simple buffer–methanol mobile phase; the run time was 8 min. Quantification was achieved by ultraviolet detection. Resolution between the impurities was >2.0. Response was a linear function of concentration over the range 0.1–3.0 μg mL−1, correlation coefficient >0.999, for felbamate and the impurities. The method is capable of detecting the two impurities at levels of 0.002% (0.02 μg mL−1) of the test concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 (1 μL injection). The same sensitivity was achieved for all the degradation products formed during stress studies in which the drug was subjected to hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis, and thermal degradation. Substantial degradation occurred under acidic and basic conditions. The stressed test solutions were assayed against felbamate working standard and the mass balance in each case was close to 100%, indicating the method is stability-indicating. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness in accordance with ICH Guidelines."
77,,2015.0,Characterisation and lifetime studies of CPDT- and BT- based photovoltaic cells,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices provide an opportunity for low cost, printable solar cells. This thesis focuses upon improving power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and lifetimes of OPV devices, with an emphasis on studying materials made from cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) monomers. The first part of the work focuses on characterising the optical and electrical properties of new materials based on this material system. A donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) small molecule, with the monomer order of CPDTBT-CPDT (C2B1) was trialled and demonstrated an optical band gap of 1.8 eV. OFET mobility was measured as 5 x 10 cm.V.s in the saturation region, and when blended with phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), gave a PCE of 1.54% under AM1.5G illumination. The moderate performance directed research towards donor-acceptor (D-A) polymers (PCPDTBT), synthesised using direct heterolytic arylation. OPV devices made with this material blended with PC71BM gave a maximum PCE of 4.23%, when tested under AM1.5G. OPV device performance is slightly higher than for PCPDTBT synthesised using more established techniques. This is the first known report of a working device with an active layer polymer synthesised using the direct heterolytic arylation route. The stability of the PCPDTBT material was tested using a combination of OPV device data and analytical instruments. From device data, PCPDTBT was shown to be less stable than the more commonly reported P3HT material. Significantly, processing additives used to optimise the active layer morphology, are shown to be detrimental to long-term performance, approximately halving the device half-life (T50%). The physical changes are examined using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and show that the inclusion of processing additives leads to greater morphological changes during ageing experiments. The chemical changes occurring in PCPDTBT were examined using XPS and show that light soaking leads to observations of severe oxidation, with a break-up of the aromatic rings, formation of sulphates at the thiophene ring, chain scission in the polymer backbone and loss of side chains. However, it is concluded that morphological changes are mostly responsible for the observed decrease in OPV device PCE. PCPDTBT with thermally initiated cross-linking behaviour is characterised and used to fabricate OPV cells. Cross-linkable PCPDTBT demonstrates a PCE of 3.65%, which is similar to its non-cross-linkable analogue, however, improved stability is observed from ageing experiments. This increase in stability, investigated further using AFM and GISAXS, is a result of fewer morphological changes in the active layer. While the work has focussed on PCPDTBT, many of the conclusions regarding the analysis of material degradation could be of wider interest to the field. The analysis could provide some new insights, on the degradation and stability of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives."
78,10.1039/C2JM15670A,2012.0,Stable organic photovoltaics using Ag thin film anodes,"The interaction at the interface between a metal electrode and photoactive polymer is crucial for overall performance and stability of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this article, we report a comparative study of the stability of thin film Ag and indium tin oxide (ITO) as electrodes when used in conjunction with an interfacial PEDOT:PSS layer for P3HT:PCBM blend OPV devices. XPS measurements were taken for Ag and ITO/PEDOT:PSS layered samples with different exposure times to ambient conditions (∼25 °C, ∼50% relative humidity) to investigate the migration of Ag and In into the PEDOT:PSS layer. The change in efficiency of OPVs with a longer exposure time and degree of migration is explained by the analysis of XPS results. We propose the mechanism behind the interactions occurring at the interfaces. The efficiency of the ITO electrode OPVs continuously decreased to below 10% of the initial efficiency. However, the Ag devices displayed a slower degradation and maintained 50% of the initial efficiency for the same period of time."

Studying their electrochemical dealloying is a fundamental step towards the understanding of both their activity and stability. Herein, size-selected 9 nm PtxY nanoparticles have been deposited on the cathode side of a PEMFC specifically designed for in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS). The dealloying mechanism was followed in situ for the first time. It proceeds through the progressive oxidation of alloyed Y atoms, soon leading to the accumulation of Y(3+) cations at the cathode. Acid leaching with sulfuric acid is capable of accelerating the dealloying process and removing these Y(3+) cations which might cause long term degradation of the membrane. The use of APXPS under near operating conditions allowed observing the population of oxygenated surface species as a function of the electrochemical potential. Similar to the case of pure Pt nanoparticles, non-hydrated hydroxide plays a key role in the ORR catalytic process."
80,,2010.0,"Production, Characterization and Stability of Organic Solar Cell Devices","Despite the fact that the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is in a rapid progress, organic solar cells continue taking backstage roll in the growing markets of various solar technologies. The main challenge of the field is to develop devices that would possess all the optimal properties required for efficient, stable and cheap solar cells, i.e. devices that can deliver high photoconversion efficiencies and long lifetimes and can be efficiently produced in large scales using roll-to-roll coating technologies. This dissertation is primarily devoted to the issues of photoconversion efficiency and device lifetimes. In particular, descriptions of some practical approaches for different device designs and processing of active layer for typical small scale OPV devices were presented. The emphasis was put on some optimizing techniques for processing of active layer that can significantly improve the device photoconversion efficiency. The techniques were further applied for manufacturing and characterization of solar cell devices based on various materials. In particular, a number of thermocleavable polymers were studied and devices based on such materials were produced and characterized. The applicability of such materials in photovoltaic devices was shown and further challenges were discussed. Another task of this work was to manufacture and study inverted device structures and compare their properties with normal structure based devices. Device based on both structure were successfully produced with same level of performance in terms of photoconversion efficiency, yet with totally different stability performance. As another task, metal oxides, such as MoO3 or V2O5 were studied in solar cell devices as buffer layers instead of PEDOT:PSS. Although the device efficiencies obtained with metal oxides were inferior to PEDOT based device, it was shown that such materials can possibly improve the device efficiency if the processing of the layers is optimized. The final part of the work is devoted to the issue of stability. In particular, a setup comprising an atmospheric chamber was presented for efficient lifetime evaluation of OPV devices and examples of exploitation of the setup were shown. Lifetime studies of various thermocleavable polymers were carried out and compared to commonly used thiophene based polymers. Comparative degradation studies were carried out for normal and inverted device structures under different atmospheric conditions, which revealed different degrading features for different structures. While the normal geometry devices were rather stable in oxygen and rapidly degraded in"

Plants offer a safe and cost‐effective production platform for biopharmaceuticals, vaccines and industrial enzymes boosting biomass conversion to biofuels. Production of intact and functional protein is a prerequisite for large‐scale protein production, and extensive host‐specific post‐translational modifications (PTMs) often affect the catalytic properties and stability of recombinant enzymes. Here we investigated the impact of plant PTMs on enzyme performance and stability of the major cellobiohydrolase TrCel7A from Trichoderma reesei, an industrially relevant enzyme. TrCel7A was produced in Nicotiana benthamiana using a vacuum‐based transient expression technology, and this recombinant enzyme (TrCel7Arec) was compared with the native fungal enzyme (TrCel7Anat) in terms of PTMs and catalytic activity on commercial and industrial substrates. We show that the N‐terminal glutamate of TrCel7Arec was correctly processed by N. benthamiana to a pyroglutamate, critical for protein structure, while the linker region of TrCel7Arec was vulnerable to proteolytic digestion during protein production due to the absence of O‐mannosylation in the plant host as compared with the native protein. In general, the purified full‐length TrCel7Arec had 25% lower catalytic activity than TrCel7Anat and impaired substrate‐binding properties, which can be attributed to larger N‐glycans and lack of O‐glycans in TrCel7Arec. All in all, our study reveals that the glycosylation machinery of N. benthamiana needs tailoring to optimize the production of efficient cellulases."
82,,2015.0,Facile route to freestanding CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 crystals using inverse solubility,"Since the first peer-reviewed publications of metalorgano halide perovskite based solar cells in 20091, research in materials of this family has undergone immense revival. They unite a broad range of suitable characteristics including long-range charge diffusion2, high extinction coefficient as well as ease of fabrication3. With solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies now exceeding 20%4, some already regard them as possible competitors to the well-established silicon technology5,6. Despite the undisputable impressive developments in conversion efficiencies for laboratory scale devices since the first reports, many non-trivial issues including long-term device stability and reproducibility, material degradation and toxicity of the water-soluble lead halide as well the establishment of reliable device testing protocols remain yet to be solved7. Much effort has been invested into the optimization of deposition conditions for thin films for application in solar cells with processes ranging from simple one-step solution deposition over sequential deposition processes8,9 to vapor based processes10,11. In most reported solution growth methods for freestanding crystals, supersaturation is achieved by cooling saturated solutions or by addition of poor solvents12,13. To the best of our knowledge, none of the reported protocols for the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 structures, including thin films as well as freestanding products, rely on inverse solubility. We report a facile method for rapid growth of large, freestanding crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 from a solution of γ -butyrolactone (GBL) through heating at unconventionally high temperatures. To our knowledge, the possibility of formation of crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 from solution in a good solvent without additives has not been reported. Several methods for the growth of freestanding crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 from solution have been reported14. Commonly, growing large freestanding crystals in solution is a slow process but Yang et al.15 have demonstrated a simple and efficient method for growth of CH3NH3PbI3 via sequential solution growth method. Their process allowed for the formation of crystals of a range of habits and sizes. Recently, Kollek et al. have reported a novel single-precursor route for the preparation of a range of nanostructures including porous, shape-anisotropic single crystals via crystal-to-crystal transformation16. Studies of important physical properties such as thermal conductivity, Hall Effect and others, commonly have to rely on freestanding structures rather than thin films17. Reported formations of"

Curcumin, one of the most important pharmacologically significant natural
products, has gained significant consideration among scientists for decades since its multipharmacological
activities. 1, 3-Dicarbonyl moiety of curcumin was found to be accountable for the
rapid degradation of curcumin molecule. The aim of present work is to replace 1, 3-dicarbonyl moiety
of curcumin by pyrazole and phenylpyrazole derivatives with a view to improving its stability and to
investigate the role of substitution in N-phenylpyrazole curcumin on its antibacterial activity against
both Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria.



Pyrazole derivatives of curcumin were prepared by heating curcumin with phenyhydrazine/
substituted phenyhydrazine derivatives in AcOH. The residue was purified by silica gel column
chromatography. Structures of purified compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR and Mass spectroscopy.
The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity by the microdilution broth
susceptibility test method against gram positive (S. aureus) and gram negative (E. coli).



Effects of substitution in N-phenylpyrazole curcumin derivatives against S. aureus and E. coli
were studied. The most active N-(3-Nitrophenylpyrazole) curcumin (12) exhibits twenty-fold more potency
against S. aureus (MIC: 10μg/mL)) and N-(2-Fluoroophenylpyrazole) curcumin (5) fivefold more
potency against E. coli (MIC; 50 μg/mL) than N-phenylpyrazole curcumin (4). Whereas, a remarkable
decline in anti-bacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli was observed when electron donating
groups were incorporated in N-phenylpyrazole curcumin (4). Comparative studies of synthesized compounds
suggest the effects of electron withdrawing and electron donating groups on unsubstituted phenylpyrazole
curcumin (4).



The structure-activity relationship (SAR) results indicated that the electron withdrawing
and electron donating at N-phenylpyrazole curcumin played key roles for their bacterial inhibitory effects.
The results of the antibacterial evaluation showed that the synthesized pyrazole derivatives of
curcumin displayed moderate to very high activity in S. aureus. In conclusion, the series of novel curcumin
derivatives were designed, synthesized and tested for their antibacterial activities against S. aureus
and E. coli. Among them, N-(3-Nitrophenylpyrazole curcumin; 12) was most active against S. aureus
(Gram-positive) and N-(2-Fluoroophenylpyrazole) curcumin (5) against E. coli (Gram-negative) bacteria.

84,10.1056/NEJMoa1508419,2016.0,Variant ASGR1 Associated with a Reduced Risk of Coronary Artery Disease.,"BACKGROUND
Several sequence variants are known to have effects on serum levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol that alter the risk of coronary artery disease.


METHODS
We sequenced the genomes of 2636 Icelanders and found variants that we then imputed into the genomes of approximately 398,000 Icelanders. We tested for association between these imputed variants and non-HDL cholesterol levels in 119,146 samples. We then performed replication testing in two populations of European descent. We assessed the effects of an implicated loss-of-function variant on the risk of coronary artery disease in 42,524 case patients and 249,414 controls from five European ancestry populations. An augmented set of genomes was screened for additional loss-of-function variants in a target gene. We evaluated the effect of an implicated variant on protein stability.


RESULTS
We found a rare noncoding 12-base-pair (bp) deletion (del12) in intron 4 of ASGR1, which encodes a subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, a lectin that plays a role in the homeostasis of circulating glycoproteins. The del12 mutation activates a cryptic splice site, leading to a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon that renders a truncated protein prone to degradation. Heterozygous carriers of the mutation (1 in 120 persons in our study population) had a lower level of non-HDL cholesterol than noncarriers, a difference of 15.3 mg per deciliter (0.40 mmol per liter) (P=1.0×10(-16)), and a lower risk of coronary artery disease (by 34%; 95% confidence interval, 21 to 45; P=4.0×10(-6)). In a larger set of sequenced samples from Icelanders, we found another loss-of-function ASGR1 variant (p.W158X, carried by 1 in 1850 persons) that was also associated with lower levels of non-HDL cholesterol (P=1.8×10(-3)).


CONCLUSIONS
ASGR1 haploinsufficiency was associated with reduced levels of non-HDL cholesterol and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)."
85,10.1088/0022-3727/49/8/085601,2016.0,Alternative selection of processing additives to enhance the lifetime of OPVs,"The use of processing additives is known to accelerate the degradation of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and therefore, this paper studies the impact of selecting alternative processing additives for PCPDTBT:PC71BM solar cells in order to improve the stability. The use of naphthalene-based processing additives has been undertaken, which is shown to reduce the initial power conversion efficiency by 23%–42%, primarily due to a decrease in the short-circuit current density, but also fill factor. However, the stability is greatly enhanced by using such additives, with the long term stability (T50%) enhanced by a factor of four. The results show that there is a trade-off between initial performance and stability to consider when selecting the initial process additives. XPS studies have provided some insight into the decreased degradation and show that using 1-chloronaphthalene (ClN) leads to reduced morphology changes and reduced oxidation of the thiophene-ring within the PCPDTBT backbone."

PEGs of four different molecular weights (2k, 6k, 10k, and 20k) were functionalized with G1-allyl dendrons using anhydride chemistry to produce tetra-functional TEC crosslinkable PEGs. The tetra-functional PEGs were subsequently crosslinked with a tri-functional thiol in ethanol to form hydrogels. The synthesized hydrogels were characterized with respect to swelling behaviour, rheological properties and hydrolytic degradation. It was found that the molecular weight of the PEG chain greatly influences the final properties of the hydrogel, where a higher molecular weight of PEG gives an increased weight swelling ratio from 240% for PEG-2k hydrogels to 1400% for PEG-20k hydrogels, as well as decreased elastic moduli, with Young's moduli ranging from 106 MPa to 6 MPa, for PEG-2k and PEG-20k hydrogels, respectively. It was also found that the hydrolytic stability in alkaline conditions (pH 10) decreased when the molecular weight of PEG in the hydrogels increased."
87,10.1039/C3TC31900H,2014.0,Extremely stable organic photovoltaic incorporated with WOx doped PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer,"The state of interfaces between organic semiconductors and/or metals in organic devices severely impacts their performance and stability. The commonly used organic semiconductor PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) is hygroscopic in nature and can therefore be easily damaged if exposed to air and/or light illumination. In this study, we doped PEDOT:PSS with WOx nanocrystallites and found that organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with the WOx doped PEDOT:PSS degrade only by 5%, while OPVs with undoped PEDOT:PSS retain only 23% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after storing for 5000 h in air. Also, doping PEDOT:PSS with WOx enhances the initial PCE by ∼13%, owing to reduced leakage current density and better Ohmic contact between the PEDOT:PSS and the anode."
88,,2015.0,Synthesis and characterisation in organic electronics,"Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted great interest in recent years due to their potential for offering low-cost solar energy conversion. However, problems, such as low efficiency and short lifetimes limit their application. Mechanical and electrical instability of OPVs is a result of complex degradation processes such as delamination. As this process occurs at the weakest interface in OPV devices, located between poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(p-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and the photoactive layer, the adhesion could be improved by introduction of an interlayer between the aforementioned layers. To this end, new amphiphilic interfacial copolymers were designed. The aim was to obtain a block copolymer consisting of a hydrophilic block being in contact with the PEDOT:PSS layer and a hydrophobic block interacting with the photoactive layer. Since, roll-to-roll OPV production requires deposition of materials from solution, a post-deposition method of thermal transformation of the hydrophobic copolymer into amphiphilic material was developed. Firstly, a protocol for the synthesis of thermally modifiable R-alkyl p-styrene sulfonates was optimised using Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. Subsequently, thermal behaviour of the products comprising various alkyl protecting groups was investigated. As a result, the isobutyl group was identified as the most thermally labile, but storage-stable, protecting group, and therefore, was used for synthesis of the thermally modifiable poly(isobutyl p-styrene sulfonate) (PiBSS) block. In the next step, the best conditions for preparation of the poly(dodecyl p-styrene sulfonate) (PDDSS) hydrophobic block were optimised. Finally, a library of new interfacial PiBSS-b-PDDSS copolymers with varied lengths of both blocks was synthesised. Thermal behaviour of the copolymers was tested in the bulk and in films, with the thin film morphologies studied further by Grazing Incidence Small- and Wide-angle X-ray Scattering. Preliminary electrical studies on devices with the incorporated interlayer were performed showing the potential for further use of these copolymers in OPV. In the industrial component of this thesis (Chapter 4), a series of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(p- styrene sulfonate) (PEO-PSS) block copolymers was synthesised for application as counter ion templates in EDOT polymerisation. Significant differences in PEDOT dispersion quality were observed whist using PEO-b-PSS, PSS-b-PEO-b-PSS and PEO-PSS multiblock copolymers, showing that the latter gave the most stable dispersions. Overall, this work presents the preparation of new copolymers particularly attractive to roll- to-roll industrial printing of organic electronics for their long-term stability"
89,,2016.0,Solution processed hole extraction interfaces for polymer solar cells,"Organic semiconductors often make poor ohmic contacts with electrodes due to the 
deep energy levels forming an energetic barrier at the interfaces between the organic 
layer and the electrode contact. The mismatch in energy levels at the interface was 
overcome by inserting PEDOT:PSS material as an anode interlayer for achieving good 
ohmic contact and selecting single types of charge carriers at the polymer-electrode 
interface. Despite the significant development that was observed in the OPVs 
performance, the residual moisture and the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS can cause 
degradation of the organic films and therefore affect long term stability. Metal oxides 
were later suggested as alternative interlayers to the PEDOT:PSS which exhibited high 
performance and long lifetimes. However, many of the metal oxide studies reported in 
literature used vacuum deposition methods, such as thermal evaporation and sputter 
deposition, which are not necessarily desirable for large-scale production. 
This thesis shows that it is possible to deposit Vanadium oxide (V2Ox) from solution in 
ambient conditions requiring no post-deposition treatment and achieving comparable 
efficiency to the most widely used interlayer materials. Using a combination of 
spectroscopic techniques and device characterisation, it is shown that solutionprocessed 
V2Ox can be used to replace evaporated metal oxides in optoelectronic 
devices which are fabricated at high temperatures. The work also goes on to show that it 
is possible to solution-process nickel oxide from a nickel acetylacetonate precursor and 
obtain a power conversion efficiency > 5%. Finally, the lifetime study of OPV devices 
utilising various anode interlayer materials shows that the stability of optimised V2Ox 
devices can be comparable with other interlayer materials."
90,,2016.0,Micromechanical Modeling of Oxidation Induced Stresses in SiC/SiC Composites,"Silicon Carbide fiber reinforced composites are used in high temperature aerospace and propulsion applications due to their light weight, increased toughness and high thermal stability. However, their durability is limited due to environmental degradation. This paper focuses on the oxidation of SiC fibers and SiC/SiC composites at high temperature. The constrained volume expansion accompanying oxidation leads to development of large residual volumetric growth stresses. A micromechanical model was used to study the effect of oxidation induced stresses in a SiC fiber and in a unitcell of a SiC/SiC lamina. The oxidation induced strains are estimated by using Pilling- Bedworth expansion ratio and applied to the oxide layer as volumetric strains. The evolution of the oxide layer and stresses during isothermal aging was simulated using finite element methods. Two studies have been conducted considering with intact PyC and eroded PyC interphase regions. Paper describes the stresses developing during oxide growth with linear elastic and visco-elastic oxide layer behaviors. Simulations results are compared with experimental data and predictions from other models obtained from published literature."

 -100.40 %. The relative standard deviation values obtained during precision studies were found to be 
 less than 2. Linearity between concentration and response was found within the specified concentration 
 range and the correlation coefficient was found to be 0.999 for all the drugs. Degradation studies were 
 carried out under various stress conditions such as acid, base, oxidation, heat and light and found no 
 interference of degraded impurity peaks at the retention time of analyte peaks. Hence, the proposed

93,,2017.0,"Removal of Direct Dye using Activated Carbon Prepared from Prosopis juliflora Bark: Isothermal, Thermodynamic and Kinetic Studies","Effluents discharged from textile, paper, rubber, plastics, leather, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food industries have been found to be the main sources of water pollution. Textile industries discharge a lot of wastewaters containing different dyes like direct, reactive, mordant, acid and basic dyes. The direct dyes are the second largest dye class in the color index, which are used for dyeing rayon, linen, cellulosic fibers, wool and silk. Generally, dyes have a relatively low fixation degree on the textile substrate and hence 10-50% of the dye is unexhausted and remains in the dye bath as a waste [1]. These dyes are recalcitrant molecules, which are difficult to degrade biologically [2]. They are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic affecting human beings, fish species and microorganisms. Hence, their removal from wastewaters has become environmentally important [3]. Thus, the removal of dyes from colored effluent of textile industries is of major concern. Various techniques like chemical coagulation [4], electrolysis, chemical oxidation [5], photochemical degradation [6], membrane filtration [7], biological treatment, adsorption by activated carbon [8] are known to be effective for the removal of dyes from polluted water. Amongst, the numerous techniques available for dye removal, adsorption is the procedure of choice giving excellent results as it can be utilized for decolouration of dye effluents [9, 10]. Most commercial systems currently use activated carbon as a sorbent to remove dyes from effluents because of its excellent adsorption ability. However, although activated carbon is a preferred sorbent, its widespread use is restricted due to high cost. In order to decrease the cost of treatment, various attempts have been made to find inexpensive adsorbents. A sorbent can be considered low-cost if it requires little processing, being abundant in nature, a by-product or waste material generated from another industry [11]. Such alternatives include low cost activated carbons prepared from natural products like bagasse [12], nutshells [13], Jute fiber [14], rice husks [15], plum kernels [16] and coconut shells [17]. Activated carbons prepared from various products are widely used as adsorbents due to their high adsorption capacity, large surface area, microporous nature, chemical and thermal stability. In this article, an attempt has been made by Abstract Activated carbon of Prosopis juliflora Bark (PJBAC) is prepared using muffle furnace and employed for the removal of Direct Brown MR (DBMR) dye from aqueous solutions. Surface morphological studies carried out for unloaded and loaded carbons; indicate the surface changes in the porous nature of the dye loaded PJBAC. Batch equilibration experiments pertaining to the study of operating factors viz., varying initial dye concentrations, preset time intervals and different doses of PJBAC, variable pH and temperature environments are verified to assess the sorptive nature of PJBAC. Optimized conditions have been setup as 400 mg/L initial concentration; 60 min contact time; 100 mg dosage, pH 2 and 30 0 C temperature for a maximum of 90.2% dye removal with a sorption capacity of 180.4 mg/g. The isothermal plots for Langmuir, Freundlich and Tempkin equations are tested, wherein the best fit of linearity is observed for both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms, suggesting monolayer/multilayer sorption. Thermodynamic parameters are calculated to study the nature of sorption, observed as endothermic, irreversible and spontaneous for DBMR-PJBAC system. Kinetic studies reveal the applicability of second order kinetic model."

Design: Milk products like chocolate, infant food products, milk based energy drinks, butter etc were examined for the sialic acid content. For Neu5Gc thermal stability studies cow, buffalo, cross cows and processed milk were used. Conclusion: The study indicates the level of sialic acid (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc) in Indian milk and milk based products. Further the stability studies shows degradation (20 to 22 %) of non-human sialic acid (Neu5Gc) to the total sialic acid content."
95,,2008.0,"Increased systemic stability, tumor accumulation and in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a secretory phospholipase 2-degradable liposomal form of cisplatin.","AACR Annual Meeting-- Apr 12-16, 2008; San Diego, CA

5618 

Cisplatin is one of the most potent antitumor agents known, displaying activity against a large number of solid tumors. However, side-effects such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity as well as cellular resistance to the agent mean that this is not a first choice drug in many cancers. An improved drug delivery system which is expected to reduce these side effects is highly desirable. We have designed a liposomal form of cisplatin (LiplaCis) that can be specifically degraded by secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). sPLA2 is often present in tumor tissues, either expressed by the cancerous cells or by infiltrating immune cells thereby assuring a site-specific release in the tumor micro-environment. The specificity of sPLA2-mediated release was demonstrated in vitro with cells highly resistant to LiplaCis in the absence of sPLA2. In contrast, in the presence of sPLA2 the IC50 values are lower than for free cisplatin which is due to a simultaneous release of lysolipids from the liposomes. In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments in rats and mice show an increased stability in plasma and the effect is present after >14 days. Xenograft studies in nude mice using the mouse mammary carcinoma tumor model MT-3, the mouse colon carcinoma CT-26 or the human colon carcinoma Colo205 revealed long-lasting tumor accumulation of LiplaCis within hours after administration. Efficacy studies using the MT-3 -model showed improved tumor elimination compared to the free drug with similar toxicity. Thus, LiplaCis is expected to perform better than free cisplatin in the clinic and phase one studies will be initiated in early 2008."
96,10.3109/03639045.2010.535823,2011.0,Early development evaluation of AZD8081: a substrate for the NK receptors,"The purpose of the present study was to find out if AZD8081, a dual neurokinin (NK)1/2 receptor antagonist, was suitable for development of an oral, solid immediate release (IR) formulation and in a further perspective also as an oral extended release (ER) formulation. AZD8081 is a base with pKa values <2.5 and about 8.5. The measured intrinsic solubility is about 0.1 mg/mL and the solubility in FaSSIF (fasted simulated small intestinal fluid) is about 3.2 mg/mL. Aqueous buffer solutions are stable for at least 1 month between pH 1–7 up to 37°C. In the solid-state, a mixture of amorphous and crystalline substance showed significant chemical instability in the initial stress testing studies. No degradation was, however, observed for highly crystalline material at similar conditions. It is concluded that the impurity profile and/or the present solid-state of the batches affect the stability of the substance. The amorphous contribution of the substance is the main cause to the observed degradation in solid-state. Crystalline AZD8081 is polymorphic with two known monotropic forms, form A and form B. Both forms are only slightly hygroscopic ansolvates with melting points of approximately 108°C and 117°C, respectively. Form B is the more stable of the two forms and is therefore most suited for further development. The candidate is suitable for development of standard IR formulations since no specific limitations of significance for formulation development were identified. In addition, the good stability in human intestinal fluid and in colon slurry makes AZD8081 a suitable candidate for ER formulation."

Consequently, understanding device lifetime and mitigating degradation pathways have become vital to the success of a new industry. Historically, the active organic components are considered vulnerable to photo-oxidation and represent the primary degradation channel. We present several (shelf life and light soaking) studies pointing to the relative stability of the active layers and instabilities in commonly used electrode materials.

98,10.18520/CS/V107/I9/1377-1379,2014.0,A case of polymer photovoltaics in India,"Polymer solar cells are light weight, flexible and inexpensive. There has been great progress in three important aspects of polymer solar cells in the last decade, i.e. efficiency, stability and processing. The efficiencies of single-junction solar cells have been improved by stacking two or more complementary single cells in the form of tandem cells. There has been tremendous progress in roll-to-roll processing of single and tandem cells resulting in the setting up 1 GW solar power parks in Denmark and south of Spain. India has an ambitious programme of setting up solar energy power houses up to 300 GW by 2030. However, subcritical research and development is taking place in the field of polymer solar cells in India. It is high time we decide to pursue intensive polymer photovoltaics in the country. Following the commentary by Bose, I discuss here polymer photovoltaics in India. The progress in polymer photovoltaics has no parallel in any technological growth in the world. Polymer solar cells being light weight, flexible and inexpensive can be produced by cheap low-temperature solution processing. Three important aspects of polymer solar cells, i.e. efficiency, stability and processing have shown tremendous progress. Tang reported the first polymer solar cell in 1986 using bilayer structure demonstrating a power conversion efficiency of 1%. The last decade witnessed the impressive development in bulk heterojunction concept in polymer solar cell technology leading to the increase in single-junction cell efficiency from 4% in 2005 (refs 8 and 9) to state-of-the-art present-day efficiencies of 8–9% (refs 10–15; Figure 1). By optimization of materials with proper band gap (necessarily low band gap), energy levels and carrier mobility, efficiencies up to 10–12% are achievable in single-junction solar cells. The organic tandem solar cells comprising two series-connected single cells and covering complementary solar spectra can reach theoretical Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of 15% (refs 17 and 18). You et al. have demonstrated an efficiency of 10.6% in solution-processed tandem cells (Figure 2). Heliatek Co, Germany has recently demonstrated certified 12% efficiency in a vacuumprocessed small-molecule organic triplejunction device with an active area of > 1 cm. There has been remarkable progress in the stability of bulk heterojunction solar cells in the last ten years. There are various degradation phenomena taking place in polymer solar cells. When the device is illuminated, complex chemical reactions of organic semiconductors with oxygen and moisture have been observed. Similarly, interface is another source of degradation. The diffusion of the electrode materials into an active layer, acidity of the poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)– polystyrene-para-sulfonic acid (PEDOT : PSS) layer and change of morphology of active layer are some reasons for the degradation of polymer solar cells. These instabilities can be significantly reduced by appropriate encapsulation. Flexible poly(3-hexyl thiophene) : (6,6)-phenylC61-butyric methyl ester) (P3HT : PC61BM), organic photovoltaics (OPV) devices encapsulated with food-quality packaging barrier film have shown a lifetime over 1200 h. Where a higher quality barrier film was used, lifetimes of 4000 h (at 65C/85% relative humidity) have been achieved. Peters et al. recently reported a lifetime of 7 years for poly[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl2,5-thiophenediyl]–(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric methyl-ester (PCDTBT–PCBM) solar cells. An inter-laboratory outdoor stability study of flexible roll-to-roll coated organic photovoltaic modules (P3HT : PCBM inverted architecture) in different geographical locations from the southern and northern hemispheres has been undertaken. The most stable modules have demonstrated lifetime of more than 10,000 h and sub-cell analyses revealed stability of up to 17 months. Development has also taken place in the processing of polymer solar cells resulting in the setting up 1 GW solar power parks in southern Spain and Denmark. Spin coating is the most popular method in OPV device fabrication in research laboratories. Various printing and coating techniques have been found compatible to fast roll-to-roll processing. In the past it was confined to single donor– acceptor polymer solar cells. Frederic Krebs and his research team at the Technical University of Denmark have demonstrated for the first time the successful roll-to-roll manufacture of tandem OPV modules, each comprised of a stack of 14 discrete layers which are rapidly printed, coated or deposited on top of another by a machine reminiscent of a printing press (Figure 3). The processing was carried out under simple conditions; it is very fast with single solar cell module being printed onto blank foil each second. The whole processing is cheap"
99,10.1002/POLA.24742,2011.0,Novel macrothiols for the synthesis of a structurally comprehensive dendritic library using thiol–ene click chemistry,"In the last decades, the fabrication of ordered nano- and microporous structures has attracted increasing interest due to their specific properties and multiple possible applications in electronics, as templates or in the biological field. The development of such materials has been favored by the introduction of the simple breath-figure templating method in the 1990’s. In order to fully exploit the potential of these porous materials, the use of advanced functional molecules as precursors is essential. One suitable class of molecules is the well-defined linear-dendritic hybrids (LD hybrids) family. The structural variations, multiple end-groups and possible amphiphilicity of these molecules are significant advantages that could lead to highly sophisticated functional materials with potential usage in biology. Therefore, this project was directed towards the synthesis of advanced LD hybrids and the evaluation of their ability to form ordered functional porous films.A degradation and toxicity study was initially conducted on polyester-based 2,2-bis(methylol)propionic acid (bis-MPA) dendrimers under physiological conditions to support the potential usage of these molecules for biological purposes. The materials were found to undergo a relatively fast depolymerization process at pH 7.5. Moreover, the initial dendrimer and its decomposition products were proven to be non-toxic for immune competent cells, allowing for the utilization of these molecules for biological applications.A linear-dendritic-linear hybrid library was successfully synthesized from biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and bis-MPA building blocks using a combination of ring-opening polymerization (ROP)and copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). The materials, consisting of one long PEG block connected to the focal point of the dendron and several PCL arms attached at its periphery, were used to construct ordered porous films using the breath figure method. The polymeric architecture strongly affected the ordering of the films with a more regular morphology obtained from a more flexible polymer. Changing the semi-crystalline PCL to amorphous polylactide (PLA) also permitted the formation of porous arrays. Interestingly, films obtained from inverted structures possessing one long PCL block and several short PEG chains, also presented a regular morphology. Moreover they could be activated to exhibit multiple surface hydroxyl groups.To increase the number of orthogonal synthetic methodologies available for the preparation of advanced macromolecules, high molecular weight dendritic macrothiols were synthesized. These molecules were efficiently coupled to a number of core molecules via thiol-ene coupling, generating a comprehensive library of dendritic materials. This approach represents an attractive alternative to the commonly used, but potentially toxic, CuAAC.Exploiting the obtained results, a final LD hybrid was synthesized from atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) derivatives and thiol-ene coupling (TEC) with macrothiols. This macromolecule was successfully utilized to form functional ordered porous arrays and the availability of peripheral alkyne functional groups was demonstrated by efficient coupling with fluorescent Rhodamine-B. The HEMA-backbone allowed for the introduction of cross-linkable azide groups that were used to significantly improve the thermal stability of the films from 50 °C to 200 °C. These materials have the potential to be used in applications such as catalysis, in medicine and as sensors."

The performance of these biomaterials can be greatly enhanced through the incorporation of bioactive agents. For this reason, we developed chitosan films with cell-attachment ability, rhBMP-2 carrier capacity, and good in vivo performance, and we employ them as covering for implantable materials. In this work, we have tried to explain how the rh-BMP2 is delivered to the surroundings from the development chitosan films. Protein diffusion from film, film stability versus in vitro dissolution, and biodegradation were evaluated to study rhBMP-2 delivery. Our results show that chitosan film has sufficiently good features to be used as an rhBMP-2 carrier. A low diffusion rate was observed, which was sufficient to quickly induce an in vitro differentiation stimulus, although heavily activated films retain more than 80-85% of the protein on the film. On the other hand, we estimated that chitosan film dissolution due to initial acidification in the wound environment is no more than 15-20%. We also estimated chitosan film response to lysozyme and concluded that degradation via this process proceeded at a slow kinetic rate. In addition, rhBMP-2 in vitro activity after film processing, as well as in vivo film behavior, were studied. We confirm that rhBMP-2 remains active on the film and after release, both in vitro and in vivo. These results support the conclusion that the developed chitosan film allows sustained release of the rhBMP-2 osteoinductive protein and could be used as an activated coat for implant and surgical prosthesis."
101,,2015.0,Síntesis y caracterización de las capas interfaciales en las celdas solares orgánicas,"The quest for renewable energy sources has led to growing attention in the research of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), as a promising alternative to fossil fuels, since these devices have low manufacturing costs and attractive end-user qualities, such as ease of installation and maintenance. Wide application of OPVs is majorly limited by the devices lifetime. With the development of new encapsulation materials, some degradation factors, such as water and oxygen ingress, can almost be excluded, whereas the thermal degradation of the devices remains a major issue. Two aspects have to be addressed to solve the problem of thermal instability: bulk effects in the photoactive layer and interfacial effects at the photoactive layer/charge-transporting layers. 
In this work, the interface between photoactive layer and electron-transporting zinc oxide (ZnO) in devices with inverted architecture was engineered by introducing polymeric interlayers, based on zinc-binding ligands, such as 3,4-dihydroxybenzene and 8-hydroxyquinoline.

At first, controlled reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation was employed to achieve well-defined polymers in a range of molar masses, all bearing a chain-end functionality for further modifications. Resulting polymers have been fully characterised, including their thermal and optical properties, and introduced as interlayers to study their effect on the initial device performance and thermal stability.

103,,2011.0,O 2 . 2 Bacterial members of HtrA serine proteases family – important virulence factors and interesting models for structural studies,"The existence of a proteolytic system which can specifically recognize and cleave proteins in mitochondria is now well established. Components of this system comprise processing peptidases, ATP-dependent peptidases, and oligopeptidases. Processing peptidases mediate limited proteolysis while ATP-dependent proteases and oligopeptidases, working sequentially, are able to degrade proteins to amino acids.Three families of ATP-dependent proteases have been identified in plant mitochondria: Lon, Clp and FtsH. All members of these families have two domains, a homologous ATPase domain also termed AAA domain, with several conserved motifs including those necessary for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and a family specific proteolytic domain. FtsH proteases, also termed AAA peptidases or triple A peptidases, are ATP-dependent metalloproteases. They form high-molecular mass complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Recently, we demonstrated that their expression can be regulated at translational level. Generally, it is thought that triple A proteases control quality and quantity of membrane mitochondrial proteins and therefore they are important for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. The best characterized plant mitochondrial triple A protease is Arabidopsis FtsH4, whose catalytic site is exposed to the intermembrane space. Observations of Arabidopsis mutants lacking AtFtsH4 have revealed a pleiotropic phenotype including a germination delay, seedling establishment delay, alternation in leaf shape and inhibition of reproductive development. The germination delay was observed independently of conditions while the remaining phenotypic changes are conditional. We have proved the significance of the chaperone-like activity of AtFtsH4 for the assembly/stability of the oxidative phosphorylation system. We postulate that one of function of AtFtsH4 is to prevent accumulation of oxidized proteins under condition favorable for their accumulation as in ageing plants. Given the dual nature of FtsH as a protease and chaperone, AtFtsH4 can control the level of oxidized proteins by degrading them and/or decreasing the pool of unassembled subunits which undergo oxidation easily.

104,10.1021/BC980033S,1999.0,Closo-dodecaborate(2-) as a linker for iodination of macromolecules. Aspects on conjugation chemistry and biodistribution.,"Boron-containing compounds like closo-dodecaborate(2-) are in theory suitable for radioactive labeling with halogens. The boron-halogen bond is stronger than carbon-halogen bond and is not likely to be recognized by deiodinating enzymes in vivo. Peptides and proteins may be conjugated with various closo-dodecaborate(2-)-containing ligands, and thereafter, the conjugate can be iodinated. Since closo-dodecaborate(2-) is more avidly iodinated than tyrosine in moderately acidic media, such conjugates may be directly labeled on the boron part with radioisotopes of iodine using the standard Chloramine-T procedure. Mercapto-undecahydro-closo-dodecaborate(2-) (BSH) was reacted with the double bond of allyldextran to form a boronated dextran compound of the molecular size of about 70 kDa. This compound, in the text denoted as Dx-BS, and cesium dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate(2-) were labeled using iodine-125. The two compounds were administered to rats in order to study their in vivo stability. The results indicate that iodinated Dx-BS is stable for about 20 h in vivo. The degradation rate, as indicated by thyroid uptake, was found low. [125I]Iodo-closo-dodecaborate(2-), which is a possible degradation product of [125I]Dx-BS-I, was rapidly excreted in urine without significant accumulation in any organ."
105,,2010.0,A Novel Approach for Efficient Utilization of Cotton into Nonwovens,"Smart textiles integrated with fiber shaped photovoltaic (PV) device could be used as a sustainable and ubiquitous power source for wearable and other electronic devices. In this study, effects of fabric structures on power conversion efficiency of PV fabrics were investigated. Three different PV fabrics were constructed: plain, 1⁄4 twill and 5 harness sateen on tapestry loom. Light and dark I-V characteristics of these PV fabrics were determined, to compare the performance of different PV fabrics. INTRODUCTION Fiber shaped organic photovoltaic (OPV) wires are the potential candidates for smart PV fabric applications because of their flexibility and weavability. The fiber shaped OPV wires are still in its infant stage and the efficiency of these wires is still lower than <1% [1,2] as compared to 5% of their flat organic counterpart. The OPV fiber (Konarka Technologies, Inc., Lowell, MA) is a flexible wire shaped PV cell based on nanostructure bulk heterojunction composites [3]. A phase separated, OPV layer, comprises of conductive polymer poly (3hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor material and fullerene derivative, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor material. The OPV layer is coated onto a thin metal primary electrode (cathode) wire made of stainless steel. A second wire, serve as a secondary electrode (anode), made of stainless steel wire coated with silver particles [3]. The electrical contacts between the two wires are established by wrapping secondary electrode wire around the PV coated primary electrode wire [3]. The two wire system is then encased into protective transparent outer polymer cladding. Experimental OPV fiber was obtained in spool form and stored in a controlled environment. PV fabric samples were woven on Mirrix Zach Tapestry Loom (Mirrix Tapestry & Bead Looms, Francestown, NH) with three different fabric structures, i.e. plain, 1⁄4 twill and 5 harness sateen weave, and with the following specifications: fabric length 5.08 cm, fabric width 10.16 cm, epcm 15.74 cm, ppcm 6.3. For warp, 30 Tex white polyester yarn was used and for weft, three picks of OPV fibers were weaved after every five picks of polyester yarn. The crimp in the OPV fiber was measured using the crimp tester (ASTM D 3883). We connected serially four sets of three picks/set of OPV fiber to make PV woven panel. The light I-V characteristics of PV woven panels were determined on solar I-V tester, ORIEL 6271 (Newport Corporation, Stratford, CT) equipped with AM 1.5 filter. The irradiance from the solar I-V tester was set at 100 mW/cm. The dark I-V characteristics were determined using reversed biased I-V measurement. The voltage is sourced (KEITHLEY 617 programmable electrometer) from 0 V to a voltage level where the device begins to break down. The resulting current is measured and plotted as a function of the applied voltage. The projected area of the OPV fiber was taken as its length multiplied by the diameter of the primary electrode wire, i.e. 0.01016 cm. Various PV parameters were determined from the I-V characteristic curves, i.e. maximum power point, fill factor and power conversion efficiency [4]. Eq. (1), (2) and (3) shows the maximum power, fill factor and power conversion efficiency calculation. Maximum Power Pmax = Vmax*Imax (1) Fill Factor FF = (Vmax*Imax)/(Voc*Isc) (2) Efficiency % = Pmax/Pin*100 (3) RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crimp in the yarn was measured by taking out three picks of OPV fiber (length 30.48 cm) and then straightens the OPV fiber such that there is no waviness present in the fiber. The percentage excess length of OPV fiber over the initial length is expressed in terms of crimp values. Table I show the crimp values for different PV fabrics. TABLE I: Crimp values for different PV fabrics. Fabric Initial Length Final Length Crimp Plain PV fabric 30.48 cm 32.30 cm 6.0% 1⁄4 twill PV fabric 30.48 cm 31.54 cm 3.5% 5 harness sateen PV fabric 30.48 cm 31.39 cm 3.0% The light I-V characteristics of 30.48 cm long OPV fiber and different PV woven panels consisting of 129.2 cm (plain)126.16 cm (1/4 twill) – 125.56 cm (5 harness sateen) long OPV fiber were determined and shown in figure 1 and 2. Table II shows various photovoltaic parameters for OPV fiber and PV fabrics calculated from light I-V characteristic curves. From Table II we can see that the efficiency of OPV fiber is ~0.96% as compared to ~3.0% for same fiber reported by Lee et al [5]. Lee at el reported ~3.0% efficiency for freshly prepared OPV fiber, but the OPV fiber we tested is already 1 year old and the PV layer has been degraded likely due to the inadequate barrier properties of the polymer cladding to moisture and oxygen. Very little information is available regarding stability of the OPV fiber at this time. FIGURE 1: IV characteristic curve of OPV fiber. FIGURE 2: IV characteristic curves for different PV fabrics TABLE II: Photovoltaic parameters for OPV fiber and PV fabrics.

Moreover, within the different PV fabrics, we see variations in the efficiency value and is maximum for 5 harness sateen PV fabric, i.e. 0.32% and minimum for plain PV fabric, i.e. 0.23%, whereas for 1⁄4 twill PV fabric, it lies in between, i.e. 0.28%. This lower efficiency in case of PV fabrics as compared to individual OPV fiber is due to the shadowing of parts of the OPV fibers and due to several resistive losses, i.e. losses due to electrical connections, resistive losses due to the stainless steel wire substrate and electrical contacts between the two electrode wire. The dark I-V measurements for 30.48 cm long OPV fiber and different PV woven panels were carried out to determine the diode properties and different PV parameters. In order to determine these parameters, the dark I-V characteristics were plotted on semi log scale and the curve is divided into three regimes [5]: I. At low positively biased voltage, the parallel resistance Rp, limits the current through an OPV cell. II. At moderate bias voltage, current through an OPV cell is controlled by the diode properties. III. At higher voltage, the series resistance Rs, limits the current through an OPV cell. The dark I-V characteristic results show that the different fabric structures affects the series resistance of the OPV fiber. Series resistance is maximum in case of plain PV fabric (1184 Ω) and is minimum in case of 5 harness sateen (318 Ω). This is because of the following reasons: the crimp in the yarn (TABLE I) that leads to extra length of OPV fiber per pick, the bending of OPV fiber at the point of interlacement may disturbed the electrical contact points between the two electrodes and the shadowing of textile yarns on the OPV fiber.

The experimental results suggests that 5 harness sateen woven PV fabrics gives better efficiency as compared to 1⁄4 twill and plain woven PV fabrics. FUTURE WORK PV fabric geometrical model will be developed to understand the effects of fabric structures on power conversion efficiency of the PV fabrics. The model will help in optimizing PV fabric performance and predicts the performance of PV fabric with different shape, size and structure.

 Analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by multiparameter immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy allows non-invasive characterization of cancer cell biomarker expression in real time. This information can be helpful in prognosis, treatment selection, and stratification of cancer patients. AccuCyte® is a density-based unbiased isolation method that transfers nucleated cells from whole blood to slides for the characterization of CTCs and other rare cells. RarePlex® panel kits are IF staining reagents used on automated slide staining instruments to label cells to differentiate CTCs from white blood cells (WBC). CyteFinder® is a seven-channel automated fluorescent imaging system that rapidly scans microscope slides and applies machine learning algorithms to identify CTCs. Together, these technologies provide an end-to-end solution for CTC characterization. For analysis, blood is drawn into AccuCyte blood collection tubes (BCTs) containing a preservative which maintains cell properties prior to processing onto slides. Once slides are prepared, they can be stored at -20°C without significant biomarker degradation. This flexible workflow allows investigators to bank samples for batch analysis and to begin sample collection prior to validating the IF assay to be used. This study was designed to evaluate: (1) stability time between collection in the AccuCyte BCT and sample processing; (2) performance of an improved version of the AccuCyte kit with higher nucleated cell isolation capacity; and (3) storage time that AccuCyte prepared slides can be banked frozen prior to staining. The study was performed using model CTCs and cancer patient samples. Metrics to determine performance were CTC recovery and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of biomarker expression. Our results demonstrate that the AccuCyte BCT preserves blood components for at least 5 days after collection without significant effect on CTC recovery or biomarker expression. The latest version of the AccuCyte kit demonstrated a higher cell isolation capacity and could collect up to 60% more nucleated blood cells than the previous version, increasing CTC recovery. The increased capacity was demonstrated in patients treated with hematopoietic growth factors, whose WBC count was significantly higher than the normal range. Finally, accelerated-aging study results demonstrated that AccuCyte-prepared slides can be stored at -20°C for at least 4 years without significant effect on most biomarkers tested. In conclusion, enhancements to the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform reported here increase flexibility and performance for analysis of CTCs in global clinical trials by allowing longer periods of time before collected blood samples need to be processed and by extending the length of time processed slides can be banked before they are stained.

107,10.1002/jctb.6345,2020.0,Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) purification through dilute aqueous ammonia digestion at elevated temperatures,"BACKGROUND: Purification of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is a challenging step, given the difficulty of achieving high PHA purity, while maintaining polymer integrity, in a sustainable and cost‐efficient manner. This study evaluated the potential of dilute ammonia digestion as a method to purify PHA from mixed microbial consortia. RESULTS: Digestion temperatures were critical to the obtainable purity and the amount of recovered PHA. At temperatures below 75 °C (regardless of the incubation time and ammonia concentration), a low PHA recovery (down to 65%) and no increase in purity was observed. By increasing the temperature above 75 °C, a significantly higher PHA purity and higher recovery (above 90%) could be achieved. Temperatures maximizing the purity (140 °C) led to a detrimental reduction in the molar mass of the isolated PHA, but the use of a sonication pre‐treatment enabled to increase the purity at temperatures leading to limited molar mass loss (75–115 °C). The impurities still present in the recovered PHA did not compromise its thermal stability, and no significant degradation occurred during melting of PHA with 86% purity (comparably to pure chloroform‐extracted PHA). Conversely, PHA recovered through sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) digestion underwent severe degradation during melting, despite presenting higher purity (98%). CONCLUSIONS: High PHA purity, recovery and thermal stability can be obtained with dilute ammonia digestion. These observations, combined with the possibility of reusing ammonia within the process, make this method a promising approach for a more sustainable purification of PHA. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry"
108,10.2527/1999.7792428X,1999.0,Combined effect of epinephrine and exercise on calpain/calpastatin and cathepsin B and L activity in porcine longissimus muscle.,"The objective of the study was to improve the understanding of the relationship between the effect of epinephrine plus exercise and meat tenderness. The calpain, calpastatin, and cathepsin B + L activities and postmortem proteolysis in porcine longissimus muscle were studied. The muscle glycogen stores were depleted in five pigs by s.c. injection of epinephrine (.3 mg/kg) at 15 h antemortem and exercise on a treadmill (5 min, 3.8 km/h) immediately before slaughter. Antemortem injection of epinephrine and treadmill exercise resulted in higher ultimate pH (6.32 vs 5.66 in control) and decreased (P < .05) thaw loss, cooking loss, and shear force values. The muscle energy depletion treatment increased (P < .05) the muscle mu-calpain activity measured 42 min postmortem, and at 24 h mu-calpain activity was still approximately 50% greater in the high ultimate pH group. Also, as the ratio of mu-calpain to calpastatin increased (P < .01), the overall proteolytic potential of the calpain system were greater. These observations suggest that the muscle energy level may influence the activity of the calpain system in the living animal. The high ultimate pH group showed lower (P < .001) cathepsin B + L activity in the myofibrillar and the soluble fractions after 8 d of storage, suggesting that the increased ultimate pH increased the stability of the lysosomal membrane and thereby reduced the release of cathepsins from the lysosomes during storage. The SDS-PAGE showed increased (P < .001) degradation of a 39-kDa band in the epinephrine and exercise-treated samples. Degradation products at 30, 31, and 32 kDa were labeled by troponin-T antibody in western blot. An appearing 24-kDa band was identified as a troponin-I degradation product in western blot. The proteolytic degradation pattern of myofibrillar proteins during storage differed in control and treated samples, supporting the hypothesis that calpain-mediated proteolysis was affected after treatment, resulting in meat with high ultimate pH."
109,,2016.0,Abstract 19: Role of Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing of Alu Elements in Human Vascular Inflammatory Diseases,"Background: Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is catalysed by ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) and is an important posttranscriptional regulator of RNA metabolism. Although RNA editing is essential for life, its role in cardiovascular disease is unknown. Methods and Results: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of human endothelial cells revealed that ADAR1 is the main RNA editor in HUVECs. The vast majority of editing events are detected in Alu regions due to their ability to form double-stranded structures, a prerequisite for RNA editing. A-to-I RNA editing of the primate-specific Alu elements is observed in 25% of poly(A)+ transcripts and in 44% of ribosomal RNA-depleted transcripts. Cathepsin S (CTSS), an extracellular matrix degrading enzyme, has 3 Alu elements in its 3’-untranslated region and is among the most extensively edited mRNAs. Interestingly, ADAR1 silencing downregulates CTSS mRNA expression, whereas ADAR1 overexpression results in an increase of both CTSS RNA editing rate and CTSS mRNA expression. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), luciferase reporter and iCLIP assays showed that A-to-I RNA editing of the Alu elements in the 3’UTR of CTSS mRNA regulates the recruitment of the stabilizing RNA-binding protein HuR to CTSS 3’UTR and, thus, controls CTSS mRNA stability and expression. CTSS Alu RNA editing is increased under hypoxic or pro-inflammatory conditions in vitro , as well as in patients with coronary or carotid atherosclerotic vascular disease. Further, the extent of CTSS Alu RNA editing rate correlated with various markers of subclinical atherosclerosis including intima-media thickness and number of atherosclerotic plaques. Importantly, ADAR1 and the extent of CTSS RNA editing correlated with CTSS expression levels in patients’ samples from 6 non-overlapping cohorts of patients with inflammatory vascular diseases (total n=366), including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, carotid atherosclerotic plaques and thoracic aortic aneurysms. Conclusion: This study shows for the first time that Alu A-to-I RNA editing is a critical modulator of inflammatory gene expression in all stages of atherosclerotic vascular disease development."

The i-leader contains an open translational reading frame for a hypothetical protein of Mr about 16,600, and a 16,000-Mr polypeptide (16K protein) has been translated in vitro on mRNA selected with DNA containing the i-leader (A. Virtanen, P. Aleström, H. Persson, M. G. Katze, and U. Pettersson, Nucleic Acids Res. 10:2539-2548, 1982). To determine whether the i-leader protein is synthesized during productive infection and to provide an immunological reagent to study the properties and functions of the i-leader protein, we prepared antipeptide antibodies directed to a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide which is encoded near the N terminus of the hypothetical i-leader protein and contains a high acidic amino acid and proline content. Antipeptide antibodies immunoprecipitated from extracts of adenovirus type 2-infected cells a major 16K protein that comigrated with a 16K protein translated in vitro. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis by Edman degradation of radiolabeled 16K antigen showed that methionine is present at residue 1 and leucine is present at residues 8 and 10, as predicted from the DNA sequence, establishing that the 16K protein precipitated by this antibody is indeed the i-leader protein. Thus, the i-leader protein is a prominent species that is synthesized during productive infection. The i-leader protein is often seen as a doublet on polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that either two related forms of i-leader protein are synthesized in infected cells or that a posttranslational modification occurs. Time course studies using immunoprecipitation analysis with antipeptide antibodies revealed that the E1A 289R T antigen and the E1B-19K (175R) T antigen are synthesized beginning at 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 h postinfection, respectively, whereas the i-leader protein is synthesized starting at about 8 h postinfection and continues unabated until at least 25 h postinfection. The i-leader protein is very stable, as determined by pulse-chase labeling experiments, and accumulates continuously from 8 to 25 h postinfection, as shown by immunoblot analysis. The synthesis of i-leader protein does not depend upon viral DNA replication. Thus, the i-leader protein is a viral gene product of unknown function and high stability that is made in large quantities at intermediate times of productive infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
111,,2012.0,Interpenetrating polymer network of chitosan crosslinked silicone as medical implants,"Introduction Adherence of bacteria, named as bacterial colonisation on medical implant surface is the first step in the outbreak of implant-related infections. Bacterial colonisation has many different growth and survival strategy. One such type of colonisation is microbial biofilm formation, which is notably a risk full factor when takes place on the surface of inserted implants. These bacteria infect the patients by producing an extensive exopolysaccharide,‘glycocalyces’. Often in combination with derivatives from the host environment, the glycocalyces form a confluent protected biofilm on tissues and implanted materials.Rapidly dividing bacteria can spread along the surface of a device within the glycocalyx of the biofilm. Some of the surface bacteria can be shed and become free to attach to a new, non-colonised surface. For deriving nutrients and to counter cationic antimicrobial agents, an ion exchange matrix is formed within the biofilm. The biofilm structure also facilitates the interaction between different bacteria. The interaction of bacteria results in co-operative activities, like cross-feeding, and promoting genetic exchange and resistance transfer.Bacteria covered by biofilm can be more resistant to antimicrobial agents even at high concentration. This makes serious complications in treatment of implant related infections [1] . Catheter related infections are more frequent in postoperative stages of patients. Because of the size, shape and ambient environment, the biofilm formation is quite faster in implanted catheters both the outer and luminal wall of the device. A site specific active antimicrobial agent administered at high concentration can increase the success of antimicrobial chemotherapy Medical devices range from easily inserted and retrieved contact lenses, urinary catheters and endotracheal tubes to surgically implanted cardiac valves, hip joints and coronary stents [2] .Since silicone has been used successfully in many health care applications, it is tacitly understood that silicone materials are intrinsically biocompatible for preparing medical implants. Medical silicone materials, including fluids, gels, elastomers, and adhesives, are used extensively in medical field because it possess an appropriate host response at specific situations in patients. Silicone’s biodurability in medical applications is probably related to its exceptional thermal and chemical stability properties. Silicones remain essentially unaffected by repeated sterilization by autoclaving, and they can usually be dry heat sterilized as well. Silicones can also be formulated into other biomaterials, such as polyurethane, to enhance their biodurability [3] . Gaining resistance to antimicrobials is a major concern worldwide. Releasing antimicrobials at sub-inhibitory concentration to the surrounding tissues or fluids can induce resistance in infecting bacteria [4] . Both antibiotics and antiseptics are used to combat bacterial infections. However, bacterial resistance develops much less readily to antiseptics than to antibiotics [5] . Materials and Methods  Sample collection Urinary catheters made up of silicone are the chief research material of this study. These materials are collected from the Coimbatore Government Hospital, Coimbatore, India and coated with chitosan and a drug carrier, poly DL-lactic acid (PDLLA) using dip coating procedure [6] . Medical grade chitosan was AB STRACT Medical implants the most unavoidable medical device of nowadays has many potent advantages. One of the important limitations of it in medical usage is colonization of biofilm formers on the inner surface of the implants and produce high risk for the implantable material. This study involves the evaluation of one such high rate biofilm forming bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis which prevail in the blood. The research materials silicone used for making catheters and stents was coated with chitosan and crosslinked using polyD,L lactic acid (PDLLA) to provide anti-bacterial activity. This was achieved through a dip coating procedure. The bioefficacy against S. epidermidis, water absorbing ability, withstanding lysozyme degradation and biocompatibility analysis were done to understand whether the coated catheters can be more advantageous than the usual one used in hospitals normally. All the analysis showed more compatible result for the chitosan-PDLLA coated catheter samples. The bioefficacy effect of the dip coated catheters and its ability to eradicate the biofilm formation on the surface designated the modified silicone catheters as efficient implants."
112,,2012.0,N-INNER Final Scientific Report Project: Evaluation platform for polymer solar cells – Morphoso,"The objective of the project entitled “Morphoso” was to establish an evaluation platform for polymer solar cells in order to combine different approaches such as modeling, processing and characterization of devices with the aim to find both theoretical and experimental correlations between the thin film processes, the nanomorphology of the photoactive blend layer and the resulting generation, transport and recombination of charge carriers in organic solar cells. Synergies between the three project partners were used to achieve a better understanding of the fundamental processes taking place when operating an organic solar cell. Solar cells were built with different materials in all three labs and standard configurations were defined. To enhance absorption light trapping structures on the mmand the μm-scale were employed and their potential was determined. 3D-tomography was applied to visualize the morphology of the donor/acceptor network. Electrical modeling was performed with a continuum approach and a 2D heterojunction model was developed during the three years project time. Different experimental techniques like photoinduced absorption and CELIV (current extraction through linear increasing voltage) were used extensively to probe the generation and recombination of charge carriers as well as their transport through the photoactive layer. Last but not least the long term stability of different cell geometries was investigated and proper encapsulation materials and techniques were identified. In addition to these ageing experiments unsealed cells were exposed to oxygen or water vapor when illuminated in order to learn more about the specific degradation mechanisms. N-INNER final scientific report – Project: Evaluation platform for polymeric solar cells Morphoso IV Executive Summary Organic solar cells or organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a comparably young technology which attracted a lot of interest both from the scientific community and industry in the last years. This is on the one side due to the fact that it is relatively easy and cheap to start with research on organic solar cells as compared to their inorganic counterparts. On the other side, it is known since many years that this technology has one of the greatest potential for low costs among the next generation PV technologies. The reason is that organic solar cells can be processed at room temperature from solution with different printing techniques. High temperatures are not required which enables the use of flexible substrates (foils) and thus continuous processing with roll-to-roll technology becomes possible. Continuous roll-to-roll processing allows reaching very large throughput rates which translates directly into very low production costs. By intensive research the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells could be increased up to values of more than 9% using a nanoscale interpenetrating network of two materials, a donor and an acceptor. Although this new solar cell technology promises very low production costs there are still major tasks to be worked upon for providing solar electricity on a larger scale. For a technology breakthrough, the basic understanding of the fundamental processes in organic PV is necessary. This is anything but trivial to obtain due to the fact that the elementary processes take place on 120 nm scales within time frames from picoseconds to milliseconds. In addition, all this happens in disordered materials which are more difficult to describe on a quantitative manner than well-ordered, crystalline materials. The project “Morphoso” intended to make a contribution to the improvement in understanding the underlying processes which eventually determine the power output of solution-processed organic solar cells. The project consortium consisted of three partners from the three countries Sweden, Finland and Germany. The partners were a) The group “Biomolecular and Organic Electronics” led by Prof. Olle Inganäs at the Department of Physics at Linköping University in Sweden b) The group “Organic Electronics” from Prof. Ronald Österbacka at the Department of Physics and Centre for Functional Materials of the Åbo Akademi University (University of Turku) in Finland c) The group “Dye and organic Solar Cells” headed by Dr. Uli Würfel at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Freiburg, Germany The overall aim of the project consortium was to enhance the understanding of the physical processes taking place in solution-processed organic solar cells and contribute to the process of setting the basis for future improvements and thus pushing organic photovoltaics closer to real applications. We are all convinced that an enduring progress in this field can only be achieved when practical efforts and academic insights are combined in a proper way. Therefore we put the expertises of the three partners together and exchanged our – sometimes differing point of views in intensive scientific discussions. This was done either at one of the project meetings which took place regularly at one of the partners’ institutions or at international conferences where we met each other. The exchange of ideas among the researchers of our three-national project consortium was regarded as something extremely valuable by all people contributing to the project. Another aspect was that this way people got to know each other and set the basis for some shorter and longer stays in the group of one of the other consortium members. These visits allowed for more and prolonged discussions about the interpretation of experimental data and the most appropriate theoretical description of the underlying processes. In inorganic crystalline materials used as photoactive material for solar cells the absorption of a photon leads directly to the generation of free charge carriers, an electron and a hole. Although an electron and a hole are also created upon absorption of a photon in the photoactive layer of an organic solar cell they experience a strong binding energy in the range of ca. 0.5eV. This quasi-particle is called an exciton and as it is electrically neutral its transport is governed by diffusion. The thermal energy at temperatures around room temperature (or even at higher temperatures a solar cell would reach on a roof top, i.e. ≤ 85°C) is not enough to overcome this binding energy. Therefore a second component is present in the photoactive layer which offers a lower lying energy level for the electron which is called the acceptor. The exciton has to reach the interface between donor and acceptor within its lifetime. If this happens the electron is transferred from the donor to the acceptor on a picosecond-timescale with an efficiency approaching unity. This way free charge carriers are created and N-INNER final scientific report – Project: Evaluation platform for polymeric solar cells Morphoso V subsequently both charge carriers have to be transported to their respective contact, i.e. the holes in the donor phase and the electrons in the acceptor phase. In an organic solar cell the morphology of the photoactive layer is crucial for the performance of the device: if the two phases are very finely intermixed all excitons will reach an interface of donor and acceptor within their lifetime and the creation of free charge carriers is very efficient. On the other hand, the high interface area means that a charge carrier is always located very near to the other phase during its path toward the electrode. This leads to high(er) recombination which reduces especially the fill factor and thus the power output. On the other hand a coarse morphology will certainly improve the transport properties and thus reduce the recombination rate but will at the same time reduce the generation of free charge carriers because a certain fraction of the excitons will not be able to reach the donor/acceptor interface before they recombine. Of course the situation is far more complex and the morphology depends on layer thickness and process parameters like annealing, concentration and solvent. The aim of our efforts was to achieve a deeper understanding of the correlation between the morphological characteristics of the photoactive layer and its electro-optical properties which finally determine the device performance of an organic solar cell or module to a large extent. Our approach was to establish an evaluation platform that integrates device-modelling, -processing and characterisation to find the theoretical and experimental correlation between the thin film process, its nanomorphology and the generation and transport of charge carriers in the finished devices. In the beginning an inter-laboratory round robin study was performed and it confirmed that the measurements of the three project partners are well comparable."
113,,2009.0,EMISSION LOAD OF HEXABROMOCYCLODODECANE IN JAPAN BASED ON THE SUBSTANCE FLOW ANALYSIS,"Atmospheric and aquatic emission load of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) for the period 1986-2030 were estimated by substance flow analysis. Through the investigation of quantitative HBCD life cycle, estimated HBCD stock in the use phase shows a continuous increase, indicating that emissions from the materials containing HBCD will be potentially long-term sources of pollutants leaching or volatizing to the environment. In Japan, 571 kg/year and 41 kg/year of HBCD was calculated to emit to the atmospheric and aquatic environment in 2000, respectively. This corresponds to 0.03 % of the consumed HBCD quantity in Japan. These environmental emissions of HBCD were increasing rapidly until 2011. On the other hand, decreasing trend for HBCD were estimated between 2012 and 2030 and the emissions were simulated to be as high as 225 kg/year in 2030. This is due to the scenario that the use of HBCD for textiles would be stopped. The largest component of the emissions is simulated to be into the atmosphere from the consumer product because the stock in the use phase has been growing over the whole period. The source profile of environmental emission would shift from upstream to downstream of product chain. The present study gives an insight to obtain basic information for long term measures toward strategic chemical management considering their life cycle Introduction Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) are important synthetic additives which are used to reduce the flammability of articles. Despite their benefits, however, the occurrence of BFRs in the environment as contaminants have recently an increasing attention because of the widespread use, high chemical stability and bioaccumulation potential of some BFRs. Among the BFRs, which are available commercially, HBCD has received more interest and has been conducted the risk assessment. Currently, increasing number of reports have shown the environmental distribution of HBCD in Europe , the U.S.A and Asia 4, . In current risk assessments, however, especially for the calculation of predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) in the environmental exposure assessment, the available dataset in Japan is usually limited. For reliable risk management, the need for identification of its sources and quantification of emissions are growing in importance. HBCD has been detected in various environmental compartments such as house dust, riverine sediment near the HBCD production plant and sewage sludge from municipal sewage treamtment plant . This implies that emissions of HBCD occur from private use and disposal of flame retarded products, as well as upon production and processing. Identification of emissions covering with the lifecycle (i.e., from production to disporsal) could be of concern for risk assessments. Thus, it is essential to gain knowledge about their behavior in both economic system and environmental system through the lifecycle for chemical substances. Currently, limited research work has focused on the intensive monitoring which is covered with the lifecycle of chemical substance. For the effective risk-reduction strategies of chemical pollutants, the methodology, which can estimate emissions and source of pollutants through their lifecycle, has been needed. Recently, substance flow analysis (SFA), which is used to describe or analyse the flow of one substance in, out and through a system, have been proposed as a useful tool to evaluate fate of substances quantitatively during all life stages. This includes the evaluation of sources, substance flows and pathways, stocks in private house-holds, industry and waste management. Traditionally, several researchers have employed SFA to support environmental management of heavy metals 9 from the view point of material recycling and resource recovery. On the other hand, only few studies to date have been performed for chemical substances. Recenty, Morf et alevaluated the source and environmental emission of some BFRs (Deca BDE and HBCD) through their lifecylce in Switzerland. However, environmental emission and lifecycle of target chemicals vary among countries or areas depending on the application of products and technologies. Vol. 71, 2009 / Organohalogen Compounds page 002471 In this study, we conducted dynamic (the time series) SFA of HBCD, which is one of the most important BFRs on the market in Japan under several scenarios to obtain basic information for long term measures toward strategic chemical management. The aim of this study was to identify possible emission pathways and determine the environmental occurrence of HBCD in Japan. Materials and Methods To estimate environmental emissions of HBCD from past to future during all life stages, the time series substance flow analysis (SFA), which consider the residence times of product, was applied in this study. For the procedure to establish the substance flow of HBCD, we determined the life cycle of HBCD with regard to space, function and time at first. As a next step, the environmental emission, the amount of flow and stock were quantified. The parameter functions for substance flow analysis were estimated based on broad literature data, multiple contacts with research groups, organizations, authorities and industry in Japan, our own analysis and assumptions. The life cycle of HBCD and Data. The system flow of HBCD in Japan is shown in Fig. 1.The spatial system boundary was defined as the border of Japan. The import of product containing HBCD (e.g., plastic and textile/furniture) and the export of waste have not been included in this study, due to the limitation of available data. Also, we have not considered about the flow after recycling process. In the industrial use stage, the use of HBCD was divided into polystyrene as insulation board and textile. During industrial use of polystyrene, some portion of insulation board was transferred to the use phase and the remaining was recycling. In order to take into account the difference of life time of consumer products during the private use process, the use of insulation board was divided into four applications as end-product (i.e., office building, reinforced concrete house, wooden residential house and tatami mat). On the other hand, the use of textile was divided into interior textile and automobile interior textile. During life time of these consumer products, we have not considered about the degradation loss of HBCD. Finally, the consumer product is distributed after its residence time in the use phase to the waste (landfill or incineration) or recycling processes. In Japan, the product containing HBCD has been disposed to stable type landfill. Therefore, we assume the products are stabilized after one year and release no HBCD. Also, we have considered about the waste containing HBCD, which is generated at each life cycle step (i.e., pre-consumer waste). In this system, the time span was set up 1986-2030 and the time unit was one year. Based on the life cycle of HBCD, the quantitative data concerning to emissions, flow and stock were gathered as a next step. In each stage, the amount of environmental emission and transfer were calculated by multiplying the input to each sage and emission factor and/or transfer coefficient. The input to a stage corresponds to the amount of transfer from the previous stage. The initial input of HBCD to the system corresponds to the amount of domestic demand, whereas the import HB CD is directly added to the industrial use stage. Emission factors during all the life stages were evaluated or estimated according to EU Risk assessment report of HBCD. To confirm the reliability of factors and whether emission factors from EU can be applied into those of Japan, we have interviewed to the relevant company and committee. Emission factor are defined as constant value from past to future (i.e., 1986-2030), although environmental emission depend heavily on new production and waste management techniques. Transfer coefficients were also defined as constant value. The data were gathered from available literature. These values, in particular management strategies, could be time-dependent. However, due to the limitation of available data, they were defined as constant value through the time period in this study. For the consumption (sum of the amount of domestic demand and import) and application patterns (four application of insulation board and two for textile) of HBCD, the estimated consumption data of HBCD are available from 1986 to 2001in Japan. Based on this data from 1986 to 2001, we extrapolated the consumption to 2030. For this prediction of HBCD consumption, the textile industry association demonstrates that the use of HBCD will be banned until 2013, whereas the use of HBCD for polystyrene as insulation board will be increased. Therefore, this study was incorporated in that scenario. For application patterns, based on the available literature data on relevant industry from 1986 to 2006, we extrapolated the application patterns to 2030. Among application pattern in HBCD, polystyrene as insulation board make up by far the most important component of HBCD consumption (80% in the present year). The application areas, textiles/furniture (20% each) is less important.

Stunted stature, osteoporosis and fractures in adult life are some of the adverse effects. While the impact of intrauterine alcohol on the brain has been extensively investigated, studies on the effects on bone are relatively few. Therefore, our study aimed to examine the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on bone microarchitecture in 3-week-old rats using Micro-focus X-Ray Computed Tomography (Micro CT). Time mated pregnant Sprague Dawley dams (13) were randomly placed into 3 groups: ethanol (n=5), saline control (n=5) and untreated control (n=3). The former 2 groups received treatment with 0.015ml/g of 25.2 % ethanol and 0.9 % sa line, respectively, for the first 19 days of gestation. The untreated group received no treatment. The pups remained with their dams until termination at 21 days of age. From each dam, 2 pups were collected resulting in: ethanol (n=10), saline controls (n= 10) and u ntreated controls (n = 6). The humeri of the pups were dissected and scanned using a 3DμCT scanner (Nikon XTH 225L) at 15 μm resolution. Trabecular and cortical parameters were analysed using Volume Graphics Studio® software following reconstruction. Results showe d a decrease in trabecular size, spaces, thickness, and volume. There was a decrease in cortical bone area in the ethanol group com pared to the controls. These findings may suggest that osteoporosis and fractures seen as gestational alcohol effects may be due to comp romised trabecular structure."

In Russia, cervical cancer screening with cytological techniques faces a problem of quality control. Currently, it is necessary to standardize the methodology for comparing the results of morphological methods. The aim of the paper was to compare the findings of cytological and histological studies when diagnosing cervical pathology, classify discrepancies, and evaluate the effectiveness of the cytological method. Materials and methods. A comparative retrospective analysis of cytological examination followed by histological examination was carried out in 2,739 patients. Results. Both methods showed coincidence in 57.9% of cases. Minor and major discrepancies were determined in 29% and 13.1% of cases, respectively. The cytologic technique showed the following figures: sensitivity of 79.3%, specificity of 77.6%, positive prognostic value of 80%, and negative predictive value of 76.9%. When using the liquid-based cytology method, the number of true positive results was significantly higher, while that of false negative results was lower. The interval of up to 2 months between cytological and histological examinations yielded the highest rate of true positive and the lowest rate of false negative results. Conclusion. Comparing the results of morphological methods is most likely to be the best option for ensuring quality control of laboratory tests. This should be a guideline with a subsequent revision of samples in the presence of discrepancies, analysis of their causes, and evaluation of method effectiveness."

Additionally, bound charge transfer (CT) states that result from the exchange of charge carriers across the donor/acceptor interface are believed to play an important role in charge generation. Though organic thin films are often disordered, enhancements to the local structural order at the donor/acceptor interface have recently been shown to greatly influence CT state energetics and the charge generation process. In this progress report, recent efforts to understand the role that donor/acceptor morphology plays in the behavior of CT states and the resulting implications on OPV function are presented. It is aimed to provide a survey of different experimental approaches and to present a balanced examination of current interpretations of key results, and to offer best practices for the fabrication and study of morphologically tunable donor/acceptor CT states."

These two-dimensional printing techniques are differentiating factors from coated OPVs enabling the direct patterning of arbitrarily shaped and sized features into visual shapes and, increasing the freedom to connect the cells in modules. The inverted OPV structures comprise five layers that are either printed or patterned in an R2R printing process. We examined the rheological properties of the inks used and their relationship with the printability, the compatibility between the processed inks, and the morphology of the R2R-printed layers. We also evaluate the dimensional accuracy of the printed pattern, which is an important consideration in designing arbitrarily-shaped OPV structures. The photoactive layer and top electrode exhibited excellent cross-dimensional accuracy corresponding to the designed width. The transparent electron transport layer extended 300 µm beyond the designed values, whereas the hole transport layer shrank 100 µm. We also examined the repeatability of the R2R fabrication process when the active area of the module varied from 32.2 cm(2) to 96.5 cm(2). A thorough layer-by-layer optimization of the R2R printing processes resulted in realization of R2R-printed 96.5 cm(2) sized modules with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.1% (mean 1.8%) processed with high functionality."
121,10.3390/ma11122560,2018.0,Recent Developments in the Optimization of the Bulk Heterojunction Morphology of Polymer: Fullerene Solar Cells,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, made with semiconducting polymers, have recently attained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 14% in single junction cells and over 17% in tandem cells. These high performances, together with the suitability of the technology to inexpensive large-scale manufacture, over lightweight and flexible plastic substrates using roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, place the technology amongst the most promising for future harvesting of solar energy. Although OPVs using non-fullerene acceptors have recently outperformed their fullerene-based counterparts, the research in the development of new fullerenes and in the improvement of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology and device efficiency of polymer:fullerene solar cells remains very active. In this review article, the most relevant research works performed over the last 3 years, that is, since the year 2016 onwards, in the field of fullerene-based polymer solar cells based on the copolymers PTB7, PTB7-Th (also known as PBDTTT-EFT) and PffBT4T-2OD, are presented and discussed. This review is primarily focused on studies that involve the improvement of the BHJ morphology, efficiency and stability of small active area devices (typically < 15 mm2), through the use of different processing strategies such as the use of different fullerene acceptors, different processing solvents and additives and different thermal treatments."

The state of the art still focuses on the mechanical feasibility of such designs with limited discussions on the tracking performance of the vehicle during configuration switching. In this letter, we first present a common framework to analyse the attitude errors of a folding quadrotor via the theory of switched systems. We then employ this framework to investigate the attitude tracking performance for two case scenarios - one with a conventional geometric controller for precisely known system dynamics; and second, with our proposed morphology-aware adaptive controller that accounts for any modeling uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, we cater to the desired switching requirements from our stability analysis by exploiting the trajectory planner to obtain superior tracking performance while switching. Simulation results are presented that validate the proposed control and planning framework for a foldable quadrotor’s flight through a passageway."

In this study, by synthesizing a new series of ITIC‐based NFAs having alkyl or alkoxy groups, it is found that the bulk heterojunction morphology dependence on the thickness of the photoactive layer becomes more severe as the difference in the surface energy of the donor and acceptor increases. It is believed that this observation is the origin that yields the device performance dependence on the thickness of the photoactive layer. Through sensitive control of the surface energy of these ITIC‐based NFAs, it is demonstrated that thickness‐insensitive OPVs can be achieved even using a doctor blade technique under air without using any additives. It is believed that present approach provides an important insight into the design of photoactive materials and morphology control for the printable OPVs using NFAs."
124,,1994.0,"Successful control of poliomyelitis by a combined OPV/IPV polio vaccine program in the West Bank and Gaza, 1978-93.","In the 1970s the incidence of poliomyelitis in Gaza and the West Bank was high, even among children immunized with as many as four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). This was thought to be due to interference in uptake from other enteroviruses in the environment. A combined program of OPV and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was instituted in these areas in 1978, and the incidence of polio declined dramatically. Wild poliovirus findings in sewage in 1990-91 coupled with two outbreaks of polio, one in Israel in 1988 and another in Jordan in 1992, were reminders that the area should still be considered endemic. The potential of fresh entry of wild poliovirus may occur via persons who may have personal protection but may still shed the virus due to inadequate enteric immunity. In addition, the combined program protects against vaccine-associated poliomyelitis. A similar modified combined OPV/IPV program has been adopted in Israel. The combination of OPV and IPV provides an important alternative strategy in the worldwide effort to eradicate poliomyelitis."

Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary hospital. Participants: Twenty-seven patients with complete BCLP and 27 class I control patients, aged 10 to 14 years. Main Outcome Measure: The pharyngeal airway volume and craniofacial morphology were evaluated using cone-beam computed tomography. Measurements were compared between groups and any correlations were identified. Results: A significantly smaller total pharyngeal airway volume (TPV), oropharyngeal airway volume, and upper (UOPV) and lower (LOPV) oropharyngeal airway volume were found in patients with BCLP than in class I control patients, with no difference in the nasopharyngeal volume between groups. Furthermore, the craniofacial morphology measurements of N-Me, S-Go, Or-C, Ptm-C, Me-C, Co-Go, Go-Me, Ptm-Or, N-S-Ar, and Ar-Go-Me significantly differed between the BCLP and control groups (all P < .05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that Ptm-C and Me-C; Ptm-C, Or-C, and Me-C; and Me-C explained 20.3%, 38.9%, and 17.1% of the variations in TPV (P = .025), UOPV (P = .002), and LOPV (P = .018), respectively. Conclusions: Total pharyngeal airway volume, TPV, OPV, UOPV, and LOPV were significantly smaller in patients with BCLP than in class I controls. In patients with BCLP, the maxilla showed inhibited sagittal development and a retrograde position; moreover, the pharyngeal airway volume was weakly associated with the position of the maxilla and mandible relative to the coronal plane."
126,10.1109/ACC.2013.6580770,2013.0,Iterative learning control of bead morphology in Laser Metal Deposition processes,"Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) is a layer-based manufacturing process in which a laser and powdered metal are used to create a molten bead that is then traced along a path to create functional parts. The properties of the structure, including shape and material microstructure, are the result of complex interactions between the laser, the powder, the part substrate and other factors. Thus, a control algorithm is needed to accurately produce the designed part. However, feedback control of the process can create phase lag in the resulting control structure, which in turn can create dimensional instability. Additionally, the LMD process has been shown to change with part height or layer number. Taking these issues into account, a feed-forward, adaptive-type controller that changes with each fabricated layer, should be used. This paper first presents a dynamic model for the LMD process that incorporates the dependency of the process on part height. Then, an optimal Iterative Learning Process Control algorithm is presented to regulate the melt pool morphology of a deposited part using layer number as the iteration axis. A simulation study on the LMD process using the designed process controller shows that it is able to achieve good tracking performance."
127,10.1109/MCS.2023.3253422,2023.0,Leveraging Morphological Computation for Controlling Soft Robots: Learning from Nature to Control Soft Robots,"Traditional robot designs typically employ rigid body parts and high-torque servo motors. This helps to obtain simple reproducible models and, therefore, to facilitate control. Soft robotics is a new research field that deliberately expands the design toolbox to a wide range of smart and, often, soft materials. This approach is generally inspired by the remarkable performance of biological systems, which use soft structures to interact successfully with noisy and hard-to-model environments and, as a result, outperform state-of-the-art robots in open-world scenarios. However, using soft bodies comes with a significant disadvantage. Soft materials often have complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes them hard to model and therefore difficult to control. To fulfill the potential of soft robotics to achieve performances close to biological systems, this control problem has to be solved. A promising solution is another bioinspired principle called morphological computation, which proposes to outsource functionality directly to the body morphology. From this point of view, the seemingly undesired nonlinear dynamics become a resource for implementing nonlinear functionalities. This extends the control design problem to the question of how to design the body morphology of the robot. While there exist proofs of concept that demonstrate the potential of this approach, the existing work (for the most part) is lacking mathematical rigor and a general framework. We believe that the control community has the right set of tools to support the development of a design framework for morphological computation. The goal of this article (see “Summary”) is to provide an introduction to the concepts of soft robotics and morphological computation, explain how they can work together, and (with the help of examples) illustrate their potential for control. The hope is to inspire members of the control community to develop novel control frameworks for the next generation of soft robots."

However, the route to optimal photoactive film morphology toward high-performance indoor devices has remained obscure. The leakage current dominated by morphology exerts distinguishing influence on the performance under different illuminations. We have demonstrated that morphology reoptimization plays an important role in indoor OPVs, and their optimal structural features are different from what we laid out for outdoor devices. For indoor OPVs, in order to facilitate low leakage current, it is essential to enhance the crystallinity, phase separation, and domain purity, as well as keeping small surface roughness of the active layer. Furthermore, considering the reduced bimolecular recombination at low light intensity, we have shown that PM6:M36-based indoor devices can work effectively with a large ratio of the donor and acceptor. Our work correlating structure-performance relation and the route to optimal morphology outlines the control over device leakage current and recombination losses boosting the progress of efficient indoor OPVs."
129,10.1002/admi.201801763,2019.0,Impact of Initial Bulk‐Heterojunction Morphology on Operational Stability of Polymer:Fullerene Photovoltaic Cells,"Controlling initial bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of photoactive layer is critical for device efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. However, its impact on performance, specifically long‐term operational stability is still poorly understood. This is mainly due to limitations in direct measurements enabling in situ monitoring of devices at a molecular level. Here, a thermal annealing preconditioning step is utilized to tune initial morphology of model polymer:fullerene BHJ OPV devices and molecular resonant vibrational spectroscopy to identify in situ degradation pathways. Direct spectroscopic evidence is reported for molecular‐scale phase‐segregation temperature (TPS) which critically determines a boundary in high efficiency and long operational stability. Under operation, initially well‐mixed blend morphology (no annealing) shows interface instability related to the hole‐extracting layer via de‐doping. Likewise, initially phase‐segregated morphology at a molecular level (annealed above TPS) shows instability in the photoactive layer via continuous phase‐segregation between polymer and fullerenes in macroscales, coupled with further fullerene photodegradation. The results confirm that a thermal annealing preconditioning step is essential to stabilize the BHJ morphology; in particular annealing below TPS is critical for improved operational stability while maintaining high efficiency."

Bats are known for their pronounced, fast wing articulations, e.g., bats can mobilize as many as forty joints during a single wingbeat, with some joints reaching to over one thousand degrees per second in angular speed. Copying bats flight is a significant ordeal, however, very rewarding. Aerial drones with morphing bodies similar to bats can be safer, agile and energy efficient owing to their articulated and soft wings. Current design paradigms have failed to copy bat flight because they assume only closed-loop feedback roles and ignore computational roles carried out by morphology. To respond to the urgency, a design framework called Morphing via Integrated Mechanical Intelligence and Control (MIMIC) is proposed. In this paper, using the dynamic model of Northeastern University's Aerobat, which is designed to test the effectiveness of the MIMIC framework, it will be shown that computational structures and closed-loop feedback can be successfully used to mimic bats stable flight apparatus."
131,10.1080/08927022.2017.1296958,2017.0,Computationally connecting organic photovoltaic performance to atomistic arrangements and bulk morphology,"Rationally designing roll-to-roll printed organic photovoltaics (OPVs) requires a fundamental understanding of active layer morphologies optimised for charge separation and transport, and which ingredients can be used to self-assemble those morphologies. In this review article we discuss advances in three areas of computational modelling that provide insight into active layer morphology and the charge transport properties that result. We explain the computational bottlenecks prohibiting atomistically-detailed simulations of device-scale active layers and the coarse-graining and hardware acceleration strategies for overcoming them. We review coarse-grained simulations of OPV active layers and show that high throughput simulations of experimentally-relevant length scales are now accessible. We describe a new Python package diffractometer that permits grazing-incidence X-ray scattering patterns of simulated active layers to be compared against experiments. We explain the accurate calculation of charge-carrier mobilities from coarse-grained active layer morphologies by using atomistic backmapping, quantum chemical calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We employ these simulations to show that ordering of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) explains a factor of 1000 improvement in charge mobility. In concert, we present a suite of computational tools enabling large-scale electronic properties of organic photovoltaics to be studied and screened for by molecular simulations."
132,10.1002/jmor.20846,2018.0,Allometric scaling of morphology and engulfment capacity in rorqual whales,"Body length is one of the most important factors that influence organismal function and ecological niche. Although larger animals tend to have a suite of physiological advantages, such as lower mass‐specific metabolic rates and lower costs of transport, they may also experience significant limitations to unsteady locomotor performance or maneuverability because of the relative scaling of control surface areas and body mass. Rorqual whales are the largest of all animals and thus represent a unique study system for understanding how animals function at the extreme of body mass. Rorquals are characterized by an engulfment‐filtration foraging strategy facilitated by a complex set of morphological adaptations. We studied the scaling of key morphological structures related to locomotion and feeding in six rorqual species in a comparative framework. Our analyses show that most rorqual species exhibit positive allometry of both the control surfaces and body length, but the large scaling differences between these parameters suggest that larger rorquals will predictably suffer from decreased maneuverability and unsteady locomotor performance. However, we found that the dimensions of the engulfment apparatus also exhibit positive allometry, and thus engulfment capacity was relatively greater in larger rorquals. We posit that the allometric growth in the engulfment apparatus may be an adaptation that ameliorates the detrimental effects of large size on maneuverability. Our analyses also reveal significant differences in the scaling of mass‐specific engulfment capacity among rorqual species that may reflect the evolution of unique foraging behaviors and the exploitation of divergent ecological niches."

The aim of the study was to observe the morphofunctional changes in the par otid gland after the administration of MSG in rats. 18 newborn male Sprague Dawley rats were used, divided into three groups (Control group; MSG 1 group: 4 mg/g weight of monosodium glutamate, 5 doses, kept for 8 weeks, and MSG2 group: 4 mg/g weight of MSG, 5 doses, kept fo r 16 weeks). The body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and the salivary flow, pH, a-amylase activity, Na, Cl, K and Ca were analyzed by quantitative analysis. After euthanasia by ketamine/xylazine overdose, parotid volume was analyzed and stereology was performed . MSG administration caused an increase in BMI and a decrease in parotid volume as well as a reduction in salivary flow and pH and an incre se in a-amylase activity, also increasing the salivary sodium and chlorine levels. Alterations in the normal stereological parameters of the gland were observed. Exposure to MSG caused morphofunctional alterations at parotid gland."

Unfortunately, there are no post‐deposition treatments available to rationally improve the morphology and performance of as‐cast LBG:fullerene OPV active layers, where thermal annealing usually fails. Therefore, there is a glaring need to develop post‐deposition methods to guide the morphology of LBG:fullerene bulk heterojunctions towards targeted structures and performance. In this paper, the structural evolution of PCPDTBT:PCBM mixtures with solvent annealing (SA) is examined, focusing on the effect of solvent quality of the fullerene and polymer in the annealing vapor on morphological evolution and device performance. The results indicate that exposure of this active layer to the solvent vapor controls the ordering of PCPDTBT and PCBM phase separation very effectively, presumably by inducing component mobility as the solvent plasticizes the mixture. These results also unexpectedly indicate that solvent annealing in a selective solvent provides a method to invert the morphology of the LBG:fullerene mixture from a polymer aggregate dispersed in a polymer:fullerene matrix to fullerene aggregates dispersed in a polymer:fullerene matrix. The judicious choice of solvent vapor, therefore, provides a unique method to exquisitely control and optimize the morphology of LBG conjugated polymer/fullerene mixtures."
135,10.1021/acsami.7b00781,2017.0,Importance of Solvent Removal Rate on the Morphology and Device Performance of Organic Photovoltaics with Solvent Annealing.,"Solvent vapor annealing has been widely used in organic photovoltaics (OPV) to tune the morphology of bulk heterojunction active layer for the improvement of device performance. Unfortunately, the effect of solvent removal rate (SRR) after solvent annealing, which is one of the key factors that impact resultant morphology, on the morphology and device performance of OPV has never been reported. In this work, the nanoscale morphology of small molecule (SM):fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell from different SRRs after solvent annealing was examined by small-angle neutron scattering and grazing incidence X-ray scattering. The results clearly demonstrate that the nanoscale morphology of SM:fullerene BHJ especially fullerene phase separation and concentration of fullerene in noncrystalline SM was significantly impacted by the SRR. The enhanced fullerene phase separation was found with a decrease of SRR, while the crystallinity and molecular packing of SM remained unchanged. Correlation to device performance shows that the balance between pure fullerene phase and mixing phase of SM and fullerene is crucial for the optimization of morphology and enhancement of device performance. Moreover, the specific interfacial area between pure fullerene phase and mixing phase is crucial for the electron transport and thus device performance. More importantly, this finding would provide a more careful and precise control of morphology of SM:fullerene BHJ and offers a guideline for further improvement of device performance with solvent annealing."

Melatonin received at ZT11 or with drinking water resulted in an increased area of the browning zone in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT), even in rats with HCD (compared with Control or HCD, respectively). The b eige adipocyte and lipid droplet area after melatonin use were reduced compared to those with HCD and Control, in all administration modes (group ZT01 showed smaller changes compared to ZT11 or with drinking water groups). The fibrosis level decreased and significan tly differed in HCD ZT01, HCD ZT11, and HCD water compared to that in HCD; moreover, the lowest value determined in HCD water, reached the control parameters. Furthermore, the IL-1b and IL-8 level was decreased in the HCD groups under melatonin treatment at ZT11 or with drinking water compared to that in HCD. The obtained results suggest that melatonin promotes sWAT browning in rats with diet-induced obesity and influences morphological signs of normal rats depending on the time of administration. Different funct ional activity of beige adipocytes was observed after melatonin was used depending on the time of administration, resulting in heat p roduction and lipolysis (the relative mass of visceral fat was likewise diminished). More rapid browning was observed when melatonin trea tment was performed at 1 h before lights-off (ZT11) or continuously via drinking water. Melatonin acted on beige adipocytes of obese rats through changing some parameters such as the area of adipocytes and lipid drops, the number of lipid drops, the relative area b rowning of sWAT, and the level of tissue fibrosis."

However, the functional morphology of this anal horn and the genitalia have not been studied to date. Herein, we investigated the functional morphology of the genitalia and the nongenital structures of the scorpionfly Cerapanorpa dubia by observing the mating process and dissecting the freeze‐fixated pairs in copula to reveal the copulatory mechanism. The male C. dubia provides a solid salivary mass to the female as a nuptial gift prior to copulation. When the female starts to feed on the gift, the male uses his notal organ and complex genital structures to control the closest wing and genitalia of the female to establish a V‐shaped mating position. In the maintenance phase of copulation, the male uses his anal horn in cooperation with the basally‐constricted abdominal segment VII to clamp female abdominal segment VIII. The male hypovalves grasp female cerci, and move up and down rhythmically. The paired parameres clasp both sides of female tergite IX. The basal processes on male gonostyli grip the pleural membranes of the female genital chamber. In the sperm transfer phase, the male aedeagus directly couples with the female medigynium to transmit sperm by connecting his phallotreme to the female's copulatory pore. The evolution of the male complex grasping structures in Panorpidae is also briefly discussed."
138,10.23919/ACC53348.2022.9867794,2021.0,"Internal Feedback in Biological Control: Diversity, Delays, and Standard Theory","Neural architectures in organisms support efficient and robust control that is beyond the capability of engineered architectures. Unraveling the function of such architectures is challenging; their components are highly diverse and heterogeneous in their morphology, physiology, and biochemistry, and often obey severe speed-accuracy tradeoffs; they also contain many cryptic internal feedback pathways (IFPs). We claim that IFPs are crucial architectural features that strategically combine highly diverse components to give rise to optimal performance. We demonstrate this in a case study, and additionally describe how sensing and actuation delays in standard control (state feedback, full control, output feedback) give rise to independent and separable sources of IFPs. Our case study is an LQR problem with two types of sensors, one fast but sparse and one dense but slow. Controllers using only one type of sensor perform poorly, often failing even to stabilize; controllers using both types of sensors perform extremely well, demonstrating a strong diversity-enabled sweet spot (DESS). We demonstrate that IFPs are key in enabling this DESS, and additionally that with IFPs removed, controllers with delayed sensing perform poorly. The existence of strong DESS and IFP in this simple example suggest that these are fundamental architectural features in any complex system with diverse components, such as organisms and cyberphysical systems."

This software consists of a central System Automation module, which handles operating modes and activates the applicable flight control loops. The cascaded control loops can either be activated by the command from the flight operator or fully automatically based on sensor and GPS-integrity information or data link availability. This paper presents the extension of the System Automation module, by an automatic loiter functionality.

A mechanistic understanding of this process has broad implications to ecology and medicine. However, many control factors and their impacts on colony formation remain underexplored. Here we propose a reaction-diffusion based dynamic model to quantitatively describe cell division and colony expansion, where control factors of colony spreading take the form of nonlinear density-dependent function and the intercellular impacts take the form of density-dependent hill function. We validate the model using experimental E. coli colony growth data and our results show that the model is capable of predicting the whole colony expansion process in both time and space under different conditions. Furthermore, the nonlinear control factors can predict colony morphology at both center and edge of the colony."
141,10.1002/jmor.21362,2021.0,"The prostate of the bat Artibeus lituratus: Seasonal variations, abiotic regulation, and hormonal control","The prostate is an important gland that contributes to the male reproductive process, producing secretions that are essential for maintaining ideal conditions for the survival of sperm. Studies indicate a wide variation in the occurrence, morphology, and physiology of this gland in mammals, especially in bats, with this variation being related not only to the number of regions and their degree of compaction/lobulation but also to fluctuations in their functioning throughout the year. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the annual morphological and physiological variations of the male prostate of Artibeus lituratus and analyze their responses to annual abiotic variations and hormonal control. Sixty sexually adult males of A. lituratus were analyzed in this study, with five specimens collected monthly. Blood samples were submitted to serum hormone measurements and the prostates were morphologically, morphometrically, and immunohistochemically analyzed. The results indicated that the two prostatic regions (ventral and dorsal) of A. lituratus had different morphology, as well as different physiology and regulation. Annual fluctuations in abiotic factors seemed to influence the dorsal region more than the ventral region. Conversely, variations on testicular factors, such as testosterone and estradiol, influenced the ventral region more than the dorsal region. Despite these differences, both prostatic regions were strongly synchronized to the main reproductive peak of the species in September. The holocrine pattern of the ventral prostate was not directly affected by abiotic factors or by factors released by the testes."

RAD51, a DNA-repairing protein, involves homologous recombination and has a vital role in genome stability. Polymorphism of the RAD51 gene, and its overexpression, has been proposed to be associated with the development of breast cancer. Overexpression of RAD51 in many types of human cancer including metastatic breast cancer may signify its potential use as a biomarker. Considering the numerous reports on the role of the 5'-UTR-RAD51 polymorphism in breast cancer, this study aimed to investigate the utility of RAD51 gene expression and its variants G135C and G172T as a possible foretelling factor of breast cancer development. DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry of RAD51 were conducted on 103 samples from patients diagnosed with sporadic breast cancer and 80 samples from a control group. The results demonstrated that the RAD51 variants, G135C and G172T, were significantly presented in the breast cancer tissue compared with the control group. RAD51 expression was mainly shown in the cytoplasm of malignant cells (56% of cases) and significantly correlated with p53 and G135C, C135C variants. Moreover, the occurrence of the G172T variant was significantly associated with the expression of estrogen receptor. Interestingly, 21/26 (81%) of the triple-negative breast cancer showed G135C and C135C genotypes that were significantly associated with the expression of RAD51 (73%). In conclusion, the G135C and C135C variants together with the cytoplasmic expression of RAD51 may have clinical potential as a prognostic predictor for breast cancer development and aggressiveness."
143,10.1103/PHYSREVAPPLIED.6.054008,2016.0,Drift-Diffusion Studies of Compositional Morphology in Bulk Heterojunctions: The Role of the Mixed Phase in Photovoltaic Performance,"The active layers of most organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are constructed from a blend of two organic compounds. The two materials spontaneously segregate into pure-component phases during device fabrication, creating a bicontinuous network of conduction pathways that are selective for electron or hole charge carriers. The morphological distribution of these materials within the active layer has long been known to influence charge transport and resulting device performance. In addition to the two purecomponent phases present in these devices, a third, mixed-composition phase exists at the interface between the two pure phases. The exact effects of this mixed-composition phase on OPV device performance are not well understood, although it is argued that the presence of a mixed phase is necessary for optimal device operation. In this paper, we probe the effects of having a mixed-composition interfacial phase on the performance and charge-transport characteristics of OPV devices through a series of driftdiffusion model simulations. We start with set of model morphologies with only pure-component phases and then introduce an interfacial mixed phase in a controllable fashion. Our simulations show that a modest amount of mixing initially improves device efficiency by reducing the tortuosity of the device’s conduction pathways and easing morphological traps. However, an excessive amount of mixing can actually degrade high-conductivity pathways, reducing photovoltaic performance. The point at which mixing switches from being beneficial to detrimental to OPV performance depends on the average domain size of a device’s morphology. Devices with smaller feature sizes are more susceptible to the debilitating effects of overmixing, so that the presence of a mixed phase may either raise power-conversion efficiency by as much as 100% or lower it by as much as 50%, depending on the average domain size and the extent of mixing. These trends suggest that variations in the amount of mixed-composition phase with different processing conditions is one of the key factors that makes optimizing bulk heterojunction OPV devices difficult."
144,10.1002/adma.201800453,2018.0,Recent Advances in Morphology Optimization for Organic Photovoltaics,"Organic photovoltaics are an important part of a next‐generation energy‐harvesting technology that uses a practically infinite pollutant‐free energy source. They have the advantages of light weight, solution processability, cheap materials, low production cost, and deformability. However, to date, the moderate photovoltaic efficiencies and poor stabilities of organic photovoltaics impede their use as replacements for inorganic photovoltaics. Recent developments in bulk‐heterojunction organic photovoltaics mean that they have almost reached the lower efficiency limit for feasible commercialization. In this review article, the recent understanding of the ideal bulk‐heterojunction morphology of the photoactive layer for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport is described, and recent attempts as well as early‐stage trials to realize this ideal morphology are discussed systematically from a morphological viewpoint.

145,10.1109/ICECE.2018.8636721,2018.0,"Effect of pH Variation on Structural, Optical and Shape Morphology of BiVO4Photocatalysts","Visible light driven photocatalysts have gathered enormous interest in recent years because of their capability to harvest energy directly from sunlight by water splitting and also to purify water. Bismuth Vanadate (BVO) is one of the most potential photocatalysts for water pollutant degradation and hydrogen production by oxidation of water. In our study, highly crystalline Bismuth Vanadate nanoparticles have been synthesized by a straightforward hydrothermal route where pH is varied to observe the change in morphology of the particles. Thermal analysis confirmed the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation temperature at 350 °C. A hierarchical development of monoclinic - tetragonal heterostructure of Bismuth Vanadate is further confirmed by Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns and the obtained particle size is 27nm. Band gap energy has been tailored through control of pH to explore the optical band gap for suitable photocatalytic properties. It is found that a heterostructure composed of rod and spherical shaped nanoparticles for a pH value 6.5, closer to neutral, demonstrating better optical properties for efficient photocatalytic activity with a band gap energy of 1.8 eV."
146,10.1039/C3TC31812E,2014.0,Solution structure: defining polymer film morphology and optoelectronic device performance,"Film structure plays a critical role in defining the performance of all organic optoelectronic devices, with the importance clearly illustrated in the development of organic acceptor–donor bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic (OPV) devices where solvent and/or thermal annealing of the deposited active layer affect solar cell output. Herein we report that the polymer–polymer interactions in solution, which are dependent on the thermal history of the solution, are a first order parameter in controlling the properties of the final active layer and hence device performance. We illustrate the key role played by organic semiconductor interactions in solution with the high efficiency donor–acceptor co-polymer, poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), and its blends with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Differences in the cooling rate of the casting solution after dissolution can lead to a 20% variation in the ultimate efficiency of cells with identical active layer thicknesses with slow-cooled solutions giving rise to poorer devices. The oft-ignored intermolecular (polymer–polymer) interactions that occur in solution are manifest by dramatic differences in viscosity and are a function of concentration and molecular weight. Hence solution thermal history represents a critical new dimension in the processing landscape for organic polymer semiconductors."
147,10.1039/C3TC31245C,2013.0,"Directly probing the molecular order of conjugated polymer in OPV blends induced by different film thicknesses, substrates and additives","In organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic (OPV) devices, formation of a phase-separated morphology of the blend thin film with a high degree of molecular order is required for efficient device performance. Using resonant Raman spectroscopy we monitor in situ the P3HT molecular order in P3HT:PCBM blend films influenced by the substrate, film thickness and additives. We report that molecular order depends on substrate for as-cast films, consistent with vertical phase separation driven by a surface energy gradient, but is standardised to a highly ordered state by thermal annealing. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals this phase transition to a more ordered state begins at 40–60 °C for ∼120 nm thick blend films, which corresponds to the glass transition temperature (Tg). Ultra-thin (<10 nm thick) blend films had greater P3HT order than the bulk and reorganised at lower temperatures, which we propose is due to a P3HT-rich interfacial layer at the film/air interface, and that extra disordered component retained despite annealing is due to P3HT trapped in a disordered state within the corresponding PCBM-rich substrate interface. Finally we probe how the 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) additive improves P3HT molecular order in blends by increasing phase separation during deposition, finding that 3% ODT by volume presents a saturation point for improving molecular order, and the improvement is comparable to that by thermal annealing. Through in situ experiments and varied fabrication conditions, we have built an understanding of how processing conditions determine conjugated polymer molecular order in blends, with the aim of controlling morphology for higher OPV efficiencies."

The objective of this study is to establish the correlation between performance in weekly quizzes with performance in global tests and the final exam of first ye ar Odontology students at the Universidad de los Andes. We measured 737 observations corresponding to the average of weekly morpho logy quizzes with the average of the semestral morphology global tests and the final exam, taken by 370 students admitted in first y ear of Odontology at the Universidad de los Andes between the years 2011 to 2014 included. The data was analyzed with Student’s T test and Pearson’s correlation. Continuous variables were described with measures of central tendency and dispersion. There is a signifi cant positive correlation (p value <0.001), between the average of the morphology weekly control grades and the averages of global t est grades of 0.736; between the average of the weekly control grades and the final exam grade of 0.577 and between the average of global test grades and the exam grades of 0.763. According to our observations, the results of the weekly control grades correlate pos itively with the results of the global tests and the final exam, so it could be considered as one of the measurable predictors of academic p erformance."

In addition to control; wet P3HT:PC60BM thin films were exposed to E-field of Van de Graaff (VDG) generator at three different directions-horizontal (H), tilted (T), and vertical (V)-relative to the plane of the substrate. Surface and bulk characterizations of the field-treated BHJs affirmed that fullerene molecules can easily penetrate the spaghetti-like P3HT and move up and down following the E-field. Using E-field treatment, we achieved favorable morphologies with efficient charge separation, transport, and collection. We improve; (1) the hole mobility values up to 19.4 × 10-4 ± 1.6 × 10-4 cm2 V-1 s-1 and (2) the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of conventional and inverted OPVs up to 2.58 ± 0.02% and 4.1 ± 0.40%, respectively. This E-field approach can serve as a new morphology-tuning technique, which is generally applicable to other polymer-fullerene systems."

Active layer films are analyzed by AFM, nanomechanical mapping, UV–vis spectroscopy, and XRD. Devices prepared with isopropanol solvent vapor annealing (SVA) combined with thermal annealing (TA) show the highest environmental resistance and performance. Such devices yield average PCE of 3.3%, with stability to atmospheric exposure of up to 60 min prior to encapsulation. Encapsulated devices exposed to the laboratory environment for 30 days exhibit a decrease in PCE of ∼15%. On application of a second TA step PCE is recovered to over 90% of the original value. The unprecedented air stability of the cells is attributed to the formation of an active layer with a stable, favorable morphology during the SVA process, which is associated with lower oxygen content films. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

151,10.1039/C6NR05361K,2016.0,"Counterbalancing of morphology and conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate based flexible devices.","The importance of conductive polymer electrodes with a balance between the morphology and electrical conductivity for flexible organic photovoltaic properties has been demonstrated. Highly transparent PEDOT:PSS anodes with controlled conductivity and surface properties were realized by insertion of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a fluorosurfactant (Zonyl) as efficient additives and used for flexible organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) which are based on a bulk-heterojunction of polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). We investigated the correlation between the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS electrodes and their influences on the surface morphology of the active materials (PTB7:PC71BM). When the device was prepared from the PEDOT:PSS layer functioning as an anode of OPV through an optimized ratio of 5 vol% of DMSO and 0.1 wt% of fluorosurfactant, the devices exhibited improved fill factor (FF) due to the enhanced coverage of PEDOT:PSS films. These results correlate with reduced photoluminescence and increased charge extraction as seen through Raman spectroscopy and electrical analysis, respectively. The conductive polymer electrode with the balance between the morphology and electrical conductivity can be a useful replacement for brittle electrodes such as those made of indium tin oxide (ITO) as they are more resistant to cracking and bending conditions, which will contribute to the long-term operation of flexible devices."
152,10.1039/C5EE02912K,2016.0,Morphological and electrical control of fullerene dimerization determines organic photovoltaic stability,"Fullerene dimerization has been linked to short circuit current (Jsc) losses in organic solar cells comprised of certain polymer–fullerene systems. We investigate several polymer–fullerene systems, which present Jsc loss to varying degrees, in order to determine under which conditions dimerization occurs. By reintroducing dimers into fresh devices, we confirm that the photo-induced dimers are indeed the origin of the Jsc loss. We find that both film morphology and electrical bias affect the photodimerization process and thus the associated loss of Jsc. In plain fullerene films, a higher degree of crystallinity can inhibit the dimerization reaction, as observed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements. In blend films, the amount of dimerization depends on the degree of mixing between polymer and fullerene. For highly mixed systems with very amorphous polymers, no dimerization is observed. In solar cells with pure polymer and fullerene domains, we tune the fullerene morphology from amorphous to crystalline by thermal annealing. Similar to neat fullerene films, we observe improved light stability for devices with crystalline fullerene domains. Changing the operating conditions of the investigated solar cells from Voc to Jsc also significantly reduces the amount of dimerization-related Jsc loss; HPLC analysis of the active layer shows that more dimers are formed if the cell is held at Voc instead of Jsc. The effect of bias on dimerization, as well as a clear correlation between PL quenching and reduced dimerization upon addition of small amounts of an amorphous polymer into PC60BM films, suggests a reaction mechanism via excitons."
153,10.1002/jmor.20685,2017.0,Functional morphology of the female reproductive system of a crab with highly extensible seminal receptacles and extreme sperm storage capacity,"We studied the functional morphology of the female reproductive system of the purple stone crab Danielethus crenulatus. The most remarkable feature is the relative storage capacity and extensibility of the seminal receptacles. These receptacles are a pair of simple sacs that lack internal structures dividing the internal lumen. Differences in seminal receptacle size and contents are accompanied by conspicuous changes in receptacle lining at a tissue level. Full seminal receptacles contain discrete sperm masses formed by hardened fluid and densely packed spermatophores. Different sperm masses are likely from different mates and their stratified disposition within the seminal receptacles is compatible with rival sperm displacement and last sperm precedence. Additionally, the anatomical structure of the vulva and vagina suggest active female control over copula. We discuss our results in the general context of sperm storage in brachyurans and the implications for the mating system of this species."
154,10.1021/acsami.0c20389,2020.0,Effect of Side-Chain Modification on the Active Layer Morphology and Photovoltaic Performance of Liquid Crystalline Molecular Materials.,"Controlling the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer by fine-tuning the molecular structure of semiconducting organic materials is one of the most effective ways to improve the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. In this contribution, we investigate the photovoltaic performance of benzodithiophene (BDT)-based p-type small molecules with three different side chains, namely alkyl-thio (BTR-TE), dialkylthienyl (BTR), and trialkylsilyl (BTR-TIPS) moieties substituted on the BDT core, when used alongside a nonfullerene acceptor. The side-chain changes on the BDT core are shown to have a profound effect on energy levels, charge generation, recombination, morphology, and photovoltaic performance of solid-state molecules. Compared with BTR and BTR-TIPS, BTR-TE-based single-junction binary blend solar cells show the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% due to improved morphology and charge transport with suppressed recombination. In addition, we also achieved relatively good performances for ternary blend solar cells with a PCE of 16.1% using BTR-TE as a third component. Our results show that side-chain modification has a significant effect on modulating active layer morphology, and in particular that thioether side-chain modification is an effective way to achieve optimum morphology and performance for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices."
155,10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00331,2019.0,Interfacial and Bulk Nanostructures Control Loss of Charges in Organic Solar Cells.,"Organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as one promising sustainable energy resource since the introduction of state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device structure in early 1990s. Impressively developed molecular design methodologies in the past decade have led researchers toward utilizing more suitable pairs of low (p-type) and high (n-type) electron affinity organic semiconducting materials. Among other attributes, versatile absorption capabilities of these materials highlight their favorable utilization in a single layer BHJ structure. Interaction of these verstile organic materials may lead to explicit interfaces, phase distributions, and crystalline nanostructures. Structural characterization techniques involving soft and hard X-rays have enabled us to measure these morphology parameters quantitatively including their string correlation with photovoltaic (PV) parameters. Favorable processing techniques have been adopted to realize auspicious interfacial areas and charge percolations in bulk toward efficient short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) values. Collaborative efforts in the fields of chemical structure design of materials, device characterization, and engineering have pushed the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to 16%. However, the single layer BHJ structure still requires further optimizations for the extension of their PCEs toward the theoretical limit. Maximum utilization of solar energy by organic blend films is the key to match their potential with inorganic/perovskite solar cells. Having comparable JSC and FF values in organic versus inorganic photovoltaic devices, open circuit voltage (VOC) is the only PV parameter limiting the development of OSCs in comparison to their inorganic competitors. This is due to unfavorable competition between rates of charge generation and recombination. Loss of charges during these generation and recombination processes account for the energy loss of the device, ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 V in state-of-the-art OSCs. Highly efficient (14-16%) single layer BHJ devices usually suffer from high energy loss with VOC limited to 0.9 V. Comparatively, devices with reported VOC > 0.9 V suffer from poor JSC and FF values due to unfavorable interfacial ordering and bulk crystalline nanostructures. First part of the Account will address the charge losses during their transfer (interfacial losses) and influential role of interfacial nanostructures in controlling them toward efficient JSC and VOC values. Later, we will discuss losses during exciton diffusion and free charge transport (bulk losses) toward limited charge extraction. We will debate about the role of donor/acceptor nanostructures in correlation with influential photophysics studies to control these losses in small molecule (SM) acceptor based devices. We search for exaggerated crystalline phases of SM acceptor in competition with polymer donor to realize balanced and more efficient charge percolations. These improved diffusion and transport bulk nanostructures will suppress nonradiative (NR) pathways and bulk charge losses toward simultaneous enhancement of FF and VOC values. Favorable interfacial and bulk morphology will drive efficient diffusion, transfer, transport, and extraction of charges in organic blend films. This Account will guide chemists and engineers to optimize chemical structure design and blend film nanostructures toward suppressed energy loss of OSCs."
156,10.1117/1.JPE.6.045501,2016.0,Morphology-defined interaction of copper phthalocyanine with O2/H2O,"Abstract. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is an important hole transport layer for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), but interaction with ambient gas/vapor may lead to changes in its electronic properties and limit OPV device lifetimes. CuPc films of thickness 25 and 100 nm were grown by thermal sublimation at 25°C, 150°C, and 250°C in order to vary morphology. We measured electrical resistance and film mass in situ during exposure to controlled pulses of O2 and H2O vapor. CuPc films deposited at 250°C showed a factor of 5 higher uptake of O2 as detected by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), possibly due to the formation of β-CuPc at T>200°C which allows higher O2 mobility between stacked molecules. While weight-based measurements stabilize after ∼10  min of gas exposure, resistance response stabilizes over times >1  h, suggesting that mass change occurs by rapid adsorption at active surface sites whereas resistive response is dominated by slow diffusion of adsorbates into the bulk film. The 25 nm films exhibit higher resistive response than 100 nm films after an hour of O2/H2O exposure due to fast analyte diffusion down to the film/electrode interface. We found evidence of decoupling of CuPc from the gold-coated QCM crystal due to preferential adsorption of O2/H2O molecules on gold."
157,10.1039/C6CP04019E,2016.0,Thermal effect on the morphology and performance of organic photovoltaics.,"The morphology of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is a significant factor in improving performance, and establishing a method for controlling morphology is necessary. In this study, we propose a device-size simulation model, combining reptation and the dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm, to investigate the relationship between the manufacturing process, morphology, and OPV performance. The reptation reproduces morphologies under thermal annealing, and DMC showed morphology-dependence of performance: not only short-circuit current density but also open-circuit voltage had optimal interfacial areas due to competition between exciton dissociation and charge collection. Besides, we performed transient absorption spectroscopy of various BHJ morphologies under realistic conditions, which revealed prompt and delayed dynamics of charge generation-the majority of the charges were from excitons that were generated on interfaces and dissociated within a few picoseconds, and the others from excitons that migrated to interfaces and dissociated on the order of sub-nanoseconds."
158,,2015.0,The prevalence of the red cell morphology changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Previous studies have shown that hematological alterations are a common finding in patients with diabetes. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of the red cell morphology changes in diabetic patients and their correlation with markers of glycemic control. Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited for this study. Patient demographics, relevant concomitant illnesses and medical history were recorded. Anthropometric, biochemical parameters (fasting plasma glucose - FPG, glycated hemoglobin - HbA1c, glomerular filtration rate - GFR) and morphology of blood smear were assessed. Results were compared with the same measurements in 30 subjects without diabetes mellitus. The groups were similar in terms of age and gender but there were statistically significant differences for the recorded parameters in patients of study group and control subjects. Regarding the assessment of FPG, in the study group were recorded averages of 217.70±73.20 mg÷dL compared with controls that compared with controls that had a blood glucose value of 90.03±6.59 mg÷dL. In the study group, mean HbA1c was 7.95±1.99%. For the control group, the mean value of HbA1c was 5.65±0.32%. In the study group, GFR ranged between 47.70 and 118.90 mL÷min.÷1.73 m². For the control group, GFR values were between 88.00 and 130.00 mL÷min.÷1.73 m². In the analysis of blood cytology for the study group, there were changes in the smear type hypochromia, anisocytosis and poikilocyosis (20 patients - 66.66%). In terms of red cell morphology, changes were recorded anulocytes type, red cells in ""mark to the target fired"" (codocytes), bream (leptocytes), schizocytes, and red cells in ""drop"" (dacryocytes). We observed a high prevalence of the red cell morphology changes in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic subjects. Our findings suggest the need of screening for routine hematological tests in type 2 diabetes mellitus."
159,10.1002/jmor.21248,2020.0,Functional morphology of the sperm‐containing chambers of the sea slug Okenia polycerelloides in the context of sexual selection,"Sea slugs are interesting models to study post‐copulatory sexual selection in simultaneous hermaphrodites due to the enormous variation of their reproductive systems. However, the knowledge of the functional morphology of their reproductive system is limited to few species, and it is rarely discussed in the context of sexual selection theory. In this study, we investigated the functional morphology of the sperm‐containing chambers (i.e., ampulla, seminal receptacle, and bursa copulatrix) of the reproductive system of Okenia polycerelloides (Ortea & Bouchet, 1983), based on light, confocal, and electron microscopy. Although the morphology of the ampulla is similar to other species, indicating that it is a site for autosperm storage, we found some sperm facing the ampullar epithelium, a feature commonly regarded as characteristic of the seminal receptacle of sea slugs. The seminal receptacle of O. polycerelloides showed secretory activity and contained sperm with distribution and orientation suggestive of stratification of allosperm from distinct mating events, a feature that would affect sperm competition. The bursa copulatrix had epithelial cells with secretory and absorptive characteristics, and contained degraded sperm and yolk granules within its lumen. Comparative analyses of the contents of each organ demonstrated that sperm digestion occurs in the bursa copulatrix and affects sperm heads first, changing their morphology from slender and curved to shorter and ellipsoid before complete lysis. Although digestion and absorption of surplus sperm are currently the main hypothesized functions for the bursa copulatrix, its role in cryptic female choice should not be ruled out. The close structural connection between the seminal receptacle and bursa copulatrix, as well as their muscular walls, would enable control over the fate of the sperm received in each mating event, that is, storage or digestion."
160,10.1002/aenm.202302029,2023.0,Unraveling High Reproducibility and Broad Composition Tolerance in High‐Efficiency Organic Solar Cells via Sequential Deposition,"The reproducibility issue is impeding the progress of commercialization in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, as the difficulty in precise micro‐nano structure control in bulk heterojunction films, as well as the ineluctable fluctuations of molecular weight and polydispersity index in the synthetic process. Due to such intrinsic properties, the poor regioregularity significantly affects the batch‐to‐batch variation in performance of large‐area or integrative scattered OPV devices. Seeking alternatives as compensatory strategies is expected to reduce the inevitable problem of reproducibility in the fabrication process. Herein, the application potential of a pseudo‐bilayer structure in high‐performance OPVs, by using the solution‐processed method is thoroughly examined, and it is observed that the sequentially‐deposited solar cells enjoy improve device reproducibility in addition to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement. Importantly, such desirable reproducibility in layer‐by‐layer structures raised from the film formation process provides new opportunities in ternary OPV devices, and an improved PCE of 18.70% can be achieved in a PM6/L8‐BO:PY‐IT device, where the counterpart ternary cases exhibit a decreasing trend in performance with the increasing content of PY‐IT. This work illustrates the spatial effects of pseudo‐bilayer OPV devices in the aspect of charge carrier transport/transfer, morphology and film formation kinetics, and provides a novel perspective to overcome the barriers to commercialization."

The study consisted of 55 rats of the “Wistar” breed, 100 days of age, over a period of 8 weeks. The animals were randomly distributed between four groups: control (CTLE); neuromuscular anaerobic (TAN); aerobic (TAE) and concurrent training (TCc). After four weeks, some of the animals were euthanized. The body mass index (BMI), Lee index (Lee), epididymal adipose tissue (TecAdp), body weight, and feed efficiency ratio (CoefAlim) were measured. The Anaerobic Threshold wa s determined by critical workload (7 %, 9 % and 11 % of body weight). TAE and TCc training caused alterations in Lee and BMI, at four and eight weeks respectively (LeeTAE=X:2.86 ±0.08; X:2.89±0.07 and LeeTCc=X:2.85 ±0.05; X:3.00±0.09). For the TecAdp, all groups presented a decrease, with the TCc value down after eight weeks (X:1.77 ±0.32).

Adult male mice (n=20, weight average: 45 g) were randomly divided into four groups including: group receiving saline (controls), low-dose (LD) 2.5 mg/kg TiO TiO 2 NPs, medium-dose (MD) 5 mg/kg TiO 2 NPs and high-dose (HD) 10 mg/kg TiO 2 NPs, daily using gavage for 35 days. To estimate the volume of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and sub-layers of dentate gyrus the Cavalieri principle was used. The physical dissector was used to determine the numerical density of dentate gyrus granular cells. For analyzing the morphology of dentate gyrus granular cells the qualitative Golgi staining was used. Our data showed that the total volume of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus and its sublayers including molecular, granular and polymorph in TiO 2 treated mice decreased significantly compared to the control group. Moreover, the total number and numerical density of dentate gyrus granular sub layer cells showed a significant reduction in all three experimental groups compared to the control group. The granular cells of the dentate gyrus had shorter dendritic length and decreased dendritic branches in the TiO 2 -treated in comparison with the control mice. These data can justify the disorders related to memory, learning and hippocampus neurons damages due to using of TiO 2 NPs."

Instead of the conventional poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS HTL, an alternative transition metal oxide HTL (molybdenum oxide (MoO(3))) is investigated to address the issue of surface immiscibility between graphene and PEDOT:PSS. Graphene films considered here are synthesized via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) using a copper catalyst and experimental issues concerning the transfer of synthesized graphene onto the substrates of OPV are discussed. The morphology of the graphene electrode and HTL wettability on the graphene surface are shown to play important roles in the successful integration of graphene films into the OPV devices. The effect of various cathodes on the device performance is also studied. These factors (i.e., suitable HTL, graphene surface morphology and residues, and the choice of well-matching counter electrodes) will provide better understanding in utilizing graphene films as transparent conducting electrodes in future solar cell applications."
164,10.1002/14651858.CD011260.PUB2,2014.0,Sequential inactivated (IPV) and live oral (OPV) poliovirus vaccines for preventing poliomyelitis.,"BACKGROUND
Poliomyelitis mainly affects unvaccinated children under five years of age, causing irreversible paralysis or even death. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live attenuated virus, which can, in rare cases, cause a paralysis known as vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP), and also vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) due to acquired neurovirulence after prolonged duration of replication. The incidence of poliomyelitis caused by wild polio virus (WPV) has declined dramatically since the introduction of OPV and later the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), however, the cases of paralysis linked to the OPV are currently more frequent than those related to the WPV. Therefore, in 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended at least one IPV dose preceding routine immunisation with OPV to reduce VAPPs and VDPVs until polio could be eradicated.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of sequential IPV-OPV immunisation schemes compared to either OPV or IPV alone.


SEARCH METHODS
In May 2019 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 14 other databases, three trials registers and reports of adverse effects on four web sites. We also searched the references of identified studies, relevant reviews and contacted authors to identify additional references.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, controlled before-after studies, nationwide uncontrolled before-after studies (UBAs), interrupted time series (ITS) and controlled ITS comparing sequential IPV-OPV schedules (one or more IPV doses followed by one or more OPV doses) with IPV alone, OPV alone or non-sequential IPV-OPV combinations.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 21 studies: 16 RCTs involving 6407 healthy infants (age range 96 to 975 days, mean 382 days), one ITS with 28,330 infants and four nationwide studies (two ITS, two UBA). Ten RCTs were conducted in high-income countries; five in the USA, two in the UK, and one each in Chile, Israel, and Oman. The remaining six RCTs were conducted in middle-income countries; China, Bangladesh, Guatemala, India, and Thailand. We rated all included RCTs at low or unclear risk of bias for randomisation domains, most at high or unclear risk of attrition bias, and half at high or unclear risk for conflict of interests. Almost all RCTs were at low risk for the remaining domains. ITSs and UBAs were mainly considered at low risk of bias for most domains. IPV-OPV versus OPV It is uncertain if an IPV followed by OPV schedule is better than OPV alone at reducing the number of WPV cases (very low-certainty evidence); however, it may reduce VAPP cases by 54% to 100% (three nationwide studies; low-certainty evidence). There is little or no difference in vaccination coverage between IPV-OPV and OPV-only schedules (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.06; 1 ITS study; low-certainty evidence). Similarly, there is little or no difference between the two schedule types for the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.70; 4 studies, 1948 participants; low-certainty evidence); or the number of people with protective humoral response P1 (moderate-certainty evidence), P2 (for the most studied schedule; two IPV doses followed by OPV; low-certainty evidence), and P3 (low-certainty evidence). Two IPV doses followed by bivalent OPV (IIbO) may reduce P2 neutralising antibodies compared to trivalent OPV (moderate-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to P1 or P2 neutralising antibodies following an IIO schedule or OPV alone (low-certainty evidence). Both IIO and IIbO schedules may increase P3 neutralising antibodies compared to OPV (moderate-certainty evidence). It may also lead to lower mucosal immunity given increased faecal excretion of P1 (low-certainty evidence), P2 and P3 (moderate-certainty evidence) after OPV challenge. IPV-OPV versus IPV It is uncertain if IPV-OPV is more effective than IPV alone at reducing the number of WPV cases (very low-certainty evidence). There were no data regarding VAPP cases. There is no clear evidence of a difference between IPV-OPV and OPV schedules for the number of people with protective humoral response (low- and moderate-certainty evidence). IPV-OPV schedules may increase mean titres of P1 neutralising antibodies compared to OPV alone (low- and moderate-certainty evidence), but the effect on P2 and P3 titres is not clear (very low- and moderate-certainty evidence). IPV-OPV probably reduces the number of people with P3 poliovirus faecal excretion after OPV challenge with IIO and IIOO sequences (moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce the number with P2 (low-certainty evidence), but not with P1 (very low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the schedules in number of SAEs (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.43; 2 studies, 1063 participants, low-certainty evidence). The number of persons with P2 protective humoral immunity and P2 neutralising antibodies are probably lower with most sequential schemes without P2 components (i.e. bOPV) than with trivalent OPV or IVP alone (moderate-certainty evidence). IPV (3)-OPV versus IPV (2)-OPV One study (137 participants) showed no clear evidence of a difference between three IPV doses followed by OPV and two IPV doses followed by OPV, on the number of people with P1 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03), P2 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03), or P3 (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05) protective humoral and intestinal immunity; all moderate-certainty evidence. This study did not report on any other outcomes.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
IPV-OPV compared to OPV may reduce VAPPs without affecting vaccination coverage, safety or humoral response, except P2 with sequential schemes without P2 components, but increase poliovirus faecal excretion after OPV challenge for some polio serotypes. Compared to IPV-only schedules, IPV-OPV may have little or no difference on SAEs, probably has little or no effect on persons with protective humoral response, may increase neutralising antibodies, and probably reduces faecal excretion after OPV challenge of certain polio serotypes. Using three IPV doses as part of a IPV-OPV schedule does not appear to be better than two IPV doses for protective humoral response. Sequential schedules during the transition from OPV to IPV-only immunisation schedules seems a reasonable option aligned with current WHO recommendations. Findings could help decision-makers to optimise polio vaccination policies, reducing inequities between countries."

Here, a solution to resolve the above challenge via synergistically combining the layer‐by‐layer (LbL) procedure and the ternary strategy is proposed and demonstrated. By adding an asymmetric electron acceptor, BTP‐S2, with lower miscibility to the binary donor:acceptor host of PM6:BO‐4Cl, vertical phase distribution can be formed with donor‐enrichment at the anode and acceptor‐enrichment at the cathode in OPV devices during the LbL processing. In contrast, LbL‐type binary OPVs based on PM6:BO‐4Cl still show bulk‐heterojunction like morphology. The formation of the vertical phase distribution can not only reduce charge recombination but also promote charge collection, thus enhancing the photocurrent and fill factor in LbL‐type ternary OPVs. Consequently, LbL‐type ternary OPVs exhibit the best efficiency of 18.16% (certified: 17.8%), which is among the highest values reported to date for OPVs. The work provides a facile and effective approach for achieving high‐efficiency OPVs with expected morphologies, and demonstrates the LbL‐type ternary strategy as being a promising procedure in fabricating OPV devices from the present laboratory study to future industrial production."

Devices with varied composition and morphology were measured over a range of illumination intensities ranging from dark conditions to 1 sun and applied bias voltages ranging from 0.0 V to 0.75 V. Using an equivalent circuit model, materials properties such as dielectric constant and conductivity were determined and found to be in agreement with values measured by other methods. Average carrier lifetimes were also extracted from the model and found to correlate with measured power conversion efficiencies. At the short circuit condition and ∼1 sun illumination, the average electron lifetime was found to vary from 7.8 to 22 μs for devices with power conversion efficiencies ranging from 2.0 to 2.5%. These results suggest that impedance spectroscopy is an effective tool for predicting how processing parameters can impact device performance in organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices."
167,10.1002/jmor.21227,2020.0,"Morphology and immunohistochemistry of the olfactory organ in the bloodfin tetra, Aphyocharax anisitsi (Ostariophysi: Characidae)","Among teleost fishes, differences exist in the shape, number, and arrangement of the olfactory lamellae, the distribution of the sensory and non‐sensory epithelium, as well as, the abundance of various receptor cells. The objective of this work was to describe the morphology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy ultrastructure of the olfactory epithelium of the bloodfin tetra, Aphyocharax anisitsi. This is the first complete description including the anatomy, histology, and immunohistochemistry of the peripheral olfactory organ from a Characiformes. Based on the external morphology of the olfactory organ, A. anisitsi was classified as a ditermous species, with an olfactory cavity containing two openings divided by a skin flap that separates the anterior and posterior nostril. This species belongs to the group of isosmates, since the presence of accessory olfactory sacs was not observed, and non‐sensory ciliated cells were identified. A. anisitsi has an olfactory rosette with an arrow‐shaped arrangement, with differences in length between the anterior and posterior lamellae. In the olfactory epithelium, three types of olfactory receptor neurons were identified using histology and confirmed by immunohistochemistry, that is, ciliated olfactory receptor neurons in the basal region of the epithelium, microvillar olfactory receptor neurons in the middle region; and Crypt cells, in smaller numbers compared to the other neuronal types, present in the apical region. Sensory and non‐sensory areas were scattered and mixed along the lamellar lateral surface but the nasal cavity and the midline raphe lacked olfactory receptor neurons. The presence of abundant kinocilia in the non‐sensory cells could be related in A. anisitsi with ventilation and quality control of water entering the olfactory cavity. The spatial organization of the sensory and non‐sensory areas in A. anisitsi was similar to that observed in other species that also inhabit still and slow‐flowing bodies of water with high‐density vegetation."
168,,2015.0,Evaluation of the implantation site morphology in spontaneous abortion.,"The aim of this study was the characterization of the implantation site through histological and immunohistochemical exams and the evaluation of the changes that appear in the pregnancies ended by spontaneous abortion compared to normal pregnancies ended by requested abortion. One hundred eight patients were divided in two groups: the study group that included 58 patients with spontaneous abortion and the control group that included 50 patients with requested abortion. There has been made uterine curettage in all the cases after a complete preoperative evaluation and the obtained product was sent for histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical study using a VEGF antibody. Studying the histological sections, we noticed the vasculogenesis stages chronology and then according to the histological aspects of normal pregnancy we noticed the histological changes that occurred at the site of implantation in the cases with pathological pregnancies ended by miscarriage. Our results from this study seem to indicate a correlation between decidual vascular changes and the appearance of miscarriage. In pregnancies ended by miscarriage, we found delays in the trophoblast development according to the gestational age at which the event abortifacient happened. The study emphases the temporal differentiation of utero-placental angiogenesis comparing to villous vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the first trimester miscarriage and normal pregnancy. At the control group, VEGF expression was positive in 88% of cases, while in the study group, pregnancies ended by spontaneous abortion, positive expression of VEGF was present in only 31% of cases. Our data suggest vascular disorders and are in concordance with other histological and ultrasound studies postulating the idea of a link between miscarriage and placental vascular bed pattern changes."
169,10.1039/d0se00704h,2020.0,Control of the molecular orientation in small molecule-based organic photovoltaics,"The continuously improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics in the past few years is largely ascribed to the synthesis of new molecular donors and acceptors as well as the subsequent optimization of morphology of the active layers. As one crucial morphological parameter, the interfacial molecular orientation of organic semiconductors not only determines the charge separation and transport, but also influences the device energy loss process. The control of the molecular orientation of photoactive materials via tuning process conditions, especially for molecular semiconductors, is becoming vitally important and is full of challenges. Here, we systematically summarize previous work on molecular orientation control in small molecule (SM)-based thin films and discuss the dependency of molecular orientation on three critical aspects, including substrate properties, processing methods, and solution systems. More importantly, the impact of the molecular packing configuration on the device performance in terms of generation of photocurrent and photovoltage in SM-based devices is comprehensively analyzed. Finally, we propose future potential directions for further promoting research on molecular orientation control in SM-based OPVs."

In this article, we discuss the design objectives and related physical scaling laws, focusing on energy consumption, agility and speed, and survivability and robustness. We divide the control of such vehicles into low-level stabilization and higher-level planning such as motion planning, and we argue that a highly relevant problem is the integration of sensing with control and planning. Lastly, we describe some vehicle morphologies and the trade-offs that they represent. We specifically compare multicopters with winged designs and consider the effects of multivehicle teams. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems, Volume 5 is May 2022.

171,10.1021/nn200744q,2011.0,A new model for the morphology of P3HT/PCBM organic photovoltaics from small-angle neutron scattering: rivers and streams.,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted increasing interest as a lightweight, low-cost, and easy to process replacement for inorganic solar cells. Moreover, the morphology of the OPV active layer is crucial to its performance, where a bicontinuous, interconnected, phase-separated morphology of pure electron donor and acceptor phases is currently believed to be optimal. In this work, we use neutron scattering to investigate the morphology of a model OPV conjugated polymer bulk heterojunction, poly[3-hexylthiophene] (P3HT), and surface-functionalized fullerene 1-(3-methyloxycarbonyl) propyl(1-phenyl [6,6]) C(61) (PCBM). These results show that P3HT and PCBM form a homogeneous structure containing crystalline P3HT and an amorphous P3HT/PCBM matrix, up to ca. 20 vol % PCBM. At 50 vol % PCBM, the samples exhibit a complex structure containing at least P3HT crystals, PCBM crystals, and a homogeneous mixture of the two. The 20 vol % PCBM samples exhibit behavior consistent with the onset of phase separation after 6 h of thermal annealing at 150 °C, but appear to be miscible at shorter annealing times. This suggests that the miscibility limit of PCBM in P3HT is near 20%. Moreover, for the 50 vol % PCBM sample, the interface roughens under thermal annealing possibly owing to the growth of PCBM crystals. These observations suggest a different morphology than is commonly presented in the literature for optimal bulk heterojunctions. We propose a novel ""rivers and streams"" morphology to describe this system, which is consistent with these scattering results and previously reported photovoltaic functionality of P3HT/PCBM bulk heterojunctions."
172,10.1002/adfm.202206707,2022.0,Managing Challenges in Organic Photovoltaics: Properties and Roles of Donor/Acceptor Interfaces,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have demonstrated increasing potential for use in large‐area, flexible, and light‐weight applications. To date, the rapid development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) and their conjugated polymeric donors have increased the efficiency of OPV by over 19%. Nevertheless, OPV is still suffering from high energy loss, which primarily derives from the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial charge recombination. In particular, the voltage loss occurring at the D/A interface accounts for the current bottleneck, hampering further enhancement of the OPV efficiency. In this review, the recent discovery of D/A interfacial photophysics in NFA‐based OPVs, including the comparison with its fullerene‐based counterpart, is covered. Additionally, the factors governing interfacial energy loss, such as interfacial energetics and local morphologies, which causes the trade‐off relationship between photovoltage and photocurrent in OPV are highlighted. Accordingly, the control of D/A interfacial properties to create an “ideal” interface for charge generation in OPVs is reviewed; and emphasized that the D/A interfacial modifications can serve as a powerful tool to manage the challenges in OPVs path toward future practical applications."
173,10.1002/jmor.21696,2024.0,Prolonged use of a soft diet during early growth and development alters feeding behavior and chewing kinematics in a young animal model,"In infants and children with feeding and swallowing issues, modifying solid foods to form a liquid or puree is used to ensure adequate growth and nutrition. However, the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of prolonged use of this intervention during critical periods of postnatal oral skill development have not been systematically examined, although substantial anecdotal evidence suggests that it negatively impacts downstream feeding motor and coordination skills, possibly due to immature sensorimotor development. Using an established animal model for infant and juvenile feeding physiology, we leverage X‐ray reconstruction of moving morphology to compare feeding behavior and kinematics between 12‐week‐old pigs reared on solid chow (control) and an age‐ and sex‐matched cohort raised on the same chow softened to a liquid. When feeding on two novel foods, almond and apple, maintenance on a soft diet decreases gape cycle duration, resulting in a higher chewing frequency. When feeding on almonds, pigs in this group spent less time ingesting foods compared to controls, and chewing cycles were characterized by less jaw rotation about a dorsoventral axis (yaw) necessary for food reduction. There was also a reduced tendency to alternate chewing side with every chew during almond chewing, a behavioral pattern typical of pigs. These more pronounced impacts on behavior and kinematics during feeding on almonds, a tougher and stiffer food than apples, suggest that food properties mediate the behavioral and physiological impacts of early texture modification and that the ability to adapt to different food properties may be underdeveloped. In contrast, the limited effects of food texture modification on apple chewing indicate that such intervention/treatment does not alter feeding behavior of less challenging foods. Observed differences cannot be attributed to morphology because texture modification over the treatment period had limited impact on craniodental growth. Short‐term impacts of soft‐texture modification during postweaning development on feeding dynamics should be considered as potential negative outcomes of this treatment strategy."
174,10.47162/RJME.65.1.09,2024.0,Effects of quercetin on gentamicin-induced experimental testicular injury in rats,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of gentamicin (GEN) on the testis and whether quercetin (QUE) has any protective effect. Twenty-four adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into equal four groups: control (0.9% saline solution), GEN (80 mg/kg GEN), QUE (50 mg/kg QUE) and GEN+QUE (80 mg/kg GEN + 50 mg/kg QUE). Histopathological (HP) evaluation of testis was performed, epididymal sperm parameters were analyzed and oxidative status was evaluated. The use of QUE improved the HP findings, such as decrease in the germinal epithelial thickness in the testicular tissue of the GEN group, decrease in the Johnsen’s tubular biopsy score (JTBS), increase in the rate of immature cell shedding tubules, and the apoptotic index (AI). In the GEN group, sperm count, and abnormal morphology increased compared to the control group; the viability and motility decreased according to the sperm analysis results. In the GEN+QUE group, QUE was found to improve sperm viability and morphology. In the GEN group, tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased while superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels decreased. Compared with the GEN+QUE group, it was found that the tissue MDA level decreased, while the levels of SOD, CAT and GPx increased. The results demonstrate that GEN impairs testicular structure and function, and QUE treatment can prevent this adverse effect."
175,10.1002/jmor.21098,2020.0,Evaluation of the uterine hormonal control of the bat Artibeus lituratus during the different phases of its reproductive cycle,"Artibeus lituratus is a frugivorous bat that directly assists in the restoration of degraded habitats through the effective dispersion of seeds and fruits. Given its great importance, this work aimed to evaluate the uterine hormonal control of A. lituratus during its different reproductive phases. The uteri of 30 sexually mature adult females, five specimens for each of the six sample groups (NON, nonreproductive; P1, initial pregnancy; P2, intermediate pregnancy; P3, advanced pregnancy; LAC, lactating; P + LAC, pregnant‐lactating), were submitted to analyses of serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations, in addition to immunohistochemical analyses. Both estradiol and progesterone, gradually increased during pregnancy, with a marked significant increase in P3 females. Both returned to low levels in LAC‐females; however, estradiol levels decreased further in P + LAC‐females, while progesterone increased in the same group. In general, signs indicative of aromatase expression were observed in the endometrium of all analyzed groups and in the placenta of bats in the gestation groups. Similarly, ERα and PR were expressed in the myometrium, endometrium and placenta at varying levels of intensity. The results indicate that the uterine microenvironment of A. lituratus is directly regulated by serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone, and fluctuations in these concentrations control morphological and physiological changes of this organ during different phases of the reproductive cycle."
176,,2016.0,Strategies for Controlling Bulk Heterojunction Morphology,"Organic photovoltaic devices have been extensively studied as a means to produce sustainable energy. However, the performance of organic-photovoltaic (OPV) devices is dependent upon a number of factors including the morphology of the active layer, device architecture, and processing conditions. Recent research has indicated that fullerenes in the bulk heterojunction are entropically driven to the silicon and air interfaces upon crystallization of P3HT, which occurs during thermal annealing. The first chapter of this research focuses on investigating the structure and function of endtethered poly(3-hexylthiophene) chains to a transparent electrode as an anode buffer layer. Neutron reflectivity reveals that these P3HT brush layers have severe effects on the vertical distribution of PCBM across the depth of the BHJ films, the extent of which depends on the grafting density of the P3HT brush layer. These results are confirmed by energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy measurements. Another emerging trend in the advancement of OPVs is through the addition of a third component to impose morphological or electronic benefits to BHJ-based devices. In Chapter 3 of this dissertation, three different low MW P3HTs are incorporated into BHJ films as additives to reveal fundamental aspects of their behavior as a function of size and loading level. The best performing loading levels for each additive are found to be inversely proportional to the MW of the P3HT additive and appear to be driven by a coarsening of BHJ film morphology. The incorporation of porphyrin-based additives into BHJ OPV devices has been an emerging trend in recent years due to their strong solar absorption and π − π"
177,10.1109/CDC.2001.981122,2001.0,Modeling and control of thin film morphology using unsteady processing parameters: Problem formulation and initial results,"Thin film deposition is an industrially-important process to which control theory has not historically been applied. The need for control is growing as the size of integrated circuits shrinks, requiring increasingly tighter tolerances in thin film manufacture. In this work we formulate a lattice model of film growth as a control system and take the process parameters as inputs. In the evolution equation, nonlinear functions of the process parameters multiply linear vector fields, yielding a structure similar to a bilinear system. The process conditions in some deposition methods are inherently unsteady, which produces films with altered morphology. We use the model developed in this study to analyze the effects of fast periodic forcing on thin film evolution. With the method of averaging we develop new effective transition rates which may produce film properties unattainable with constant inputs. These effective rates are the convex hull of the set of rates associated with constant inputs. We present conditions on the convex hull for which the finite-time and infinite-time reachability sets cannot be expanded with fast periodic forcing. An example in which this forcing increases the reachability set and produces more desirable morphology is also presented."

180,10.1021/am505283k,2014.0,Molecular weight dependence of the morphology in P3HT:PCBM solar cells.,"In polymer-based photovoltaic devices, optimizing and controlling the active layer morphology is important to enhancing the device efficiency. Using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with well-defined molecular weights (MWs), synthesized by the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) method, we show that the morphology of the photovoltaic active layer and the absorption and crystal structure of P3HT are dependent on the MW. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the crystallinity of P3HT reached a maximum for intermediate MWs. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction showed that the spacing of the (100) planes of P3HT increased with increasing MW, while the crystal size decreased. Nonlinear crystal lattice expansions were found for both the (100) and (020) lattice planes, with an unusual π-π-stacking enhancement observed between 50 and 100 °C. The melting point depression for P3HT, when mixed with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and, hence, the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter depended on the MW. PCBM was found to perturb the ordering of P3HT chains. In photovoltaic devices, P3HT with a MW of ∼20K showed the best device performance. The morphologies of these blends were studied by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering. In GISAXS, we observed that the low-molecular-weight P3HT more readily crystallizes, promoting a phase-separated morphology."
181,10.17816/morph.624714,2024.0,Characteristics of proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes after administration of ascorbic acid in a model of radiation hepatitis,"BACKGROUND: Radiation hepatitis with the development of radiation-induced acute liver failure is considered one of the most serious complications of radiotherapy for malignant neoplasms of the liver, abdominal organs, or whole body irradiation. However, the exact mechanisms of radiation-induced liver cell death have not been fully elucidated, and therefore the study of changes in the proliferative-apoptotic ratio in liver structures remains relevant, and pre-irradiation administration of ascorbic acid can potentially protect them from the effects of electron irradiation. 
AIM: assessment of proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes after administration of ascorbic acid in a model of radiation hepatitis. 
METHODS: Wistar rats (Rattus Wistar; n=40) were divided into four experimental groups: I – control (n=10); II (n=10) – fractional irradiation with electrons in a total irradiation dose of 30 Gy; III (n=10) – administration of ascorbic acid before electron irradiation; IV (n=10) – administration of ascorbic acid. Animals of all groups (I – IV) were removed from the experiment a week after the last fraction. Morphological and immunohistochemical (with antibodies to Ki-67 and caspase-3) studies were carried out. 
RESULTS: A week after electron irradiation, a sharp decrease in the proportion of Ki-67-positive hepatocytes in combination with an increase in immunolabeling with antibodies to caspase-3 was observed in group II. During the administration of ascorbic acid in group III, less pronounced depth and range of liver damage was noted, confirmed by morphological and immunohistochemical methods (less pronounced decrease in the level of Ki-67 expression and an increase in the proportion of caspase-positive hepatocytes compared to the control) methods. 
CONCLUSION: An immunohistochemical study of proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes revealed that a week after fractional electron irradiation in SOD 30 Gy, there is a decrease in mitotic activity and an increase in cell death, and pre-irradiation administration of ascorbic acid helped level out the detected changes, which indicates its protective effect."
182,10.1002/jmor.21583,2023.0,"Characterizing lift, drag, and pressure differences across wandering salamanders (Aneides vagrans) with computational fluid dynamics to investigate aerodynamics","Wandering salamanders (Aneides vagrans), known to occupy the crowns of old growth coast redwood trees, have recently been found to decelerate and engage in controlled, nonvertical descent while falling. Closely related, nonarboreal species with seemingly minor morphological differences exhibit far less behavioral control while falling; however, the influence of salamander morphology on aerodynamics remains to be tested. Here, we examine differences in morphology and aerodynamics of two salamander species, A. vagrans and the nonarboreal ensatina salamander (Ensatina eschscholtzii), using a combination of traditional and contemporary techniques. Specifically, we compare morphometrics statistically, then use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to characterize predicted airflow and pressure over digitally reconstructed models of the salamanders. While similar in body and tail lengths, A. vagrans are more dorsoventrally flattened with longer limbs and greater surface area of the foot relative to body size than the nonarboreal E. eschscholtzii. CFD results show dorsoventral pressure gradients differ between the two digitally reconstructed salamanders resulting in lift coefficients of approximately 0.02 and 0.00, and lift:drag ratios of approximately 0.40 and 0.00 for A. vagrans and E. eschscholtzii, respectively. We conclude that the morphology of A. vagrans is better suited for controlled descent than that of the closely related E. eschscholtzii and highlight the importance of subtle morphological features, such as dorsoventral flatness, foot size, and limb length, for aerial control. That our simulation reports align with real‐world performance data underscores the benefits of CFD for studying the link between morphology and aerodynamics in other taxa."

184,,2015.0,Study of Device Physics and Active Layer Morphology in Polymer-Fullerene Based Solar Cells: The Role of Vertical Phase Segregation and Organic/Metal Interface,"Author(s): Zhang, Guangye | Advisor(s): Schwartz, Benjamin J | Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are flexible, low cost and easily processable, which provides them with a very short energy payback time compared to most PV technologies and makes them strong candidates for industrial mass production. The richness of organic synthesis has afforded a large library of molecular semiconductors, among which the combination of conjugated polymers as electron donors and fullerenes as electron acceptors has been demonstrated to be the best sellers as building blocks of OPV devices. In the past few years, the majority of research focus on OPVs has been devoted to improving their power conversion efficiencies by using new combinations of polymer and fullerene materials. Most devices are based on blend-cast bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), in which a polymer and fullerene are mixed together in a solution that is then used to cast the active layer of the organic solar cell. Because the nm-scale morphology of the film depends on so many of the details of how it is cast, the device performance of blend-cast BHJ solar cells is hypersensitive to the processing kinetics of the active layer. Thus, for any new set of OPV materials, an Edisonian approach involving the fabrication of hundreds of blend-cast devices is needed to find the processing conditions that lead to the optimal morphology and best device performance. In this thesis, I will focus on two main contributions that I have made to help rationally design OPVs.First, our group recently has gone beyond the traditional method of simply blending the donor and acceptor material by developing a new technique to process the active layer of OPVs called sequential processing. This method takes advantage of a pair of quasi-orthogonal solvents to process the two components used in the active layer separately. By studying a series of crystalline polymers with controlled regioregularities and polydispersities, I have found that increasing polymer crystallinity produces the opposite behavior in BHJ solar cells fabricated by sequentially-processing and blend-casting. This suggests that the two processing techniques are complementary and provides guidance on selecting the appropriate processing technique for a given polymer. Second, I have studied the performance and device physics of a new series of controllably tuned fullerene derivatives applied in traditional blend-cast active layers. We obtained a series of carefully designed 1,4-dibenzyl fullerene bisadducts synthesized by our collaborators in Prof. Yves Rubin's group. The fullerenes have methoxy substituents selectively positioned on pendant phenyl rings, which allows us to examine the effect of the subtle molecular changes on both macroscopic solar cell performance and the underlying device physics. Through carrier recombination studies, I have learned that solar cell performance often depends on the material's surface energy and the vertical phase segregation caused by this surface energy in the active layer. The results will allow us to offer new directions on how to select the best device structure with a given new fullerene material. Finally, I have helped to make an interesting discovery during my study of the device physics of as-cast sequentially processed solar cells. I found that the specific type of vertical phase segregation in the as-cast devices gives rise to dark carriers, whose presence can be measured using the charge extraction by linear increasing voltage (CELIV) technique. The dark carriers directly clearly are created by the evaporation of metal electrodes because I found no such carriers when non-metal interfacial layers were inserted between the metal and the organic layer. Through capacitance analysis and transmission electron microscopy studies, we found this n-type doping is caused by metal penetration into the fullerene domain. These findings could have significant impact on determining device performance, explaining device physics and guiding future research directions."

186,10.1002/aenm.201600961,2016.0,"New Insights into the Correlation between Morphology, Excited State Dynamics, and Device Performance of Small Molecule Organic Solar Cells","Morphology plays a vital role on the performance of organic photovoltaics. However, our understanding of the morphology‐performance relationships for organic photovoltaics remains lacking. Specifically, it is still an open question why some bulk‐heterojunction blends exhibit electric field dependent J–V curves, while others do not. Through detailed fs‐μs transient absorption spectroscopy and morphology studies on the representative bulk‐heterojunction type small molecule (SM) donor system, a picture of different J–V behaviors from morphology aspects and excited dynamics is revealed. Our findings reveal that amorphous morphology in the lack of percolated pathways leads to the formation of strongly bound charge transfer states (CTSs), which accounts for about one third of the photoexcited species. Therefore, field‐dependent J–V curves are obtained as these CTSs mainly undergo geminate recombination or function as interfacial traps for nongeminate recombination. On the other hand, the CTSs are totally suppressed after post‐treatment owning to the formation of bicontinuous morphology, which results in very high efficiencies from exciton generation, diffusion, dissociation to charge extraction, thus contributes to field‐independent J–V characteristics. The insights gained in this work provide the effective guidelines to further optimize the performance of bulk‐heterojunction type SM‐organic photovoltaics through judicious morphology control and engineering."
187,10.1039/C4TA03469D,2014.0,Use of a commercially available nucleating agent to control the morphological development of solution-processed small molecule bulk heterojunction organic solar cells,"The nucleating agent DMDBS is used to modulate the crystallization of solution-processed small molecule donor molecules in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ OPV) devices. This control over donor molecule crystallization leads to a reduction in optimized thermal annealing times as well as smaller donor molecule crystallites, and therefore more efficient devices, when using an excessive amount of solvent additive. We therefore demonstrate the use of nucleating agents as a powerful and versatile processing strategy for solution-processed, small molecule BHJ OPVs."

Upon deliberate calcination, MIL-125(Ti) is converted to mesoporous hierarchical TiO2 (hier-TiO2) with an anatase phase, a large surface area and a variety of nanostructures. The morphology changes from 200 nm circular plates to 1 μm bipyramids with increasing PEGDGE amount, indicating the pivotal role of PEGDGE as a shape controller. When the hier-TiO2 is deposited onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) layer as the scattering layer, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with a quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte records a high conversion efficiency (7.1% at 100 mW cm−2), which is much higher than that of DSSCs with a nc-TiO2 layer only (4.6%) or with commercial scattering TiO2 (cs-TiO2) on a nc-TiO2 layer (5.0%). A solid-state DSSC using a single component solid polymer, i.e., poly((1-(4-ethenylphenyl)methyl)-3-butyl-imidazolium iodide) (PEBII), also exhibits an excellent efficiency of up to 8.0%. The improved efficiency results from the pivotal role of the hier-TiO2 in improving the surface area and light harvesting properties, as demonstrated by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, reflectance spectroscopy, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses."
189,10.1002/jmor.20279,2014.0,Functional morphology of the bovid astragalus in relation to habitat: Controlling phylogenetic signal in ecomorphology,"Bovid astragali are one of the most commonly preserved bones in the fossil record. Accordingly, astragali are an important target for studies seeking to predict the habitat preferences of fossil bovids based on bony anatomy. However, previous work has not tested functional hypotheses linking astragalar morphology with habitat while controlling for body size and phylogenetic signal. This article presents a functional framework relating the morphology of the bovid astragalus to habitat‐specific locomotor ecology and tests four hypotheses emanating from this framework. Highly cursorial bovids living in structurally open habitats are hypothesized to differ from their less cursorial closed‐habitat dwelling relatives in having (1) relatively short astragali to maintain rotational speed throughout the camming motion of the rotating astragalus, (2) a greater range of angular excursion at the hock, (3) relatively larger joint surface areas, and (4) a more pronounced “spline‐and‐groove” morphology promoting lateral joint stability. A diverse sample of 181 astragali from 50 extant species was scanned using a Next Engine laser scanner. Species were assigned to one of four habitat categories based on the published ecological literature. A series of 11 linear measurements and three joint surface areas were measured on each astragalus. A geometric mean body size proxy was used to size‐correct the measurement data. Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) was used to test for differences between habitat categories while controlling for body size differences and phylogenetic signal. Statistically significant PGLS results support Hypotheses 1 and 2 (which are not mutually exclusive) as well as Hypothesis 3. No support was found for Hypothesis 4. These findings confirm that the morphology of the bovid astragalus is related to habitat‐specific locomotor ecology, and that this relationship is statistically significant after controlling for body size and phylogeny. Thus, this study validates the use of this bone as an ecomorphological indicator. J. Morphol. 275:1201–1216, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Scientific and practical interest is caused by the use of collagenase enzyme for wound debridement. Aim: to study morphological changes in contaminated and purulent wounds when using “Iruksan” ointment containing collagenase. To reproduce a wound infection, the wound was contaminated with a pathogenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus in combination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microbiological, histological and statistical studies were conducted during the experiment. Control of contamination and identification of pathogens took place in all rats after contamination before use of ointment and at the day of exclusion from experiment. Due to microbiological findings, number of microorganisms in the wounds of animals of the control group remained practically unchanged (p>0.05) until the 10th day of observation, and in the experimental group (“Iruksan” ointment was used in the treatment of wounds), the number of microorganisms in the wounds has already decreased by the 7th day of the experiment (p<0.05). The obtained data correlate with the results of a morphological findings, especially with the severity of the inflammatory process. We noticed reduction of signs of the inflammatory process and the improvement of epithelization of the wound defect in the group of animals that were treated with “Iruksan” ointment containing collagenase. Due to the results of histological studies, complete coverage of the wound surface with newly formed epithelium was revealed on the 7th day of the experiment in the experimental group, in contrast to the control group where, on the 7th day, typical signs of the wound process for this time period were determined. In the control group of animals, epithelization of wounds was observed on the 10th day. The obtained data demonstrate expedience of use collagenase-based ointment for the treatment of wounds in the first phase of the wound process. It results in faster wound bed cleaning from necrotized tissues and enhance epithelialization."
191,10.18435/vamp29394,2023.0,The biomechanical significance of bifurcated cervical ribs in apatosaurine sauropods,"Bifurcated cervical ribs have evolved infrequently in dinosaurs. Previously documented examples include those in abelisaurid theropods, leptoceratopsid ceratopsians, and turiasaurian sauropods. In apatosaurine sauropods a spectrum of cervical rib morphologies exists, from cervical ribs with small dorsal processes extending from the shafts to completely bifurcated cervical ribs. Similar dorsal processes are present in the dicraeosaurid Dicraeosaurus. The presence of dorsal processes and bifurcated cervical ribs suggests that the hypaxial neck muscles that inserted on the cervical ribs were oriented in divergent directions. In all the dinosaurian examples we have found, the cervical ribs are maximally bifurcated in the middle of the cervical series. We hypothesize that bifurcated cervical ribs are traces of diverging neck muscles that provided improved control in the middle of the neck, at some distance from both the head and the trunk."

193,10.1002/jmor.20161,2013.0,Functional morphology of the fin rays of teleost fishes,"Ray‐finned fishes are notable for having flexible fins that allow for the control of fluid forces. A number of studies have addressed the muscular control, kinematics, and hydrodynamics of flexible fins, but little work has investigated just how flexible ray‐finned fish fin rays are, and how flexibility affects their response to environmental perturbations. Analysis of pectoral fin rays of bluegill sunfish showed that the more proximal portion of the fin ray is unsegmented while the distal 60% of the fin ray is segmented. We examined the range of motion and curvatures of the pectoral fin rays of bluegill sunfish during steady swimming, turning maneuvers, and hovering behaviors and during a vortex perturbation impacting the fin during the fin beat. Under normal swimming conditions, curvatures did not exceed 0.029 mm−1 in the proximal, unsegmented portion of the fin ray and 0.065 mm−1 in the distal, segmented portion of the fin ray. When perturbed by a vortex jet traveling at approximately 1 ms−1 (67 ± 2.3 mN s.e. of force at impact), the fin ray underwent a maximum curvature of 9.38 mm−1. Buckling of the fin ray was constrained to the area of impact and did not disrupt the motion of the pectoral fin during swimming. Flexural stiffness of the fin ray was calculated to be 565 × 10−6 Nm2. In computational fluid dynamic simulations of the fin‐vortex interaction, very flexible fin rays showed a combination of attraction and repulsion to impacting vortex dipoles. Due to their small bending rigidity (or flexural stiffness), impacting vortices transferred little force to the fin ray. Conversely, stiffer fin rays experienced rapid small‐amplitude oscillations from vortex impacts, with large impact forces all along the length of the fin ray. Segmentation is a key design feature of ray‐finned fish fin rays, and may serve as a means of making a flexible fin ray out of a rigid material (bone). This flexibility may offer intrinsic damping of environmental fluid perturbations encountered by swimming fish. J. Morphol. 274:1044–1059, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
194,10.1002/jmor.20738,2017.0,"Functional morphology of the gonoduct of the viviparous teleost Poeciliopsis gracilis (Heckel, 1848) (Poeciliidae)","Female teleosts do not develop Müllerian ducts; consequently, the ovary of teleosts contains two zones: germinal and gonoduct. The gonoduct lacks germinal cells, but has relevant functions in the reproductive process. We describe the functional morphology of the gonoduct in the viviparous teleost Poeciliopsis gracilis during nongestation and gestation stages. This study tests the hypothesis that the gonoduct functions as a barrier between the germinal zone and the exterior. By providing information about morphology and function of the gonoduct we show that this part of the ovary has an essential role in the reproduction of teleosts. The ovaries were processed by histological technique and stained with hematoxylin‐eosin (H‐E), Masson's trichrome, toluidine blue and periodic acid‐Schiff (PAS). The gonoduct is divided into three regions: cephalic, middle, and caudal. In the cephalic and middle regions there are mucosal folds that extend into the gonoductal lumen, forming structures similar to a cervix. The caudal region has two portions: the anterior contains a dorsal invagination and exocrine glands among columnar cells; the posterior has a ventral flexion and stratified epithelium with apical secretory cells. The morphology of this epithelium indicates two functions: (a) secretory by the apical columnar cells, and (b) protection through the stratification. Another peculiarity of the caudal region is that both ducts, reproductive and digestive, converge in a common cavity at their caudal ends, forming a cloacal region. The histology of the gonoduct indicates relevant functions including: (1) the control of the luminal diameter by the muscle and the presence of mucosal folds, like a cervix; (2) the relationship with the spermatozoa during insemination and storing them in mucosal folds; (3) the support of immunological processes; (4) secretory activities; (5) forming the duct during birth; and (6) possibly, acts as a barrier against parasite infestations."
195,10.1002/jmor.20221,2014.0,Comparative morphology of changeable skin papillae in octopus and cuttlefish,"A major component of cephalopod adaptive camouflage behavior has rarely been studied: their ability to change the three‐dimensionality of their skin by morphing their malleable dermal papillae. Recent work has established that simple, conical papillae in cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) function as muscular hydrostats; that is, the muscles that extend a papilla also provide its structural support. We used brightfield and scanning electron microscopy to investigate and compare the functional morphology of nine types of papillae of different shapes, sizes and complexity in six species: S. officinalis small dorsal papillae, Octopus vulgaris small dorsal and ventral eye papillae, Macrotritopus defilippi dorsal eye papillae, Abdopus aculeatus major mantle papillae, O. bimaculoides arm, minor mantle, and dorsal eye papillae, and S. apama face ridge papillae. Most papillae have two sets of muscles responsible for extension: circular dermal erector muscles arranged in a concentric pattern to lift the papilla away from the body surface and horizontal dermal erector muscles to pull the papilla's perimeter toward its core and determine shape. A third set of muscles, retractors, appears to be responsible for pulling a papilla's apex down toward the body surface while stretching out its base. Connective tissue infiltrated with mucopolysaccharides assists with structural support. S. apama face ridge papillae are different: the contraction of erector muscles perpendicular to the ridge causes overlying tissues to buckle. In this case, mucopolysaccharide‐rich connective tissue provides structural support. These six species possess changeable papillae that are diverse in size and shape, yet with one exception they share somewhat similar functional morphologies. Future research on papilla morphology, biomechanics and neural control in the many unexamined species of octopus and cuttlefish may uncover new principles of actuation in soft, flexible tissue. J.

196,10.17816/morph.631884,2024.0,Evaluation of the inflammatory response in the ovary after exposure to local electron irradiation and administration of platelet-rich plasma,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy for malignant neoplasms of the pelvic organs can lead to radiation-induced damage to healthy ovarian tissue with the development of premature ovarian failure and infertility. Research remains relevant to assess reactive changes in the ovaries in response to electron irradiation, as well as testing radioprotective agents, one of which is platelet-rich plasma. 
AIM: assessment of the inflammatory response in the ovary after administration of platelet-rich plasma in a model of radiation-induced ovarian failure. 
METHODS: Fragments of ovaries of four groups (I – Control (n=10), II – fractional irradiation with electrons in a total dose of 20 Gy (n=10), III – fractional irradiation with electrons in a total dose of 20 Gy + platelet-rich plasma (n=10) , IV – platelet-rich plasma (n=10)) were studied histologically and immunohistochemically with antibodies to pro- (IL-1, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines, as well as CD3 and CD20. 
RESULTS: According to the results of an immunohistochemical study, electron irradiation led to an increase in the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the number of CD3+ and CD20+ immunocompetent cells in the interstitial tissue of the ovaries, fractionally irradiated with electrons at a total dose of 20 Gy. A predominance of the T-cell component of immunity over the B-cell component was observed. At the same time, pre-irradiation administration of platelet-rich plasma contributed to a smaller change in the degree of morphological changes, the expression of pro- (IL-1, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines and the proportion of CD3+ and CD20+ immunocompetent cells in the interstitial tissue of the ovaries. At the same time, the predominance of the T-cell component of immunity was also noted. 
CONCLUSION: Components of platelet-rich plasma, having anti-inflammatory and radioprotective properties, reduce the severity of the inflammatory response (based on analysis of the expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and the number of T- and B-immunocompetent cells, which leads to a slowdown in the development of radiation-induced ovarian failure when exposed to fractional local irradiation with electrons in a total dose of 20 Gy."
197,10.31393/morphology-journal-2024-30(2)-09,2024.0,Morphological state of lungs of rats under the influence of Vipera berus berus venom,"About 5.4 million snake bite cases are registered worldwide every year. About half of them cause 81,000-138,000 deaths or disabled 400,000 people. Despite this, this problem is neglected in many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. It is believed that death from snakebites is associated with poverty since the lack of proper access to medical facilities in such sections of the population causes the development of fatal complications. The purpose of the study is to study the morphological state of rats' lungs under exposure to Vipera berus berus venom. Experimental studies were carried out on white, non-linear male rats. Animals were conditionally divided into control and experimental groups, ten individuals each. Experimental rats were injected intraperitoneally with a semi-lethal dose (LD50) (1.576 mg/g-1) of Vipera berus berus venom in a physiological solution. Animals of the control group were injected intraperitoneally with only a physiological solution. Rats were removed from the experiment 24 hours after exposure to the poison and anaesthetized by cervical dislocation. Lung tissue samples were taken for microscopic examination. Fixation of the material and preparation of paraffin blocks were carried out according to generally accepted methods. Staining of histological preparations of the lungs was carried out with hematoxylin and eosin, according to Masson, and the PAS+""Hale"" reaction was carried out according to the Mowry method. Histological preparations were studied using an SEO SСAN light microscope. The toxic effect of Vipera berus berus venom caused significant changes in the vascular, stromal and parenchymal components, which was confirmed by histological, histochemical and morphometric data. In the lungs of experimental animals, the vascular bed is primarily restructured, forming coagulopathies and thrombosis. The development of DIC syndrome and haemorrhages accompanies an increase in the permeability of the vessel wall. Inflammatory phenomena are found in the bronchi and respiratory departments' walls. There is a remodelling of the respiratory department components, with the formation of significant areas of dis- and atelectasis and zones of emphysema, which is confirmed morphometrically."
198,10.17816/morph.633191,2024.0,"Morphological analysis of wound healing with the use of aloe extract, hydrogel and their combination (experimental research)","BACKGROUND: Currently, there remains a high incidence of skin damage due to trauma, chronic diseases, burns, so it is important to study the issues of regeneration and treatment of skin wounds. 
AIM: Conduct a morphological analysis of wound healing when using aloe extract, hydrogel and their combination in the experiment. 
METHODS:. The subjects of the study were 40 mature guinea pigs, which were divided into control and 4 experimental groups (independent wound healing, application of aloe extract, hydrosorb gel, layer-by-layer application of drugs). Histological skin preparations were prepared on days 7, 14, and 28 of the experiment. In each microslide, in 10 fields of view of the microscope at a magnification of x50, morphometric parameters were measured in micrometers (µm): the thickness of the purulent-necrotic scab, inflammatory (leukocyte) infiltrate, granulation tissue, the length of the newly formed epithelium on days 7, 14; the thickness of the epithelium, its length and the thickness of the connective tissue in the central part of the regenerate on the 28th day. All data were subjected to statistical processing. 
RESULTS: The use of drugs led to a decrease in the inflammatory reaction, acceleration of the formation of granulation tissue, and partial epithelization of the wound by the 7th day of the experiment, however, more pronounced signs of wound healing were observed with layer-by-layer application of aloe extract and hydrogel. The use of medications, regardless of the method of application, showed signs of more effective wound healing by day 14. Thus, the length of the epithelium increased by 1.2-1.6 times, the depth of granulation tissue by 1-1.2 times compared to the control. By the end of the experiment, all animals had complete closure of the wound defect with the formation of a scar, but in the experimental groups of the study there were signs of remodeling of the skin with appendages. 
CONCLUSION: Morphological analysis showed that the use of aloe extract, hydrosorb gel and their combination accelerates the wound healing processes of full-thickness skin wounds in the experiment."

Entering the body with products of animal origin, methionine undergoes a number of biochemical transformations. Hyperhomocysteinemia has a negative effect on the body, causing damage to all organs and systems and leading to disruption of homeostasis. The study aims to study the characteristics of changes in the structure and immune processes of the spleen of young rats with chronic hyperhomocysteinemia. Experiments were performed on 22 white male rats. The animals were divided into control and experimental groups (11 individuals in each group) during the experiment. Chronic hyperhomocysteinemia was achieved by administering D, L-thiolactone homocysteine hydrochloride to experimental group animals at a dose of 200 mg/kg of body weight intragastrically in a 1 % starch gel solution once a day for eight weeks. After the end of the experimental simulation of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia, the animals were removed from the experiment by anaesthetising by decapitation and using thiopental anaesthesia. Histological preparations were studied using an SEO SСAN light microscope. Experimental modelling of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia in young rats was not accompanied by significant morphological changes in the stroma and red pulp of the spleen. T-cell periarterial sheaths and B-cell nodules in animals from the experimental group underwent changes. B-cell proliferation leads to growth within the white pulp, expansion of the marginal zones, which become more blurred and infiltration of these cells into the red pulp. Evaluation of the red pulp in the spleen of young rats from the experimental group showed a particular expansion in the venous sinuses, which may be a sign of reaction to the influence of homocysteine and slight swelling of these vessels. The number of T-cells in young animals in the periarterial cuffs is slightly reduced, which can be explained by the increasing activity of macrophages. However, T-cells also infiltrated the red pulp. Such penetration of white blood cells into the red pulp is accompanied by the expansion and “washing out” of the marginal zones of lymph nodes. Thus, the increased homocysteine level significantly potentiated proliferation and partially inhibited apoptosis in T-lymphocytes but did not directly affect dormant T-cells."

However, even small amounts of these additives can lead to diseases of various organs and systems. The aim of our work is to establish metrics and morphological changes in the structure of the capsule and the glomerular zone of the cortex of the adrenal glands of rats at the later stages of the experimental study under the conditions of consumption of a complex of food additives: monosodium glutamate, sodium nitrite and Ponceau 4R. The control group of rats consumed oral drinking water and saline. The rats of the experimental groups were orally administered once a day with a 10 % solution of sodium nitrite (E250), sodium glutamate (E621) or Ponceau 4R. The dosages of food additives were two times lower than the permissible norm in food. The rats were withdrawn from the experiment after 8, 12 and 16 weeks. The adrenal glands were removed for the study. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and semi-thin sections with toluidine blue, and examined using a light microscope Biorex with a digital microphoto attachment DSM 900. Ultrathin sections were examined in a TEM-125 K electron microscope. For morphometric analysis, the structure of the capsule and the glomerular zone of the cortex of the adrenal glands of rats at the later stages of the experimental study was studied. The study results were analysed using the software package “InStat”. At the late stages of the experimental study, the adrenal capsule underwent irreversible changes. The average thickness of the adrenal connective tissue capsule decreased by the end of the 16th week of the experimental research. Similarly, the average thickness of the cortex decreased with each subsequent week relative to the control values, indicating significant structural and functional disorders. The average thickness of the glomerular zone of the adrenal cortex periodically changed as a compensatory reaction in response to the administration of a complex of food additives to rats. The phenomena of nucleus pyknosis and sludge syndrome were detected, which indicated compensatory and adaptive processes at the microscopic level. The analysis of electron micrographs revealed destroyed granular endoplasmic reticulum cisternae and mitochondrial remnants. Thus, it has been established that using a complex of food additives (monosodium glutamate, sodium nitrite and Ponceau 4R) directly affects the adrenal glands of rats. This effect causes structural changes in the cortex and medulla, causing alteration and hypertrophy of cells in these areas. Additionally, hyperhydration of the connective tissue stroma and compensatory-restorative reactions aimed at transcription factors and internal mechanisms of nitric oxide formation were recorded."

The high incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and the convenience of its model-ing and morphological diagnosis pose an important task for experimental medicine to develop methods or its pathogenetic correction. The paper aimed to conduct a comprehensive immunomorphological study for endometrial hyperplasia against the background of excessive estrogens, select pathogenetic therapy, and evaluate its effectiveness. Materials and methods. We used laboratory Wistar rats (n=45), which were divided into the control (n=5) and experimental (n=40) groups. We created and verified a model of endometrial hyperplasia during ovariectomy and transdermal administration of estrogens. In the experimental group, the correction with indole, meloxicam, and polyoxidonium was performed. Immunohistochemical study of the expression of proliferation markers, apoptosis, various pools of immune cells, and vascular growth factor provided data on hyperplasia development mechanisms. Results. In this model, immunophenotypic changes differ in the parts responsible for gestation (the uterine horn) and expulsion of the fetus (analogous to the human cervix). Divergent disruptions of the cell cycle of epithelial cells and the topography of immunocompetent cells were revealed. Meloxicam normalizes most of these indicators (the number of immunocompetent cells and the kinetics of cell populations); indole has an antiestrogenic effect and increases the expression of progesterone receptors; and polyoxidonium is less effective in the correction of endometrial hyperplasia. Conclusion. The dynamics of the expression of the studied markers can be recommended for diagnosis, whereas the identified effects of drugs can be used for complex pathogenetic therapy."

The aim of our study was to establish the peculiarities of restructuring of the structural components of the pancreas under the conditions of long-time exposure to opioids in the experiment. The study included 24 adult laboratory white male rats. The test animals were divided into 2 groups, the experimental and control ones. The experimental animals were daily administered narcotic analgesic nalbuphine intramuscularly (once a day in the same interval) for four weeks, and the control animals were administered saline solution. The following research methods were used: bloodstream injection followed by translucence of sections of the pancreas and their photographing, morphometry of the vessels of the pancreatic hemomicrocirculatory bed, histological, histochemical studies and electron microscopy of the pancreas, blood biochemistry test; statistical processing of the study results using a software package. After four weeks of opioid exposure, lesion of the pancreatic parenchyma microstructure was observed, manifested by swelling and infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages of the pancreatic connective tissue stroma, disorganization of the exo- and endocrine parts of the parenchyma, deep destructive changes in the excretory ducts, as well as in the vessels of the hemo- and lympho-microcirculatory bed of the pancreas. At the ultrastructural level, deep dystrophic changes of exo- and endocrinocytes of the pancreas were identified, in particular, loss of regular shape, karyopyknosis and karyorrhexis of the nuclei, swelling and clearing of cytoplasm, development of microcystic degeneration of cells, loosening and disorganization of the basement membrane, which can result in impairment of exocrine function of the pancreas and complication of the process of secretory granules excretion into the lumen of the intercalated ducts. A significant decrease, compared to the control group, in the diameter of arterioles, density of exchange vessels network, as well as increase in the diameter of venules, the indicator of trophic activity of the tissue, are the evidence of destructive changes in the hemomicrocirculatory bed of the pancreas under the effects of nalbuphine. Significant changes in blood biochemistry parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) after a four-week administration of nalbuphine are illustrative of the process of pancreatic tissue destruction. Therefore, four-week administration of opioid leads to profound changes in the micro- and ultrastructure of the pancreas, vessels of its hemomicrocirculatory bed, and blood biochemistry parameters in experimental white rats."
203,,2014.0,Understanding Relationships Between Morphology and Charge Transfer States in Organic Photovoltaics,"Author(s): Liman, Christopher | Advisor(s): Chabinyc, Michael L | Abstract: Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important as the world's energy demands continue to grow and climate change continues to occur. Photovoltaic power generation has great potential, but most commercial photovoltaic cells have typically been made from single-crystal or polycrystalline silicon which are expensive and energy intensive to produce. Organic semiconductors are one class of solar cell materials that have the potential for low cost due to solution processability, roll-to-roll fabrication, material tunability, and the very small amounts of material required to absorb light compared to crystalline silicon. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiencies have increased rapidly in the past few years and are currently at about 11% power conversion efficiency.To find new pathways to improve OPV performance, a deeper understanding of the relationships between morphology, electronic properties, and OPV performance is required. This work will explore these relationships, focusing on the relationship between morphology and charge transfer states. We focus on a small molecule material system with only pure donor and acceptor domains, unlike the typical bulk heterojunction composed of donor, acceptor, and mixed domains. The advantage of studying this system is a more well-defined interfacial area and simpler morphology that allows us to better characterize charge transfer states at the donor-acceptor interface.We first review the basic principles of OPV operation, fabrication and characterization methods, and charge transfer states. We then use grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering to characterize the crystal structures and textures of the polymorphs of the donor and acceptor in our small molecule system, which are important for understanding their blend morphology. Next, we demonstrate a new method to control morphology in this system with the use of a thermally degradable binder polymer. Afterwards, we vary interfacial area and charge transfer state density in this system through processing and characterize it using sub-bandgap external quantum efficiency measurements, allowing us to gain valuable insights about the photophysics of this system.Finally, many of the insights and techniques used to study this system are also useful in studying other systems of organic or solution-procesed semiconductors. We optimize the morphology and performance of OPVs made with novel low-bandgap donor-acceptor copolymers. We then find that ionic photoconductivity plays an important role in the behavior of photodetectors made with solution processed amorphous ZnO and in their interaction with organic semiconductors."
204,10.1039/c9ee03710a,2020.0,Over 17% efficiency ternary organic solar cells enabled by two non-fullerene acceptors working in an alloy-like model,"Nowadays, organic solar cells (OSCs) with Y6 and its derivatives as electron acceptors provide the highest efficiencies among the studied binary OSCs. To further improve the performances of OSCs, the fabrication of ternary OSCs (TOSCs) is a convenient strategy. Essentially, morphology control and the trade-off between voltage and photocurrent are the main critical issues in TOSCs. Herein, we address these problems by constructing TOSCs where an alloy-like composite is formed between Y6 and a newly designed derivative, BTP-M. Employing an electron-pushing methyl substituent as a replacement for the electron-withdrawing F atoms on Y6, BTP-M shows higher energy levels and lower crystallinity than Y6. As a result, the obtained Y6:BTP-M alloy can simultaneously optimize energy levels to reduce energy loss as well as the morphologies of the active layers to favor photocurrent generation, leading to an enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.875 V together with a larger short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.56 mA cm−2 for TOSCs based on the polymer donor PM6 and Y6:BTP-M acceptor alloy. Consequently, a best efficiency of 17.03% is achieved for the corresponding TOSCs, which is among the best values for single-junction OSCs. In addition, our TOSCs also exhibit good thickness tolerance, and can reach 14.23% efficiency even though the active layer is as thick as 300 nm."
205,10.1002/jmor.20401,2015.0,"Morphology, microstructure, crystallography, and chemistry of distinct CaCO3 deposits formed by early recruits of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis","Scleractinian corals begin their biomineralization process shortly after larval settlement with the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) structures at the interface between the larval tissues and the substrate. The newly settled larvae exert variable degrees of control over this skeleton formation, providing an opportunity to study a range of biocarbonate structures, some of which are transient and not observed in adult coral skeletons. Here we present a morphological, structural, crystallographic, and chemical comparison between two types of aragonite deposits observed during the skeletal development of 2‐days old recruits of Pocillopora damicornis: (1) Primary septum and (2) Abundant, dumbbell‐like structures, quasi‐randomly distributed between initial deposits of the basal plate and not present in adult corals—At the mesoscale level, initial septa structures are formed by superimposed fan‐shaped fasciculi consisting of bundles of fibers, as also observed in adult corals. This organization is not observed in the dumbbell‐like structures. However, at the ultrastructural level there is great similarity between septa and dumbbell components. Both are composed of <100 nm granular units arranged into larger single‐crystal domains.Chemically, a small difference is observed between the septae with an average Mg/Ca ratio around 11 mmol/mol and the dumbbell‐like structures with ca. 7 mmol/mol; Sr/Ca ratios are similar in the two structures at around 8 mmol/mol—Overall, the observed differences in distribution, morphology, and chemistry between septa, which are highly conserved structures fundamental to the architecture of the skeleton, and the transient, dumbbell‐like structures, suggest that the latter might be formed through less controlled biomineralization processes. Our observations emphasize the inherent difficulties involved in distinguishing different biomineralization pathways based on ultrastructural and crystallographical observations. J.

The experiment was carried out on white outbred rats weighing 180-250. A total of 50 animals were involved in the experiment. All animals were divided into 5 groups: control and 4 experimental. All animals of the experimental groups were subjected to inhalation effects of gasoline and formaldehyde vapors, in the 1st (control) group, only poisoning with ecotoxicants was used, in the 2nd group, against the background of poisoning with ecotoxicants, peptinsorbent was used, in the 3rd group - a membrane protector - magnolia vine, in the 4th group beets, in the 5th experimental group - peptinsorbent, membrane protector and beets. 
The structure of the liver of rat pups born from female rats subjected to subchronic poisoning with gasoline and formaldehyde throughout pregnancy has pronounced pathomorphological signs characteristic of hepatosis, turning into toxic hepatitis. The use of lemongrass, peptinsorbent and beetroot separately, along with intoxication of pregnant rats, somewhat reduced the degree of pathomorphological changes in the liver of born rats, but not drastically. Against the background of using a combined mixture (peptinsorbent + lemongrass ""membrane protector"" + beetroot) in subsequently born rat pups, the structure of the liver is relatively better than in the control group, with the exception of certain areas of the liver, in which hemostasis and moderately pronounced dystrophic changes in hepatocytes are detected. Based on the results of the experimental study, it can be concluded that the combined mixture (peptinsorbent + lemongrass ""membranoprotector"" + beetroot) is effective as a hepatoprotective agent for liver damage by ecotoxicants."

Experimental studies on mice and rats demonstrated that microplastics can enter the internal environment, causing structural damage to and dysfunction of various organs. However, data on this issue are scarce and contradictory. The aim of this paper was to characterize morphological changes in the internal organs in mice after prolonged MP consumption in different doses. Materials and methods. We formed four groups (n=5 each): three experimental and one control group. Mice of the experimental groups were given a 5-μm polystyrene particle suspension in distilled water at a concentration of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/l for 4 weeks. The daily consumption doses averaged 0.023, 0.23, and 2.3 mg of microparticles per kg of animal body weight, respectively. The control group received distilled water throughout the experiment. We conducted a morphological examination of the colon, spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, brain, heart, testicles, and thigh muscles. In the colon, morphometric methods were used to evaluate inflammatory infiltration, the number of endocrine and goblet cells, and the content of neutral and highly sulfated mucins in the latter. Results. On morphological examination under the influence of 5-μm polystyrene particle consumption in different doses, we revealed pathological changes only in the spleen and colon. However, a decrease in the goblet cell volume fraction in the colon mucosa was found in the group with low dose of microplastics (0.023 mg/kg/day). The group that consumed 2.3 mg/kg/day of microplastics showed the activation of both spleen compartments, an increased endocrine cells count, and a decreased proportion of highly sulfated mucins in goblet cells. Conclusion. Polystyrene microparticles with a 5-μm diameter consumed for 4 weeks at doses of 0.023–2.3 mg/kg/day cause adaptive morphological and functional changes in the colon and spleen.

208,10.31393/morphology-journal-2023-29(3)-07,2023.0,Changes in the microscopic organisation of rat adrenal glands under the influence of Vipera berus berus venom,"Snakebite envenoming is a common but neglected public health problem worldwide. Annual mortality as a result of snakebites exceeds 138,000. The organs of the endocrine system are among the first to react to the effects of snake and viper toxins. Under these conditions, the adrenal glands are involved in the pathological process and contribute to the formation of the adaptation syndrome, undergoing complex structural changes. The research aims to study the changes in the microscopic organization of the adrenal glands of rats under the influence of Vipera berus berus venom. Experimental studies were carried out on white non-linear male rats. The animals were conditionally divided into a control and an experimental group of 10 individuals. Experimental rats were injected intraperitoneally in a saline solution with a semi-lethal dose (LD50) (1.576 mg/g-1) of Vipera berus berus venom. Animals of the control group were injected intraperitoneally with only saline solution. Rats were removed from the experiment 24 hours after exposure to the venom and anaesthetized by decapitation. Adrenal gland samples were taken for microscopic examination. Fixation of the material and preparation of paraffin blocks were carried out according to generally accepted methods. Histological preparations of the adrenal glands were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological preparations were studied using an SEO SСAN light microscope. Under the influence of Vipera berus berus venom in zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, moderately pronounced pathological changes were found, including vacuolization and granularity of the cytoplasm of endocrinocytes, loss of precise contours of nuclei, their hyperchromasia, expansion of lumens of sinusoidal capillaries, accumulation of erythrocytes in them. Under these conditions, zona fasciculata is characterized by significant cell granularity and perinuclear edema. Less pronounced structural organization changes were noted in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. Endocrinocytes of this zone had small sizes, eosinophilic cytoplasm and dark nuclei. In the medulla of the adrenal glands, the cells were large in size and had indistinct contours, the cytoplasm was characterized by basophilic granularity, and the nuclei were light due to the predominance of euchromatin. The most pronounced effect of Vipera berus berus venom was on the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex; most of the morphological signs of pathology in which were caused by a violation of protein metabolism in the cells of the parenchymal and stromal elements of this organ."
209,10.17816/morph.623166,2023.0,Morphofunctional characteristics of the pancreas after administration of N-acetylcysteine in an acute post-radiation pancreatitis model,"BACKGROUND: The development of effective methods of non-drug and drug protection of humans and animals from the effects of ionizing radiation remains relevant. It is necessary to conduct a morphofunctional assessment of changes in the pancreatic parenchyma and identify the degree of radiosensitization of acinocytes and insulocytes outside the tumor, as well as during electron therapy of cancer of neighboring organs, such as the colon, stomach, etc. 
AIM: morphological assessment of the pancreas after administration of N-acetylcysteine in a model of acute radiation-induced pancreatitis. 
METHODS: Wistar rats (Rattus Wistar; n=40) were divided into four experimental groups: I control (n=10); II (n=10) fractional irradiation with electrons in a total irradiation dose of 25 Gy; III (n=10) administration of N-acetylcysteine before electron irradiation; IV (n=10) administration of N-acetylcysteine. Animals of all groups (I IV) were removed from the experiment a week after the last fraction. 
RESULTS: A week after electron irradiation in group II, a disturbance in histoarchitecture was observed, due to the presence of signs of acute post-radiation pancreatitis. This was accompanied by increases in glucose, amylase and malondialdehyde levels, as well as decreases in insulin and superoxide dismutase levels. During the administration of N-acetylcysteine in group III, less pronounced depth and range of damage to the pancreas was noted. 
CONCLUSION: As a result of the morphofunctional study of the pancreas after irradiation with electrons against the background of the administration of N-acetylcysteine, it can be considered quite reasonable to conclude that it is advisable to conduct further studies of the protective effects of this drug when exposed to ionizing radiation using immunohistochemical, molecular genetic and other methods."
210,10.17816/morph.508661,2023.0,MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR FEATURES OF DECIDUAL ENDOMETRIAL CELLS IN CASE OF MISCARRIAGES,"Decidualization is a dynamic, multi-step process that differentiates elongated endometrial stromal cells into round, epithelioid-like decidual cells in response to rising progesterone levels. Decidual stromal cells play an important role throughout pregnancy by creating a tolerant microenvironment, the decidua, to suppress the maternal immune response and prevent rejection of the allogeneic fetus. Along with this, decidualization plays an important role not only in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, prevention of early losses, modulation of the immune response, but also in the control of the onset of labor, regulation of trophoblast invasion, and embryo selection. They have immunomodulatory properties in relation to cells of innate and adaptive immunity. Pregnancy maintenance requires selective elimination of pro-inflammatory senescent decidual cells by activated uterine NK cells. 
 Data on various populations of decidualizing endometrial stromal cells are presented and three subtypes of them with different functional characteristics are distinguished: predecidual, decidual, transitional and senescent subpopulations. 
An increase in the number of the latter with a pro-inflammatory phenotype leads to pregnancy losses. This review analyzes the literature data on decidualization and its role in the genesis of miscarriage and highlights the important contribution of decidual stromal cells to the microenvironment and their direct or indirect influence on the recruitment, distribution and function of immune cells, on the remodeling of the extracellular matrix and the formation of the placenta. When preparing the review, a search was made for publications in the scientific databases of the RSCI, Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Sience and Google Scholar for the period 2013-2023."
211,10.31393/morphology-journal-2023-29(4)-05,2023.0,Peculiarities of the microscopic structure of rat testis under the influence of Vipera berus berus venom,"Morpho-functional changes in the organs of the male reproductive system are usually associated with injuries, infectious diseases, age, lifestyle, the presence of bad habits (abuse of alcohol, drugs), the influence of environmental factors, etc. However, the action of natural toxins, in particular those that are components of animal venoms, including the venoms of snakes and vipers, is no less important. The aim of the research is to study the features of the microscopic structure of the testis of rats under the influence of Vipera berus berus venom. Experimental studies were carried out on white non-linear male rats. Animals were conditionally divided into two groups – control and experimental, 10 individuals in each. Experimental rats were injected intraperitoneally with a semi-lethal dose (LD50) (1.576 mg/g-1) of Vipera berus berus venom in physiological solution. Animals of the control group were injected intraperitoneally with only saline solution. Rats were removed from the experiment 24 hours after exposure of the venom, anesthetized by cervical dislocation. Testis samples were taken for microscopic examination. Fixation of the material and preparation of paraffin blocks were carried out according to generally accepted methods. Staining of histological preparations of the testis was carried out with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological preparations were studied using a SEO SСAN light microscope. Administration of Vipera berus berus venom to rats leads to the development of pathogistological changes in the parenchymal elements of the testis of animals, among which desquamation and disorganization of all stages of spermatogenic cells development, disruption of spermatogenesis processes were the most pronounced. Spermatogenic cells of the seminiferous tubules of the testis were distinguished by changes in morphology and location, lost the regularity of their placement, and their number decreased. The cells detached from the basement membrane and did not form a continuous layer. A characteristic feature was the presence of clusters of erythrocytes in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, which may indicate the development of hemorrhagic complications. In addition, an increase in the number of Leydig cells was detected, which is probably the cause of changes in the hormonal regulation of the organ's function."
212,10.1093/nsr/nwz200,2019.0,Organic photovoltaic cell with 17% efficiency and superior processability,"Abstract The development of organic photoactive materials, especially the newly emerging non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs), has enabled rapid progress in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in recent years. Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the top-performance OPV cells have surpassed 16%, the devices are usually fabricated via a spin-coating method and are not suitable for large-area production. Here, we demonstrate that the fine-modification of the flexible side chains of NFAs can yield 17% PCE for OPV cells. More crucially, as the optimal NFA has a suitable solubility and thus a desirable morphology, the high efficiencies of spin-coated devices can be maintained when using scalable blade-coating processing technology. Our results suggest that optimization of the chemical structures of the OPV materials can improve device performance. This has great significance in larger-area production technologies that provide important scientific insights for the commercialization of OPV cells."

First, the problem is formulated, in which the tracking target is selected as varying-amplitude and biased-measured. Then, the process of the ILC algorithm based on a variable-gain-proportional-integral scheme is discussed, in which the magnitude coefficient is defined and calculated by orthogonal projection and utilised to redefine the error and build the refreshment algorithm of the input. Next, the convergence of the algorithm is analysed and the applicational simulation is conducted. Results show that the new ILC algorithm has the ability in dealing with the trajectory of the varying but morphologically similar target and the applicational scenario of the ILC algorithm is expanded."

In order to achieve the best possible performance, it is critical to understand how organic semiconductors nucleate and grow. Clever use of surface and dielectric modification chemistry can allow one to control the growth and morphology, which greatly influence the electrical properties of the organic transistor. In this Review, the nucleation and growth of organic semiconductors on dielectric surfaces is addressed. The first part of the Review concentrates on small‐molecule organic semiconductors. The role of deposition conditions on film formation is described. The modification of the dielectric interface using polymers or self‐assembled monolayers and their effect on organic‐semiconductor growth and performance is also discussed. The goal of this Review is primarily to discuss the thin‐film formation of organic semiconducting species. The patterning of single crystals is discussed, while their nucleation and growth has been described elsewhere (see the Review by Liu et. al). 1 The second part of the Review focuses on polymeric semiconductors. The dependence of physico‐chemical properties, such as chain length (i.e., molecular weight) of the constituting macromolecule, and the influence of small molecular species on, e.g., melting temperature, as well as routes to induce order in such macromolecules, are described."

It has been demonstrated that they can be manufactured on fl exible substrates and at low cost over large areas using the high volume technique of roll-to-roll printing. [ 1–3 ] Whilst much work has been devoted to the donoracceptor system P3HT:PCBM (poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester), attention is now turning to the use of donor materials which have a reduced energy gap (permitting more of the sun’s spectral emission to be harvested) and an increased ionization potential (leading to an increased open-circuit voltage and thus greater power conversion effi ciency [ 4 , 5 ] ). One promising new donor polymer for OPV applications is PCDTBT (poly [N-9 ′ -heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4 ′ ,7 ′ -di2-thienyl-2 ′ ,1 ′ ,3 ′ -benzothiadiazole)] whose chemical structure is shown in Figure 1 .

An evaluation of roll-to-roll processed indium and silver free polymer solar cells has been carried out from different perspectives: life cycle assessment, cost analysis and layer quality evaluation using inline optical and functional inspection tools. The polymer solar cells were fabricated in credit card sized modules by three routes, and several encapsulation alternatives have been explored, with the aim to provide the simplest but functional protection against moisture and oxygen, which could deteriorate the performance of the cells. The analysis shows that ITO- and silver-free options are clearly advantageous in terms of energy embedded over the traditional modules, and that encapsulation must balance satisfying the protection requirements while having at the same time a low carbon footprint. From the economic perspective there is a huge reduction in the cost of the ITO- and silver-free options, reaching as low as 0.25 € for the OPV module. We used inspection tools such as a roll-to-roll inspection system to evaluate all processing steps during the fabrication and analyse the layers' quality and forecast whether a module will work or not and establish any misalignment of the printed pattern or defects in the layers that can affect the performance of the devices. This has been found to be a good tool to control the process and to increase the yield."
218,10.1039/d2mh00376g,2022.0,Toward high-performance organic photovoltaics: the new cooperation of sequential solution-processing and promising non-fullerene acceptors.,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have long been a hot topic due to their light weight, low cost, and flexibility. Simple blend-based OPVs have sufficient donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces and high exciton dissociation efficiency, which result in certified high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. However, the difficult morphology control and poor device stability limit further progress toward higher PCE and future application. Sequential solution-processing with tunable vertical phase distribution, D/A interfaces, and charge transportation pathways not only benefit device stability but can also overcome the up-scaling challenge. In recent years, the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has been very rapid, which is attributed to their tunable energy levels, bandgaps, planarity, and crystallinity. In this minireview, the opportunities for the cooperation of sequential solution-processing and NFAs are revealed based on their characteristics, such as diverse molecular shapes, abundant functional groups and heteroatoms, and various aggregation states for NFAs; independent active layer processing, controllable D/A interfaces, and excellent device stability for sequential solution-processing. Few but important existing examples are discussed to display the prospects of sequential solution-processed fullerene-free OPVs toward high PCE, good device stability, high semitransparency, and large-area industrial manufacture. Finally, some possible research directions are predicted and the main issues that need to be overcome are proposed for sequential solution-processed fullerene-free OPVs toward higher performance."

We also review the mixed‐solvent effects on the dynamics of film evolution in selected polymer‐blend systems, which facilitate the formation of optimal percolation paths and therefore provide a simple approach to improve photovoltaic performance. Recently, the occurrence of vertical phase separation has been found in some polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunctions. 1–3 The origin and applications of this inhomogeneous distribution of the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor are addressed.

However, because the performance of OPV devices is still disappointing compared to their inorganic counterparts, better understanding of how controlling the molecular-level morphology can impact performance is needed. To this end, one has to overcome significant challenges that stem from the complexity and heterogeneity of the underlying electronic structure and molecular morphology. In this Letter, we address this challenge in the context of the DBP/C70 OPV system by employing a modular workflow that combines recent advances in electronic structure, molecular dynamics, and rate theory. We show how the wide range of interfacial pairs can be classified into four types of interfacial donor-acceptor geometries and find that the least populated interfacial geometry gives rise to the fastest charge transfer (CT) rates."

Well known examples include light-induced degradation in Si-based cell (Staebler-Wronski effect), Cu diffusion in thin film (copper indium gallium selenide) cell, hot-spot degradation in series connected modules, etc. Here we develop a compact model for an intrinsic degradation concern for bulk heterojunction type organic photovoltaic (BH-OPV) cells that involve continued (thermal) phase segregation of the donor-acceptor molecules leading to characteristic loss of efficiency and performance. Our approach interprets a number of BH-OPV device degradation measurements within a common framework and suggests/rationalizes intuitive routes for lifetime improvement for such technologies."

Using gross morphology, histological sectioning, and X‐ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM), we investigated structural, behavioral, and mechanical aspects of pharyngeal jaw function in black carp. Strut‐like trabeculae in their pharyngeal jaws support large, molariform teeth. The teeth occlude with a hypertrophied basioccipital process that is also reinforced with stout trabeculae. A keratinous chewing pad is firmly connected to the basioccipital process by a series of small bony projections from the base of the pedestal. The pharyngeal jaws have no bony articulations with the skull, and their position is controlled by five paired muscles and one unpaired median muscle. Black carp can crush large molluscs, so we used XROMM to compare pharyngeal jaw postures as fish crushed ceramic tubes of increasing sizes. We found that black carp increase pharyngeal jaw gape primarily by ventral translation of the jaws, with ventral rotation and lateral flaring of the jaws also increasing the space available to accommodate large prey items. A stout, robust ligament connects left and right jaws together firmly, but allows some rotation of the jaws relative to each other. Contrasting with the pharyngeal jaw mechanism of durophagous perciforms with fused left and right lower pharyngeal jaws, we hypothesize that this ligamentous connection may serve to decouple tensile and compressive forces, with the tensile forces borne by the ligament and the compressive forces transferred to the prey.

224,10.1021/ja5110602,2015.0,A rhodanine flanked nonfullerene acceptor for solution-processed organic photovoltaics.,"A novel small molecule, FBR, bearing 3-ethylrhodanine flanking groups was synthesized as a nonfullerene electron acceptor for solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPV). A straightforward synthesis route was employed, offering the potential for large scale preparation of this material. Inverted OPV devices employing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor polymer and FBR as the acceptor gave power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 4.1%. Transient and steady state optical spectroscopies indicated efficient, ultrafast charge generation and efficient photocurrent generation from both donor and acceptor. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate polaron generation efficiency as well as recombination dynamics. It was determined that the P3HT:FBR blend is highly intermixed, leading to increased charge generation relative to comparative devices with P3HT:PC60BM, but also faster recombination due to a nonideal morphology in which, in contrast to P3HT:PC60BM devices, the acceptor does not aggregate enough to create appropriate percolation pathways that prevent fast nongeminate recombination. Despite this nonoptimal morphology the P3HT:FBR devices exhibit better performance than P3HT:PC60BM devices, used as control, demonstrating that this acceptor shows great promise for further optimization."
225,10.1002/smll.202107834,2022.0,Improving Thermal and Photostability of Polymer Solar Cells by Robust Interface Engineering.,"As the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) approaches 19%, increasing research attention is being paid to enhancing the device's long-term stability. In this study, a robust interface engineering of graphene oxide nanosheets (GNS) is expounded on improving the thermal and photostability of non-fullerene bulk-heterojunction (NFA BHJ) OPVs to a practical level. Three distinct GNSs (GNS, N-doped GNS (N-GNS), and N,S-doped GNS (NS-GNS)) synthesized through a pyrolysis method are applied as the ZnO modifier in inverted OPVs. The results reveal that the GNS modification introduces passivation and dipole effects to enable better energy-level alignment and to facilitate charge transfer across the ZnO/BHJ interface. Besides, it optimizes the BHJ morphology of the photoactive layer, and the N,S doping of GNS further enhances the interaction with the photoactive components to enable a more idea BHJ morphology. Consequently, the NS-GNS device delivers enhanced performance from 14.5% (control device) to 16.5%. Moreover, the thermally/chemically stable GNS is shown to stabilize the morphology of the ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) and to endow the BHJ morphology of the photoactive layer grown atop with a more stable thermodynamic property. This largely reduces the microstructure changes and the associated charge recombination in the BHJ layer under constant thermal/light stresses. Finally, the NS-GNS device is demonstrated to exhibit an impressive T80 lifetime (time at which PCE of the device decays to 80% of the initial PCE) of 2712 h under a constant thermal condition at 65 °C in a glovebox and an outstanding photostability with a T80 lifetime of 2000 h under constant AM1.5G 1-sun illumination in an N2 -controlled environment."
226,10.3389/fchem.2023.1326131,2023.0,Single-component organic solar cells—Perspective on the importance of chemical precision in conjugated block copolymers,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) present a promising thin-film solar cell technology with particular benefits in terms of weight, aesthetics, transparency, and cost. However, despite being studied intensively since the mid 90's, OPV has not entered the mass consumer market yet. Although the efficiency gap with other thin-film photovoltaics has largely been overcome, active layer stability and performance reproducibility issues have not been fully resolved. State-of-the-art OPV devices employ a physical mixture of electron donor and acceptor molecules in a bulk heterojunction active layer. These blends are prone to morphological changes, leading to performance losses over time. On the other hand, in “single-component” organic solar cells, the donor and acceptor constituents are chemically connected within a single material, preventing demixing and thereby enhancing device stability. Novel single-component materials affording reasonably high solar cell efficiencies and improved lifetimes have recently emerged. In particular, the combination of donor and acceptor structures in conjugated block copolymers (CBCs) presents an exciting approach. Nevertheless, the current CBCs are poorly defined from a structural point of view, while synthetic protocols remain unoptimized. More controlled synthesis followed by proper structural analysis of CBCs is, however, essential to develop rational structure-property-device relations and to drive the field forward. In this perspective, we provide a short overview of the state-of-the-art in single-component organic solar cells prepared from CBCs, reflect on their troublesome characterization and the importance of chemical precision in these structures, give some recommendations, and discuss the potential impact of these aspects on the field."

Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single‐junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide‐bandgap polymer donor named PBQx‐TF and a new low‐bandgap non‐fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9‐2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F‐BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open‐circuit voltage of 0.879 V, short‐circuit current density of 26.7 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high‐performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers."
228,,1975.0,The hormonal control and morphology of blastocyst invasion in the mouse uterus.,"When mature and immature uteri from ovariectomized mice were cultured in chemically defined media, blastocyst invasion occurred in the presence of progesterone but not in media containing only oestradiol. The invaded stromal tissue did not decidualize unless the uteri were taken from mice pretreated with progesterone and oestradiol. Fibrillar material was, however, concentrated in the stromal tissue adjacent to the invasive trophoblast. Neither progesterone nor oestradiol, had any ultrastructural effect on the endometrium of cultured uteri from ovariectomized mice, other than closure of uterine lumina in the presence of progesterone. Embryogenesis became abnormal, probably owing to the failure of formation of a suitable implantation chamber."

While the vagina conforms to the concave type, the study reveals a new orientation of seminal receptacle compartments. The seminal receptacle consists of two chambers, which are oriented in anterior‐posterior direction. This is in contrast to the dorso‐ventral orientation of seminal receptacle chambers in all other known brachyuran crabs. The anterior chamber is lined by cuticle, whereas the posterior chamber is covered with a holocrine glandular epithelium. The oviduct connection is located ventrally, close to the opening of the vagina. The oviduct orifice is characterized by a transition of the epithelium lining of the oviduct to the seminal receptacle holocrine glandular epithelium. Special features are muscle fibers, which are attached to the oviduct orifice and to the sternal cuticle as well. The muscle fibers can be found exactly at that point where the oviduct opens into the seminal receptacle and are secondly attached to the sternum beneath. This musculature is newly described for Eubrachyuran crabs. This musculature can be interpreted as an important feature in the fertilization and egg‐laying process in relation to supporting and controling the inflow of eggs into the seminal receptacle lumen. These new discoveries were compared to the known pattern of an Eubrachyuran seminal receptacle. J. Morphol. 276:517–525, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The glands are subcutaneous masses in the proximal base of each clasper. They are partially bilobate organs with a ventral groove that bears a row of papillae. Glands tend to be asymmetric, the left gland has a larger size, a trend that has been observed in other organs of elasmobranchs. Glands are formed by radially organized tubular secretory units lined with a simple columnar epithelium with basal nuclei and granular eosinophilic cytoplasm; vascularized loose connective tissue surrounds the gland units. The gland is covered by two layers of striated muscle tissue in circular and longitudinal arrangement. The clasper glands begin to develop in neonates and their secretory activity begins in juveniles. The active secretion of the clasper gland is observed in mature males, it includes glycoproteins and sulfated mucopolysaccharides. The size of the glands has a positive and direct relationship with body size, measured as disc width. Significant differences in clasper gland size were found between mature (active and resting) and immature (neonates and juveniles) males, suggesting that the acquisition of the sexual maturity involves the increase in the size of the gland due to a highly augmented secretory activity. Therefore, clasper glands are clearly associated with the reproductive activity of males and their secretion should have an endocrine control as other sexual secondary organs. J.

231,10.3390/AGRONOMY11061152,2021.0,Semi-Transparent Organic Photovoltaics Applied as Greenhouse Shade for Spring and Summer Tomato Production in Arid Climate,"Recognizing the growing interest in the application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with greenhouse crop production systems, in this study we used flexible, roll-to-roll printed, semi-transparent OPV arrays as a roof shade for a greenhouse hydroponic tomato production system during a spring and summer production season in the arid southwestern U.S. The wavelength-selective OPV arrays were installed in a contiguous area on a section of the greenhouse roof, decreasing the transmittance of all solar radiation wavelengths and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) wavelengths (400–700 nm) to the OPV-shaded area by approximately 40% and 37%, respectively. Microclimate conditions and tomato crop growth and yield parameters were measured in both the OPV-shaded (‘OPV’) and non-OPV-shaded (‘Control’) sections of the greenhouse. The OPV shade stabilized the canopy temperature during midday periods with the highest solar radiation intensities, performing the function of a conventional shading method. Although delayed fruit development and ripening in the OPV section resulted in lower total yields compared to the Control section (24.6 kg m−2 and 27.7 kg m−2, respectively), after the fourth (of 10 total) harvests, the average weekly yield, fruit number, and fruit mass were not significantly different between the treatment (OPV-shaded) and control group. Light use efficiency (LUE), defined as the ratio of total fruit yield to accumulated PAR received by the plant canopy, was nearly twice as high as the Control section, with 21.4 g of fruit per mole of PAR for plants in the OPV-covered section compared to 10.1 g in the Control section. Overall, this study demonstrated that the use of semi-transparent OPVs as a seasonal shade element for greenhouse production in a high-light region is feasible. However, a higher transmission of PAR and greater OPV device efficiency and durability could make OPV shades more economically viable, providing a desirable solution for co-located greenhouse crop production and renewable energy generation in hot and high-light intensity regions."

Endodontic orthograde retreatment was performed and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was placed as apical plug and to repair the large internal resorption. In order to re-establish the biologic width, a controlled surgical crown-lengthening procedure was performed. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 in the gingival tissue was used as a biomarker for the presence of inflammation in the hypertrophied gingiva. The one-year control revealed the cessation of the resorptive activities and the stability of the periodontium. The choice for a conservative combined treatment was essential in maintaining the affected teeth in an esthetically challenging area."

However, the lack of efficient tools to endow CPNFs with morphological stability and surface tailorability becomes a frustrating hindrance for expanding application spectrum of CPNFs. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate length-controllable OPV-based (OPV = oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)) CPNFs containing a cross-linked shell with high morphological stability and facile surface tailorability through the combination of living CDSA and thiol-ene chemistry by using OPV5 -b-PNAAM32 (PNAAM = poly(N-allyl acrylamide)) as a model. Uniform fiber-like micelles with tunable length can be generated by self-seeding of living CDSA. By taking advantage of radical thoil-ene reaction between vinyls of PNAAM corona and four-arm thiols, the shell of micelles can be cross-linked with negligible destruction of structure of vinylene-containing OPV core. The resulting micelles show high morphological stability in NaCl solution and PBS buffer, even upon heating at 80 °C. The introduced extra thiol groups in the cross-linked shell can be further employed to install extra functional moieties via convenient thiol-Michael-type reaction. Given the negligible cytotoxicity of resulting CPNFs, this strategy opens an avenue to fabricate various CPNFs of diverse functionalities for biomedicine. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, morphological modification in non‐fullerene blends is demonstrated to boost the efficiency and stability of indoor OPVs. For morphological modification, a ternary blend is devised by utilizing two well‐miscible non‐fullerene acceptors, which improve morphological features in the photoactive layer and suppress charge recombination loss. Morphological modification enhances OPV performance, particularly under low‐intensity indoor irradiation conditions, at which trap‐assisted recombination mainly governs the photovoltaic performance. The optimum ternary OPV shows a new record power conversion efficiency of 30.11% at a 500 lux light‐emitting diode, accompanied by excellent morphological durability under thermal stress, despite the use of “existing” photovoltaic materials designed for AM 1.5 G operation. This study elucidates the effects of morphology on OPV performance under low‐light conditions and suggests an ideal morphology for non‐fullerene OPVs with enhanced performance for indoor applications."

Using these criteria, we have investigated the class of 1,8-di(R)octanes with various functional groups (R) as processing additives for BHJ solar cells. Control of the BHJ morphology by selective solubility of the fullerene component is demonstrated using these high boiling point processing additives. The best results are obtained with R = Iodine (I). Using 1,8-diiodooctane as the processing additive, the efficiency of the BHJ solar cells was improved from 3.4% (for the reference device) to 5.1%."

The morphology and mechanical properties of the film were studied by SEM and texture analyser. Results showed that lycopene and TiO2 nanoparticles were distributed in the film matrix uniformly, TiO2 and lycopene increased the mechanical properties of PLA film. The PLA/TiO2/Lyc film was used to package margarine. The effect of PLA/TiO2/Lyc film, time and temperature of storage on the qualitative features of margarine were studied. Also the colour properties of PLA/TiO2/Lyc film were studied during storage period. Oxidative features (antioxidant activity, acidity number, peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid value) of margarine showed that the quality features of margarine decreased during storage, but the PLA/TiO2/Lyc film controled the oxidative factors and increased the margarine shelf life significantly (P < .05). Results also showed that the PLA/TiO2/Lyc film colour changed from red to light yellow during storage. With increasing margarine storage time, the film colour index a decreased (red colour diminished) while b increased (yellow colour increased). There were good relations between colour changes of film and oxidative parameters of margarine and storage time and storage temperature. Thus PLA/TiO2/Lyc film can be used as a visual indicator of the oxidation variations during storage of packaged margarine. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT"
237,,2017.0,"The correlation between insulin-like growth factor with glycemic control, glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, hematological changes or body mass index in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family is made up of two polypeptides, IGF-I and IGF-II, six specific binding proteins (IGFBPs 1-6) and specific receptors. IGF-I is involved in the regulation of growth and cellular proliferation and has a similar structure to insulin. The major IGF transport function is attributed to IGFBP-3. Some studies have highlighted the association between IGF and diabetes. The aims of this study were to analyze the correlation between IGF with glycemic control, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure, hematological changes or body mass index (BMI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Thirty patients with T2DM and thirty non-diabetic control patients were included in this study. Clinical, anthropometric, biochemical parameters and morphology of blood smear were recorded. Blood pressure was determined by mercury sphygmomanometer. The anthropometric measurement included BMI. The biochemical parameters included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), GFR, serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 levels. The IGF-I÷IGFBP-3 ratio was evaluated. The plasma glucose was determined enzymatically, HbA1c was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and GFR was calculated automatically. IGF-I was measured by immunoradiometric assay (ELISA - enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and IGFBP-3 by sensitivity immunoassay. For the analysis of the morphology of blood smear, May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) was used as staining technique. The microscopic examination was performed initially with the objectives of 10×÷20× and subsequently with an immersion objective of 100×. Image acquisition was done after the examination of the preparations obtained with a 40× objective, using Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. In the present study, we observed that T2DM leads to an increase in the IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels. No relationship was obtain between IGF-I, IGFBP-3 levels and IGF-I÷IGFBP-3 ratio with neither parameters studied. The difference of serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels between patients with T2DM and subjects without diabetes showed that IGF-I may be a useful marker for diabetes mellitus and IGFBP-3 for possible complications of this affection."

Recent work in material design has primarily focused on developing near‐infrared nonfullerene acceptors with broadening absorption that pair with commercialized donor polymers; in the meanwhile, the influence of the morphology of the blend film and the energy level alignment on the efficiency of charge separation needs to be synthetically considered. Herein, the selection rule of the donor/acceptor blend is demonstrated by rationally considering the molecular interaction and energy level alignment, and highly efficient OPV devices using both‐fluorinated or both‐nonfluorinated donor/acceptor blends are realized. With the enlarged absorption, ideal morphology, and efficient charge transfer, the devices based on the PBDB‐T‐F/Y1‐4F blend and PBDB‐T‐F/Y6 exhibit champion power conversion efficiencies as high as 14.8% and 15.9%, respectively."

However, controlling the morphology of the donor/acceptor blend remains a significant challenge, making the regulation of film formation kinetics crucial. Here, by designing a new selenium‐containing polymer donor PQSe‐TCl, the pre‐aggregation behavior is modulated and finely tune the resultant morphologies. Compared with its thiophene analogue PBQx‐TCl, PQSe‐TCl exhibits a larger π–π stacking distance and weaker pre‐aggregation performance, leading to a longer film‐formation duration in the fabrication process. Consequently, the PQSe‐TCl:A4T‐16‐based device records an outstanding PCE of 16.9%, which is the highest value for fully nfEA‐based OPVs. This study highlights the importance of regulating the film‐formation kinetics for obtaining high‐efficiency nfEA‐based OPVs."

We show that morphology and interfacial behavior of the multicomponent active layers confined between electrodes are strongly influenced by the preparation conditions. Here, we provide detailed descriptions of the morphologies and interfacial behavior in thin film mixtures of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a typical active layer in a polymer-based PV device, in contact with an anode layer of PEDOT-PSS and either unconfined or confined by an Al cathode during thermal treatment. Small angle neutron scattering and electron microscopy show that a nanoscopic, bicontinuous morphology develops within seconds of annealing at 150 °C and coarsens slightly with further annealing. P3HT and PCBM are shown to be highly miscible, to exhibit a rapid, unusual interdiffusion, and to display a preferential segregation of one component to the electrode interfaces. The ultimate morphology is related to device efficiency."

One of the major problems is the fact that a great part of the endodontic anatomy remains uninstrumented after conventional treatment and even the accessible parts of the root canals are covered in smear layer, which results as a by-product of the instrumentation and acts as a barrier for irrigants, medication and even influencing the quality of the endodontic filling. Therefore, strategies in advanced disinfection in endodontics are developed and tested in order to meet these challenges. The present study aims to assess the possibility of improving the debridement of the root canals by using erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser radiation. We used extracted teeth, which were subjected to the conventional treatment protocol and then divided into three study groups: the negative control group and two other groups, which were exposed to laser radiation using two energy levels. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the efficiency of the laser aided treatment versus the conventional methods of cleaning and disinfection of root canals."

To simplify this process, self‐doping perylene diimide (PDI)‐based ionene polymers are synthesized, in which the semiconductor PDI components are embedded together with electrolyte dopants in the polymer backbone. Functionality contained within the PDI monomers suppresses their aggregation, affording self‐doping interlayers with controllable thickness when processed from solution into organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). Optimal results for interfacial self‐doping lead to increased power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the fullerene‐based OPVs, from 2.62% to 10.64%, and of the nonfullerene‐based OPVs, from 3.34% to 10.59%. These PDI–ionene interlayers enable chemical and morphological control of interfacial doping and conductivity, demonstrating that the conductive channels are crucial for charge transport in doped organic semiconductor films. Using these novel interlayers with efficient doping and high conductivity, both fullerene‐ and nonfullerene‐based OPVs are achieved with PCEs exceeding 9% over interlayer thicknesses ranging from ≈3 to 40 nm."

244,10.1039/c7cs00490g,2018.0,Organic semiconductor crystals.,"Organic semiconductors have attracted a lot of attention since the discovery of highly doped conductive polymers, due to the potential application in field-effect transistors (OFETs), light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Single crystals of organic semiconductors are particularly intriguing because they are free of grain boundaries and have long-range periodic order as well as minimal traps and defects. Hence, organic semiconductor crystals provide a powerful tool for revealing the intrinsic properties, examining the structure-property relationships, demonstrating the important factors for high performance devices and uncovering fundamental physics in organic semiconductors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular packing, morphology and charge transport features of organic semiconductor crystals, the control of crystallization for achieving high quality crystals and the device physics in the three main applications. We hope that this comprehensive summary can give a clear picture of the state-of-art status and guide future work in this area."

Two effective vaccines are available: inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). Since 1964, OPV has been used instead of IPV in most countries due to several economic and biological advantages. However, in rare cases, the live-attenuated Sabin strains of OPV revert to neurovirulence and cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in vaccinees or lead to emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus strains. Attenuating mutations and recombination events have been associated with the reversion of vaccine strains to neurovirulence. The substitution of OPV with an improved new-generation IPV and the availability of new specific drugs against polioviruses are considered as future strategies for outbreak control and the eradication of paralytic poliomyelitis worldwide."

We investigate this line of research in the context of Indian languages, focusing on two important morphological sub-tasks: root word extraction and tagging morphosyntactic descriptions (MSD), viz., gender, number, and person (GNP). We experiment with six Indian languages from two language families (Dravidian and Indo-Aryan) to train a multilingual morphology analyzers for the first time for Indian languages. We demonstrate the usability of multilingual models for few-shot cross-lingual transfer through an average 7% increase in GNP tagging in a cross-lingual setting as compared to a monolingual setting through controlled experiments. We provide an overview of the state of the datasets available related to our tasks and point-out a few modeling limitations due to datasets. Lastly, we analyze the cross-lingual transfer of morphological tags for verbs and nouns, which provides a proxy for the quality of representations of word markings learned by the model."

An inspiration comes from stereotypical movement patterns in octopus arms, which are observed in a variety of manipulation tasks, such as reaching or fetching. To help uncover the mechanisms underlying these observed morphologies, we outline an optimal control-based framework. A single octopus arm is modeled as a Hamiltonian control system, where the continuum mechanics of the arm is modeled after the Cosserat rod theory, and internal, distributed muscle forces and couples are considered as controls. First order necessary optimality conditions are derived for an optimal control problem formulated for this infinite dimensional system. Solutions to this problem are obtained numerically by an iterative forward-backward algorithm. The state and adjoint equations are solved in a dynamic simulation environment, setting the stage for studying a broader class of optimal control problems. Trajectories that minimize control effort are demonstrated and qualitatively compared with experimentally observed behaviors."
249,10.1002/jmor.11031,2012.0,Musculoskeletal morphology and regionalization within the dorsal and anal fins of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus),"Ray‐finned fishes actively control the shape and orientation of their fins to either generate or resist hydrodynamic forces. Because of the emergent mechanical properties of their segmented, bilaminar fin rays (lepidotrichia), and actuation by multiple muscles, fish can control the rigidity and curvature of individual rays independently, thereby varying the resultant forces across the fin surfaces. Expecting that differences in fin‐ray morphology should reflect variation in their mechanical properties, we measured several musculoskeletal features of individual spines and rays of the dorsal and anal fins of bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, and assessed their mobility and flexibility. We separated the fin‐rays into four groups based on the fin (dorsal or anal) or fin‐ray type (spine or ray) and measured the length of the spines/rays and the mass of the three median fin‐ray muscles: the inclinators, erectors and depressors. Within the two ray groups, we measured the portion of the rays that were segmented vs. unsegmented and branched vs. unbranched. For the majority of variables tested, we found that variations between fin‐rays within each group were significantly related to position within the fin and these patterns were conserved between the dorsal and anal rays. Based on positional variations in fin‐ray and muscle parameters, we suggest that anterior and posterior regions of each fin perform different functions when interacting with the surrounding fluid. Specifically, we suggest that the stiffer anterior rays of the soft dorsal and anal fins maintain stability and keep the flow across the fins steady. The posterior rays, which are more flexible with a greater range of motion, fine‐tune their stiffness and orientation, directing the resultant flow to generate lateral and some thrust forces, thus acting as an accessory caudal fin.

Homogeneously distributed grains of ∼40–50 nm are observed for the ZnPc:C60 blend layer deposited on bare indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrates. In contrast, the blend layer form grains of smaller lateral extensions (∼20–30 nm) on 3, 4-polyethylenedioxythiophene: polystyrenesulfonate modified ITO substrates. OPV fabricated on the former substrates show PCE of up to 3.9% that is about twice the PCE (1.9%) obtained for the devices on the latter substrates. This effect can be explained by better transport properties and reduced charge recombination of the blend layer on the bare ITO."

Among the three types of wild poliovirus, type 2 was declared eradicated in 2015 (1,2). The use of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV; types 1, 2, and 3 Sabin strains) ceased in April 2016 via a 1-month-long, global synchronized switch to bivalent OPV (bOPV; types 1 and 3 Sabin strains) in immunization activities (1-4). Monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2; type 2 Sabin strain) is available for cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak response immunization (1-5). The number and geographic breadth of post-switch cVDPV2 outbreaks have exceeded forecasts that trended toward zero outbreaks 4 years after the switch and assumed rapid and effective control of any that occurred (4). New cVDPV2 outbreaks have been seeded by mOPV2 use, by both suboptimal mOPV2 coverage within response zones and recently mOPV2-vaccinated children or contacts traveling outside of response zones, where children born after the global switch are fully susceptible to poliovirus type 2 transmission (2-4). In addition, new emergences can develop by inadvertent exposure to Sabin OPV2-containing vaccine (i.e., residual response mOPV2 or tOPV) (4). This report updates the January 2018-June 2019 report with information on global cVDPV outbreaks during July 2019-February 2020 (as of March 25, 2020)† (2). Among 33 cVDPV outbreaks reported during July 2019-February 2020, 31 (94%) were cVDPV2; 18 (58%) of these followed new emergences. In mid-2020, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) plans to introduce a genetically stabilized, novel OPV type 2 (nOPV2) that has a lower risk for generating VDPV2 than does Sabin mOPV2; if nOPV2 is successful in limiting new VDPV2 emergences, GPEI foresees the replacement of Sabin mOPV2 with nOPV2 for cVDPV2 outbreak responses during 2021 (2,4,6)."

A key component of this goal is to minimize the risk of reintroduction by destruction of polioviruses except in an absolute minimum number of facilities that serve essential functions and implement effective containment. Effective containment begins with a complete facility risk assessment. This article focuses on characterizing the risks of exposure to polioviruses from the essential vaccine production, quality control, and international reference and research facilities that remain. We consider the potential exposure pathways that might lead to a poliovirus reintroduction, including para‐occupational exposures and releases to the environment, and review the literature to provide available estimates and a qualitative assessment of containment risks. Minimizing the risk of poliovirus transmission from a poliovirus facility to increasingly susceptible communities is a crucial and ongoing effort requiring understanding and actively managing the potential exposure pathways."
253,10.1021/acsaem.1c03994,2022.0,Significant Stability Improvement of Fullerene Organic Photovoltaics via ZnO Film Modification through the Intermittent Spray Pyrolysis Technique,"Morphological control of the layers within the bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ-OPVs) is a key feature that governs their performance. In the present work, we demonstrate that zinc oxide—ZnO—interlayers sprayed via the intermittent spray pyrolysis technique, employing a low-concentration precursor solution, can yield inverted BHJ-OPVs as efficient as the standard reported ones using the conventional laboratory-scale spin-coating technique. However, we record a pioneer stability behavior of the fabricated inverted fullerene organic photovoltaics (iF-OPVs) with various sprayed ZnO conditions. Thus, after optimizing the sprayed ZnO interfacial layer morphology for the inverted PTB7-Th:PC70BM devices, by carefully inspecting the interdependence between the sprayed ZnO thin film morphology and the figures of merit of the optimized iF-OPVs, we conducted a distinct analysis on the optical and electronic properties of the fresh and degraded devices using external quantum efficiency measurements and impedance spectroscopy. Hence, we showed that the most proper ZnO microstructural morphology was obtained by spraying 25 running cycles (25R). Remarkably, we observed that 25R-ZnO-based iF-OPV devices showed a stunning stability behavior and maintained 85% of their initial power conversion efficiency even after 16.7 months without encapsulation in a dry nitrogen glovebox, demonstrating an excellent shelf stability. Accordingly, this approach might facilitate the scalability of inverted OPVs for industrial production visibility."
254,10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00293,2017.0,Design of Donor Polymers with Strong Temperature-Dependent Aggregation Property for Efficient Organic Photovoltaics.,"Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted intensive research attention over the past two decades owing to their unique advantages including mechanical flexibility, light weight, large area, and low-cost fabrications. To date, OSC devices have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 12%. Much of the progress was enabled by the development of high-performance donor polymers with favorable morphological, electronic, and optical properties. A key problem in morphology control of OSCs is the trade-off between achieving small domain size and high polymer crystallinity, which is especially important for the realization of efficient thick-film devices with high fill factors. For example, the thickness of OSC blends containing state-of-the-art PTB7 family donor polymers are restricted to ∼100 nm due to their relatively low hole mobility and impure polymer domains. To further improve the device performance and promote commercialization of OSCs, there is a strong demand for the design of new donor polymers that can achieve an optimal blend morphology containing highly crystalline yet reasonably small domains. In this Account, we highlight recent progress on a new family of conjugated polymers with strong temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) property. These polymers are mostly disaggregated and can be easily dissolved in solution at high temperatures, yet they can strongly aggregate when the solution is cooled to room temperature. This unique aggregation property allows us to control the disorder-order transition of the polymer during solution processing. By preheating the solution to high temperature (∼100 °C), the polymer chains are mostly disaggregated before spin coating; as the temperature of the solution drops during the spin coating process, the polymer can strongly aggregate and form crystalline domains yet that are not excessivelylarge. The overall blend morphology can be optimized by various processing conditions (e.g., temperature, spin-rates, concentration, etc.). This well-controlled and near-optimal BHJ morphology produced over a dozen cases of efficient OSCs with an active layer nearly 300 nm thick that can still achieve high FFs (70-77%) and efficiencies (10-11.7%). By studying the structure-property relationships of the donor polymers, we show that the second position branched alkyl chains and the fluorination on the polymer backbone are two key structural features that enable the strong TDA property. Our comparative studies also show that the TDA polymer family can be used to match with non-fullerene acceptors yielding OSCs with low voltage losses. The key difference between the empirical matching rules for fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs is that TDA polymers with slightly reduced crystallinity appear to match better with small molecular acceptors and yield higher OSC performances."

However, limited by the development of A blocks, the power conversion efficiency (PCE, ≈5%) of SMOPVs based on molecular D–A dyads still lags conventional BHJ OPVs (over 19%). Herein, by introducing a narrow‐bandgap A–DA’D–A conjugated backbone as the A‐block, combined with the linear D‐block BDT‐3T‐R and flexible alkyl chain linker, two molecular dyads, SM‐1Y (one D‐block and one A‐block) and SM‐2Y (one D‐block and two A‐blocks), are designed and developed. Due to superior absorption spectra and better molecular stacking compared to SY‐1Y, SM‐2Y‐based SMOPV delivers a PCE of 8.13%, which is the highest value in the SMOPV reported thus far. Note that both SM‐1Y and SM‐2Y devices show much better storage and photostability stability as compared to the control BDT‐3T‐C6:Y18‐C3 binary system."
256,10.1002/aenm.201801032,2018.0,Toward Predicting Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells via Machine Learning and Improved Descriptors,"To design efficient materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), it is essential to identify the largest number of parameters that control their properties and build a model using these parameters (known as descriptors) for the prediction of the power conversion efficiency (PCE). By constructing a dataset for 280 small molecule OPV systems, it is found that for all high‐performing devices, frontier molecular orbitals of donor molecules are nearly degenerated and in such cases, orbitals other than just highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are involved in exciton formation, exciton dissociation, and hole transport processes influencing the macroscopic properties of OPVs. Machine learning approaches, including random forest, gradient boosting, deep neural network are used to build models for the prediction of PCE using 13 important microscopic properties of organic materials as descriptors. Quite impressive performance of the gradient boosting model (Pearson's coefficient = 0.79) indicates that it can certainly be applied to high‐throughput virtual screening of promising new donor molecules for high‐efficiency OPVs."
257,10.1002/jmor.21606,2023.0,Cannabinoid receptor type 1 regulates sequential stages of migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cells and derivatives in chicken and frog embryos,"The main cannabinoid receptor CB1R first shows expression during early neurula stage in chicken (Gallus gallus) embryos, and at early tailbud stage in the frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos. This raises the question of whether CB1R regulates similar or distinct processes during the embryonic development of these two species. Here, we examined whether CB1R influences the migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cells and derivatives in both chicken and frog embryos. Early neurula stage chicken embryos were exposed to arachidonyl‐2ʹ‐chloroethylamide (ACEA; a CB1R agonist), N‐(Piperidin‐1‐yl)‐5‐(4‐iodophenyl)‐1‐(2,4‐dichlorophenyl)‐4‐methyl‐1H‐pyrazole‐3‐carboxamide (AM251; a CB1R inverse agonist) or Blebbistatin (nonmuscle Myosin II inhibitor) in ovo and examined during migration of neural crest cells and at condensing cranial ganglia stage. Early tailbud stage frog embryos were bathed in ACEA, AM251 or Blebbistatin, and analyzed at late tailbud stage for changes in craniofacial and eye morphogenesis, and in patterning and morphology of melanophores (neural crest‐derived pigment cells). In chicken embryos exposed to ACEA and Myosin II inhibitor, cranial neural crest cells migrated erratically from the neural tube, and the right, but not the left, ophthalmic nerve of the trigeminal ganglia was affected in ACEA‐ and AM251‐treated embryos. In frog embryos with inactivation or activation of CB1R, or inhibition of Myosin II, the craniofacial and eye regions were smaller and/or less developed, and the melanophores overlying the posterior midbrain were more dense, and stellate in morphology, than the same tissues and cells in control embryos. This data suggests that despite differences in the time of onset of expression, normal activity of CB1R is required for sequential steps in migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cells and derivatives in both chicken and frog embryos. In addition, CB1R may signal through Myosin II to regulate migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cells and derivatives in chicken and frog embryos."

The use of the D3 vitamin in infertility treatment schemes has a potentially positive effect on reproductive health in male individuals. The present study aims to examine the effect of vitamin D3, administered alone or in combination with a preparation containing the extract of Tribulus terrestris on the changes in the histological picture of testicular morphology in rats with experimental gonadopathy. Male rats with modeled reproductive function pathology (Serotonin-induced gonadopathy) were divided into groups receiving correction using cholecalciferol alone or in combination with the reference drug Tribestan (Tr), which contains an extract of Tribulus terrestris. In addition to observational microscopy, morphometric evaluation of spermatogenesis was performed on sections of the testicles stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The statistical analysis was performed using the standard software package “Statistica 6.0” with the utilization of the Student’s t-test and its nonparametric counterpart, the Kruskal-Wallis test for one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Mann-Whitney test. It was found that the seminiferous tubules of rats with Serotonin-induced gonadopathy are significantly reduced in size, and their tunica propria is thickened. Sertoli cells are often destructively altered, and the uniformity of their arrangement is disrupted. A decrease in the weight of the gonads, epididymis, prostate gland, and hypoandrogenization was observed as well as a decline in spermatogenesis indicators. An improvement in the morphological characteristics of the gonads was noted following the administration of vitamin D3 in the presence of pathology. The seminiferous tubules had a normal histological structure. The germ cells were arranged in concentric rows according to their developmental stages, and the Sertoli cells appeared visually unchanged. The population of Leydig cells appeared visually more heterogeneous than in the control animals. However, occasionally seminiferous tubules with focal necrobiosis of germ cells and dystrophy of Sertoli cells, as well as a reduction in rows of germ cells, were observed. Overall, the quantitative indicators of spermatogenesis improved after the administration of vitamin D3 compared to rats with experimental gonadopathy, although they did not reach the levels of the intact control. The administration of a combination of vitamin D3 and Tribestan in the presence of gonadopathy resulted in a greater positive effect compared to their individual use. The microscopic condition of the testicular tissue in rats was fully recovered. The combined use of vitamin D3 with Tribestan normalized the weight of the gonads and their appendages, significantly reduced the manifestations in the histological sections of degeneration and damage in the reproductive cells during the period of growth and differentiation, improved the relative level of androgen status in the organism and had a positive effect on spermatogenesis in the gonads. Thus, we have established that the combined use of Сholecalciferol and Tribestan for correcting experimental gonadopathy was more effective than either of the mentioned components alone."

One big challenge is that the formation of bulk heterojunction morphology is an extremely complicated process and the formed morphology is also a highly delicate balance involving many parameters such as domain size, purity, miscibility, etc. The morphology control becomes much more challenging when the device area is scaled up. In this work, a highly efficient (12.9%) nonfullerene organic solar cell processed using a sequential bilayer deposition method from nonhalogenated solvents, is reported. Using this bilayer processing method, the organic solar cells can be scaled up to a larger area (1 cm2) while maintaining a high performance of 11.4% using doctor‐blade‐coating technique. Moreover, as the acceptor is hidden behind the polymer donor, the possibility of degradation by sunlight is lessened. Thus, improved photostability is observed in the bilayer structure device when compared with the bulk heterojunction device. This method offers a truly compatible processing technique for printing large‐area OSC modules."
260,10.1002/jmor.10956,2011.0,"Functional morphology of the luminescence system of Siphamia versicolor (Perciformes: Apogonidae), a bacterially luminous coral reef fish","Previous studies of the luminescence system of Siphamia versicolor (Perciformes: Apogonidae) identified a ventral light organ, reflector, lens, duct, and a ventral diffuser extending from the throat to the caudal peduncle. The control and function of luminescence in this and other species of Siphamia, however, have not been defined. Morphological examination of fresh and preserved specimens identified additional components of the luminescence system involved in control and ventral emission of luminescence, including a retractable shutter over the ventral face of the light organ, contiguity of the ventral diffuser from the caudal peduncle to near the chin, and transparency of the bones and other tissues of the lower jaw. The shutter halves retract laterally, allowing the ventral release of light, and relax medially, blocking ventral light emission; topical application of norepinephrine to the exposed light organ resulted in retraction of the shutter halves, which suggests that operation of the shutter is under neuromuscular control. The extension of the diffuser to near the chin and transparency of the lower jaw allow a uniform emission of luminescence over the entire ventrum of the fish. The live aquarium‐held fish were found to readily and consistently display ventral luminescence. At twilight, the fish left the protective association with their longspine sea urchin, Diadema setosum, and began to emit ventral luminescence and to feed on zooplankton. Ventral luminescence illuminated a zone below and around the fish, which typically swam close to the substrate. Shortly after complete darkness, the fish stopped feeding and emitting luminescence. These observations suggest that S. versicolor uses ventral luminescence to attract and feed on zooplankton from the reef benthos at twilight. Ventral luminescence may allow S. versicolor to exploit for feeding the gap at twilight in the presence of potential predators as the reef transitions from diurnally active to nocturnally active organisms.

261,,2016.0,"Influence of hyperforin on the morphology of internal organs and biochemical parameters, in experimental model in mice.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Hyperforin (HY) is used to treat depression and skin irritation and has been shown a number of pharmacological activities. The literature does no cite data on changes that may occur in the body after HY intake (ethylene diammonium salt - EDS) in long-term administration. From this point of view, the present work is a key to determining the pharmacotoxicological profile of the HY-EDS, in long-term administration.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In present research, the influence of toxic doses of HY-EDS was investigated on the biochemical serum parameters and the histopathological changes in internal organs on the experimental mice model. For acute toxicity determination, the HY-EDS was tested in doses of 2000-5000 mg÷kg, administered once per day orally. For subacute toxicity, the HY-EDS was tested in three groups of mice, in doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg÷kg÷day, administered once daily, for 28 consecutive days.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
As concern acute toxicity, a lethal effect has not occurred at any of the two tested doses and HY-EDS was classified as Class V toxic: median lethal dose (LD50) >5000 mg÷kg, p.o. After 14 days of follow-up in acute toxicity, the experimental results showed a statistically significant increase of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), compared to the control group. There were no changes in creatinine and serum glucose compared to the control group. After the administration of repeated doses, it was observed an increase of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Histological examination revealed that the liver injuries were in an initial stage, making them reversible in case of HY-EDS treatment discontinuation. There was no evidence of kidney damage to any of the doses of HY-EDS."
262,,2012.0,The heterogeneity of craniofacial morphology in Prader-Willi patients.,"Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disorder with narrow spectrum of facial phenotypic signs, which make the clinical diagnosis difficult in some cases. There are several reports describing the craniofacial appearance of Prader-Willi patients, but there are only a few cephalometric studies for these patients. In this study were included 18 patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and a control group of 18 subjects of both sexes selected based on specific criteria. The cephalometric radiographs of the patients were taken using the standardized technique with centric teeth in occlusion and lips in relaxed position. Angular, horizontal and linear measurements were analyzed for the study group and for the control group. We established that in Prader-Willi patients, there is a decrease of the majority of parameters but the degree of this reduction varies widely between patients and clinically typical facies not always have smaller measurements which can be found in an unusual facies. Facial dysmorphism in Prader-Willi patients varies a group ranging from miss proportions that do not alter the facial architecture as regard of facial typology, skeletal class and pattern of development to a severe disturbance of those. There is a degree of clinical heterogeneity between subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome on clinical evaluation and cephalometric study confirms the heterogeneity for this patients. Because the identification of smaller dimensions for majority of parameters in children and adults, the possibility of developmental delay or growth retardation delay can be excluded. These findings are important for the orthodontist for optimum timing of orthodontic management of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome."
263,10.15585/mmwr.mm6845a4,2019.0,"Update on Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Outbreaks — Worldwide, January 2018–June 2019","Certification of global eradication of indigenous wild poliovirus type 2 occurred in 2015 and of type 3 in 2019. Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988 and broad use of live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), the number of wild poliovirus cases has declined >99.99% (1). Genetically divergent vaccine-derived poliovirus* (VDPV) strains can emerge during vaccine use and spread in underimmunized populations, becoming circulating VDPV (cVDPV) strains, and resulting in outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis.† In April 2016, all oral polio vaccination switched from trivalent OPV (tOPV; containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV; containing types 1 and 3) (2). Monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2) is used in response campaigns to control type 2 cVDPV (cVDPV2) outbreaks. This report presents data on cVDPV outbreaks detected during January 2018-June 2019 (as of September 30, 2019). Compared with January 2017-June 2018 (3), the number of reported cVDPV outbreaks more than tripled, from nine to 29; 25 (86%) of the outbreaks were caused by cVDPV2. The increase in the number of outbreaks in 2019 resulted from VDPV2 both inside and outside of mOPV2 response areas. GPEI is planning future use of a novel type 2 OPV, stabilized to decrease the likelihood of reversion to neurovirulence. However, all countries must maintain high population immunity to decrease the risk for cVDPV emergence. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for VDPV emergence."
264,10.1021/acsami.4c08868,2024.0,Achieving High Efficiency and Stability in Organic Photovoltaics with a Nanometer-Scale Twin p–i–n Structured Active Layer,"In pursuing high stability and power conversion efficiency for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), a sequential deposition (SD) approach to fabricate active layers with p–i–n structures (where p, i, and n represent the electron donor, mixed donor:acceptor, and electron acceptor regions, respectively, distinctively different from the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure) has emerged. Here, we present a novel approach that by incorporating two polymer donors, PBDBT-DTBT and PTQ-2F, and one small-molecule acceptor, BTP-3-EH-4Cl, into the active layer with sequential deposition, we formed a device with nanometer-scale twin p–i–n structured active layer. The twin p–i–n PBDBT-DTBT:PTQ-2F/BTP-3-EH-4Cl device involved first depositing a PBDBT-DTBT:PTQ-2F blend under layer and then a BTP-3-EH-4Cl top layer and exhibited an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 18.6%, as compared to the 16.4% for the control BHJ PBDBT-DTBT:PTQ-2F:BTP-3-EH-4Cl device or 16.6% for the single p–i–n PBDBT-DTBT/BTP-3-EH-4Cl device. The PCE enhancement resulted mainly from the twin p–i–n active layer’s multiple nanoscale charge carrier pathways that contributed to an improved fill factor and faster photocurrent generation based on transient absorption studies. The PBDBT-DTBT:PTQ-2F/BTP-3-EH-4Cl film possessed a vertical twin p–i–n morphology that was revealed through secondary ion mass spectrometry and synchrotron grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering analyses. The thermal stability (T80) at 85 °C of the twin p–i–n PBDBT-DTBT:PTQ-2F/BTP-3-EH-4Cl device surpassed that of the single p–i–n PBDBT-DTBT/BTP-3-EH-4Cl devices (906 vs 196 h). This approach of providing a twin p–i–n structure in the active layer can lead to substantial enhancements in both the PCE and stability of organic photovoltaics, laying a solid foundation for future commercialization of the organic photovoltaics technology."

This mixtures form salt-type gels in a water/ethanol (2:1, v/v) mixture. The gelation properties of these two-component mixtures could be modulated by variation of the position of the ''N'' atom of the end pyridyl groups in OPVs. The presence of acid-base interactions in the self-assembly of these two-component systems leading to gelation was probed in detail by using stoichiometry-dependent UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, temperature-dependent UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy clearly demonstrated a J-type aggregation mode of these gelator molecules during the sol-to-gel transition process. Morphological features and the arrangement of the molecules in the gels were examined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Calculation of the length of each molecular system by energy minimization in its extended conformation and comparison with the XRD patterns revealed that this class of gelator molecules adopts lamellar organizations. Rheological properties of these two-component systems provided clear evidence that the flow behavior could be modulated by varying the acid/amine ratio. Polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and XRD results revealed that the solid-phase behavior of such two-component mixtures (acid/base=2:1) varied significantly upon changing the proton-acceptor part from BP to OPV. Interestingly, the XRD pattern of these acid/base mixtures after annealing at their associated isotropic temperature was significantly different from that of their xerogels."

The innovation of bulk heterojunction (BH) led to significant improvement for exciton harvesting, but carrier recombination at the distributed interfaces and variability of performance have been persistent concerns. The purpose of this paper is to theoretically explore the efficiency-space of OPV as a function of the degree of randomness of its morphology and to optimize the BHJ morphology for the maximum efficiency. We use systematic numerical simulation of exciton/electron/hole transport to predict the efficiency and variability associated with various OPV morphologies. We find that while (1) the efficiency of random BHJ morphology can be close to optimal, (2) the significant variability associated with cells suggests reduced efficiency in a series-connected configuration. (3) We also find that a simple fully ordered structure may also not be optimum; instead a fin like geometry (Fig. 4) may improve efficiency. (4) We also analyze the effect of each transport parameters on the cell efficiency and show that under certain configuration of transport parameters, the long-abandoned PHJ structure may re-emerge as optimal geometry."

This phenomenon occurs in the central nervous system in normal and pathological conditions. Typically, this can manifest age-related changes, and the prevalence of biominerals increases with age. At the same time, it can be a sign of pathology – tumour growth, dystrophy, metabolic disorders, etc. This work aims to study the morphological features of the dura mater with signs of biomineralization. In this work, we examined 30 samples of the dura mater with signs of biomineralization (group I) and 30 samples without these signs (group II) obtained during autopsies in the pathology department of the Sumy Regional Clinical Hospital. For the morphological characteristics of the dura mater, we used histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical methods, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Statistical processing of the results of the immunohistochemical study was carried out in the GraphPad Prism 8.0 statistical package using parametric and non-parametric research methods. To divide the samples into groups, we relied on the histological method – staining with hematoxylin-eosin. Histochemical methods (alizarin red staining, von Koss method) confirmed the presence of calcium compounds in the studied group. Van Gieson staining visualized the collagen fibres of the dura mater, and the PAS reaction did not reveal the presence of glycosaminoglycans in the mineral deposits. Immunohistochemical examination of the dura mater with antibodies against osteopontin revealed a significant difference between the study and control groups (p<0.001), confirming the critical role of osteopontin in the biomineralization process in this tissue. With the help of scanning electron microscopy, it was found that biominerals in the dura mater are represented by tens to hundreds of formations of various shapes (rounded, oval and irregular), varying from tens of nanometers to 50 micrometres. Their composition was analyzed using maps and spectra of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and most probably corresponded to calcium hydroxyapatite. So, the dura mater is characterized by biomineralization, manifested by the formation of microscopic calcium hydroxyapatite composites."

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine with a pleiotropic effect on CRC development. We aimed to evaluate IL-6 expression in tumor cells and in immune cells in TME, to assess the serum level and IL6 -174 G/C genotype distribution and to correlate the results with selected morphologic and clinical parameters that may add useful information in understanding the mechanisms of human CRC progression. A total of 153 patients with CRC were recruited in the current study. We assessed the IL-6 serum concentration through the ELISA method, the expression of IL-6 in tumor and in immune cells by immunohistochemical and double immunofluorescence staining, the MSI status by immunоhistochemistry for 4 mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, and the genotype distributions for IL6 -174G/C (rs1800795) single-nucleotide polymorphism through PCR-RFLP method. Our results showed that serum IL-6 level were increased in CRC patients as compared with healthy controls (P<0.0001), and in patients with cancers with advanced histologic type (type IV). However, the higher concentration (above the median of 55.71 pg/mL) was with borderline association with longer survival of the patients after surgical therapy (P=0.055, Log rank test). We also found that IL-6+ immune cells prevailed in the invasive front (IF) of tumors compared with the tumor stroma (TS) (P<0.0001). More IL-6+ cells were recruited in the tumors with less advanced histologic type (I+II), with stronger inflammatory infiltrate in the IF, in early pTNM stages (I+II), without lymph node and distant metastases and the higher levels of IL-6+ cells, especially in the IF, were associated with longer survival (P=0.012). The results of our study suggest that although the serum levels of IL-6 are higher in CRC, the increased IL-6+ cells in tumor microenvironment, both in the invasive front and in tumor stroma, as well as the higher serum levels are associated with good prognostic variables and longer survival of the patients mainly in the early stages of CRC."

Int. J. Morphol., 40(1) :233-241, 2022. SUMMARY: This study aims to investigate the effect of Tangzhouling on the morphological changes of Nissl bodies in the dorsal root ganglion of DM Rats. In this study, 69 rats were randomly divided into a control group (n = 10) and a model group (n = 59). The rats in the model group were randomly divided into a diabetic group (n = 11), a vitamin C group (n = 12), a low dose Tangzhouling group (n = 12), a medium dose Tangzhouling group (n = 12) and a high dose Tangzhouling group (n = 12). The dose of Tangzhouling in the low dose group was 5 times that of the adult dose, being 0.44g/kg/d. The dose of Tangzhouling in the medium dose group was 10 times that of the adult dose, being 0.88g/kg/d. The dose of Tangzhouling in the high dose group was 20 times that of the adult dose, being 1.75g/kg/d. All doses above are crude drug dosages. Rats in the vitamin C group were given 10 times the dose of an adult, being, 0.05 g/ kg/d. The diabetic group and the control group were given the same amount of distilled water. Drug delivery time is 16 weeks. The dorsal root ganglion was placed in a freezing tube at the end of the experiment. The morphological changes of Nissl bodies in the dorsal root ganglion were detected by HE and Nissl staining. The study results showed that vitamin C had no significant effect on the quantity, size and nucleolus. Tangzhouling can improvee the morphology, quantity and nucleolus of Nissl bodies to a certain extent, and the high dose is better than the lower dose. Tangzhouling capsules can improve the nerve function of DM rats through Nissl bodies."
271,10.47162/RJME.62.4.09,2022.0,"MLH1, BRAF and p53 – searching for significant markers to predict evolution towards adenocarcinoma in colonic sessile serrated lesions","Background and Aim: Colonic serrated lesions are premalignant lesions, using an alternative malignization pathway, including multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, as: mismatch repair deficiency due to MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) promoter methylation, tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations, activating mutations of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS). Our study aims to evaluate MLH1, BRAF and p53 immunohistochemical (IHC) status in sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), with and without dysplasia. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study including 20 SSLs with dysplasia and 20 SSLs without dysplasia (matching sex and age). IHC expression of MLH1, BRAF and p53 was evaluated as the percent of nuclear loss of MLH1, cytoplasmic positivity of BRAF and nuclear positivity of p53. Data concerning age, sex, localization of the lesion, dysplasia and IHC results were statistically processed using Microsoft Excel. Results: We had very polymorphous patterns of IHC expression for BRAF, MLH1 and p53, especially in the dysplastic group. Thus, two patients were BRAF+/MLH1-/p53+, three were BRAF+/MLH1-/p53-, one was BRAF+/MLH1+/p53- and six were BRAF+/MLH1+/p53+. Dysplastic lesions without BRAF mutation exhibited the following phenotype: one case BRAF-/MLH1-/p53+, four BRAF-/MLH1-/p53- and three BRAF-/MLH1+/p53+. In the control group (SSLs without dysplasia), there was a more homogenous distribution of cases: eight cases BRAF+/MLH1+/p53-, seven BRAF-/MLH1+/p53-, one BRAF-/MLH1-/p53+, two BRAF-/MLH1-/p53- and two BRAF-/MLH1+/p53+. Conclusions: There are more routes on the serrated pathway, with different mutations and time of acquisition of each genetic or epigenetic lesion with the same morphological result. These lesions should be stratified according to their risk to poor outcome and their need to further surveillance."

Herein, we synthesize two WB-CPDs, namely, PBQ-H and PBQ-M, with and without methyl groups on the fused-dithieno[3,2-f:2',3'-h]quinoxaline (DTQx) moiety. We systematically investigate their structure-property relationship and OPV performances. The AFM and 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies reveal that the PBQ-H:BO-4Cl BHJ blend shows strengthened aggregation behavior and stronger π-π stacking on face-on orientation compared with the PBQ-M:BO-4Cl BHJ blend, enhancing the phase separation, charge transport, and fill factor (FF). Blend film absorption spectra, however, show that the PBQ-H:BO-4Cl BHJ blend exhibits a lower absorption coefficient than that of the PBQ-M:BO-4Cl BHJ blend, which decreases the short-circuit current density (JSC). As a consequence, the optimized PBQ-H:BO-4Cl BHJ blend delivers a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.88% with a JSC of 23.97 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V, and an FF of 62.46%, compared with the PBQ-M:BO-4Cl BHJ blend (PCE of 11.81% with a JSC of 24.78 mA/cm2, a VOC of 0.85 V, and an FF of 56.11%). Overall, this work demonstrates that alkyl group substitution on the DTQx moiety on the basis of WB-CPDs is critical for controlling the film morphology and thus obtaining high OPV performances."
273,10.1002/adfm.201301820,2014.0,Photovoltaic Function and Exciton/Charge Transfer Dynamics in a Highly Efficient Semiconducting Copolymer,"Exciton dissociation is a key step for the light energy conversion to electricity in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Here, excitonic dissociation pathways in the high‐performance, low bandgap “in‐chain donor–acceptor” polymer PTB7 by transient optical absorption (TA) spectroscopy in solutions, neat films, and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PTB7:PC71BM (phenyl‐C71‐butyric acid methyl ester) films are investigated. The dynamics and energetics of the exciton and intra‐/intermolecular charge separated states are characterized. A distinct, dynamic, spectral red‐shift of the polymer cation is observed in the BHJ films in TA spectra following electron transfer from the polymer to PC71BM, which can be attributed to the time evolution of the hole–electron spatial separation after exciton splitting. Effects of film morphology are also investigated and compared to those of conjugated homopolymers. The enhanced charge separation along the PTB7 alternating donor–acceptor backbone is understood by intramolecular charge separation through polarized, delocalized excitons that lower the exciton binding energy. Consequently, ultrafast charge separation and transport along these polymer backbones reduce carrier recombination in these largely amorphous films. This charge separation mechanism explains why higher degrees of PCBM intercalation within BHJ matrices enhances exciton splitting and charge transport, and thus increase OPV performance. This study proposes new guidelines for OPV materials development."
274,10.18311/jbc/2022/33785,2023.0,Biocontrol potential and molecular characterization of lipopeptides producing Bacillus subtilis against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,"Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive and endospore producing bacterium. Limited studies have shown that lipopeptides produced by B. subtilis can be inhibitory to phytopathogens. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a plant pathogenic fungus which causes various diseases like cotton rot, watery soft rot, stem rot, crown rot and blossom blight in vegetable crops. The objective of the study was to isolate lipopeptides from B. subtilis and study their inhibitory potential against S. sclerotiorum. So, the B. subtilis isolates were extracted from the collected soils of Western Ghats of India. They were initially characterized through morphological parameters followed by PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene and confirmation through BLAST algorithm in NCBI database. The lipopeptides produced by these isolates were tested against S. sclerotiorum. B. subtilis strains were effective against S. sclerotiorum and exhibited 18.33 to 29.5 % inhibition under dual culture bio-assay. The antagonistic activity of lipopeptides extracted from B. subtilis strains showed 21.56 to 88.89 % inhibition of S. sclerotiorum in the lowest to highest concentration of lipopeptide tested and was found to be significantly higher than the control. The present study has shown that B. subtilis strains vary in the production of lipopeptides and some of them could produce lipopeptides that are highly inhibitory to S. sclerotiorum. B. subtilis strain NBAIR BSWG1 showed the highest inhibition for S. sclerotiorum. Lipopeptide based poison food technique and the dual culture bioassay results showed that B. subtilis strain NBAIR BSWG1 has immense potential for use in the biological control of S. sclerotiorum. Further studies are being carried out in formulating the lipopeptides for field application."
275,10.1002/anie.201208514,2013.0,A photoconductive thienothiophene-based covalent organic framework showing charge transfer towards included fullerene.,"Organic bulk heterojunctions combining electron donor and acceptor phases are of great interest for designing organic photovoltaic devices. While impressive advances have been achieved with these systems, so far a deterministic control of their nanoscale morphology has been elusive. It would be a major breakthrough to be able to create model systems with periodic, interpenetrating networks of electron donor and acceptor phases providing maximum control over all structural and electronic features. Herein we report a significant step towards this goal on the basis of the recently discovered class of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) which are created by condensation of molecular building blocks. Specifically, the stacked layers of two-dimensional COFs permit charge migration through the framework, and several semiconducting structures with high carrier mobilities have been described. We have created a COF containing stacked thieno[2,3-b]thiophene-based building blocks serving as electron donors (TT-COF), with high surface area and a 3 nm open pore system. This open framework takes up the wellknown fullerene electron acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), thus forming a novel structurally ordered donor–acceptor network. Spectroscopic results demonstrate light-induced charge transfer from the photoconductive TT-COF donor network to the encapsulated PCBM phase in the pore system. Moreover, we have created the first working COF-based photovoltaic device with the above components. The organization of the molecular building blocks into a crystalline framework with defined conduction paths provides a promising model system for ordered and interpenetrated networks of donors and acceptors at the nanoscale. The most prominent hole-conducting material used in organic solar cells is poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a thiophene-containing polymer with high charge-carrier mobilities. The soluble fullerene derivative PCBM is often used as an electron acceptor in organic photovoltaics. Because of the lack of structural order in the respective bulk heterojunctions it is very difficult to assess the impact of molecular building blocks, bonding motifs, and energy levels on the microscopic processes involving light-induced exciton formation, charge separation, and transport in such systems. Hence ordered charge-transporting networks with a periodicity of several nanometers are of great interest to understand the mechanistic details of the light-induced processes and ultimately to obtain design rules for the creation of efficient and stable organic photovoltaic devices. The new TT-COF was synthesized under solvothermal conditions by co-condensation of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5diyldiboronic acid (TTBA) and the polyol 2,3,6,7,10,11hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP; Figure 1a). Reaction parameters are described in the Supporting Information. As described in the following, the thienothiophene-based COF forms stacks in an AA arrangement, as confirmed by N2 sorption and powder X-ray diffraction. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirms the formation of a highly crystalline COF. Identification of the new structure was conducted by comparison of structures modeled with MS Studio (see Figures S1–S5 in the Supporting Information). Corresponding powder patterns were simulated and compared to the experimentally obtained data. For previous COF structures different stacking types of the hexagonal planar sheets were reported. Hence calculations were carried out simulating an eclipsed AA arrangement and a staggered AB arrangement. The experimental PXRD pattern for TT-COF agrees very well with the simulated pattern for an eclipsed AA arrangement (Figure 1b) with a hexagonal P6m symmetry. Moreover, unit-cell parameters determined from the experimental X-ray patterns match very well with those obtained from the structure simulations (peak broadening included). FT-IR spectroscopy can confirm the presence of the newly formed boronate ester functionality. As previously reported, the attenuation of the OH stretching band resulting from the ester formation is apparent, and furthermore the most characteristic modes of the C-B and C-O functionalities can be assigned to the bands at 1395 cm 1 and 1353 cm 1 (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The B MAS NMR spectrum (see Figure S9 in the Supporting Information) shows a trigonal-planar boron atom with a chemical shift of d= 21 ppm, which can be distinguished from the starting material (TTBA: d= 15 ppm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show the nanoscale morphology of the crystals. A slightly tilted side view shows the long ordered channels with distinct pore sizes (see Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). A top view [*] Dr. M. Dogru, M. Handloser, F. Auras, Dr. T.

276,10.1002/marc.202200533,2022.0,Manipulating Conjugated Polymer Backbone Dynamics through Controlled Thermal Cleavage of Alkyl Sidechains.,"The morphological stability of an organic photovoltaic (OPV) device is greatly affected by the dynamics of donors and acceptors occurring near the device's high operational temperature. These dynamics can be quantified by the glass transition temperature (Tg ) of conjugated polymers. Because flexible side chains possess much faster dynamics, the cleavage of the flexible alkyl side chains will reduce chain dynamics, leading to a higher Tg . In this work, we systematically study the Tg for conjugated polymers with controlled sidechain cleavage. Isothermal annealing of polythiophenes featuring thermally-cleavable side chains at 140 °C, a temperature that is below the melting point of polymers, was found to remove more than 95% of alkyl sidechains in 24 hours, and raise the backbone Tg from 23 to 75 °C. Coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations were used to understand the Tg dependence on side chain cleavage. X-ray scattering indicates the relative degree of crystallization remains constant over the course of isothermal annealing. The effective conjugation length is not influenced by thermal cleavage; however, the density of chromophore is doubled after the complete removal of alkyl side chains. The combined effect of enhancing Tg and conserving crystalline structures during the thermal cleavage process could provide a pathway to improving the stability of optoelectronic properties in future OPV devices.

Further modulation of the optoelectronic properties of OPVs is possible by supramolecular aggregation, primarily driven by hydrogen bonding or π-stacking interactions. In recent years, extensive research work has been accomplished in exploiting the unique combination of the structural and electronic properties of OPVs, most of which has been targeted at the preparation of molecules and materials featuring photoinduced energy transfer. This review intends to offer an overview of the multicomponent arrays and self-assembled materials based on OPV which have been designed to undergo energy transfer by means of a thorough choice of excitation donor-acceptor partners. We present a few selected examples of photoactive dyads and triads containing organic moieties (e.g. fullerene, phenanthroline) as well as coordination compounds (Cu(I) complexes). We then focus more extensively on self-assembled materials containing suitably functionalised OPVs that lead to hydrogen bonded aggregates, helical structures, gels, nanoparticles, vesicles, mesostructured organic-inorganic hybrid films, functionalised nanoparticles and quantum dots. In most cases, these materials exhibit luminescence whose colour and intensity is related to the efficiency and direction of the energy transfer processes."
278,,2014.0,Optimizing Morphology of Bulk Heterojunction Polymer Solar Cells,"Author(s): Gao, Jing | Advisor(s): Yang, Yang | Abstract: The performance of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells is profoundly influenced by the spatial arrangements of microstructure at various length scales in its photo-active layer, referred to as morphology. Due to their complex chemical structures, polymers usually exhibits low crystallinity and carrier mobility, leading to a limited thickness ~100 nm of the active layer for a typical polymer solar cell. Such thin films are incompatible with the prevailing large-area coating techniques, thus increasing the difficulty to realize the high-throughput production of polymer-based photovoltaics in industry. On the other hand, for most high-performance low-band-gap polymers, during their film-casting process, processing solvent additives are usually essential for morphology optimization, which help boost device efficiency. However, most commonly-used solvent additives such as 1, 8-Diiodooctane (DIO), are disturbingly reactive to oxygen or water in air, leading to deteriorated performance of devices made under the ambient environment. Therefore, fabrication processes involving DIO have to be limited to an air-free environment, which is quite unfavorable for large-area fabrication techniques, as majority of them are carried on under the ambient environment. Therefore, an efficient air-stable solvent additive would be greatly appreciated in terms of OPV industrialization. As a result, in order to achieve thick active layers as well as to find an air-stable alternative additive for industrial applications, a thorough and systematic study on morphology is necessitated.First, via rational modification of polymer chemical structure(fine-tuning on side chains), new polymers with enhanced structure order (e.g., crystallite size increases from 35 i?½ to 53 i?½) and higher hole mobility (from ~10-5 to ~10-4 cm2/(V*s)) are obtained, enabling thicker optimum active layers ~200 nm with a larger thickness tolerance up to ~350 nm for the corresponding bulk heterojunction devices. This result is of great potential for relaxing the required level of precision in active layer thickness, which has important industrial implications for large-area film deposition. Second, through examining those solvents with a great potential to satisfy the criteria for efficient additives, a new efficient air-stable solvent additive -1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was successfully found for the Diketopyrrolopyrrole-based narrow bandgap polymer under investigation in this work, with a much larger working operation window (up to 80%) and higher device efficiency than DIO. The reason for improved performance lies in higher hole mobility due to polymer crystallinity enhancement in films cast from solution processed by both additives, as demonstrated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) and Grazing Incident Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) results. Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy were also conducted on polymer structures in solution, and their results revealed a novel working mechanism of DCB for morphology control, which involves the modified solution-stage polymer conformations due to the polymer-additive interaction. Upon incorporating DCB into blend solution, the resultant polymer configurations in solution would have a high tendency to preserve into crystalline regions in the as-cast films and this unique way of tuning thin-film morphology via altering polymer conformations in solution has established a new guide for future additive selection in other polymer systems. Results of this manuscript will resolve the current obstacle for high-throughput process in industry and should be of great potential to contribute to practical OPV applications in the near future."

Because World Health Organization–prequalified BCG-Denmark was not available in India, we conducted 2 randomized trials to test whether BCG-Russia alone or with oral polio vaccine (OPV) has similar effects to BCG-Denmark. Methods: We randomized neonates weighing <2000 g to a control group that was not vaccinated before 28 days of age or to receive either BCG-Russia alone (first trial) or BCG-Russia with OPV (second trial) soon after birth. We performed intention-to-treat analysis using Cox hazards models with age as the underlying time and adjusted for weight, sex and inborn versus outborn status. Results: Administration of BCG-Russia alone had no effect on neonatal mortality (to 28 days of age): 15.6% of 1537 infants died in the BCG-Russia group and 16.1% of 1535 died in the control group; the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80–1.13]. Administration of BCG-Russia with OPV also had no effect on neonatal mortality: 18.0% of 1103 infants died in the BCG-OPV group and 17.6% of 1104 died in the control group; the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.83–1.23). The adjusted hazard ratio for the 2 trials combined was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.85–1.11). Conclusions: BCG-Russia with or without OPV had no effect on neonatal mortality. It is important to determine which strains of BCG have the greatest specific effects (on tuberculosis) and nonspecific effects (on infections other than tuberculosis) in high-mortality regions."

Every year it continues to be a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Extracranial pathology of the carotid arteries is a major underlying reason of stroke. Given the role of alimentary factors in the development of atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries, possible influence of food additives on the carotid sinus structure is of special interest. Monosodium glutamate is one of the most common food additives that is allowed for consumption in many countries due to it being considered relatively safe. Recent scientific research however points towards the possible adverse effects of monosodium glutamate on the living organism. The aim of this study was to analyze qualitative and quantitative parameters of carotid sinus structural organization of white male albino rats under normal conditions, in the setting of oral monosodium glutamate consumption and after its withdrawal. Carotid sinuses of 30 white male albino rats that had been daily consuming 10 mg/kg of monosodium glutamate for 4 or 8 weeks with subsequent withdrawal for 2 weeks were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis at different time-points of the experiment. The data obtained was compared with the results of morphologic and morphometric study of carotid sinuses of 9 rats of the control group. For morphometric analysis, the following parameters were considered: intima thickness, media thickness, adventitia thickness, diameters of the arterioles, venules and capillaries of the carotid sinus vasa vasorum. Summarizing the morphometric analysis results, it is worth noting that, for the duration of 8 weeks of the experiment, steady increase in the thickness of all layers of the vascular wall, but especially intima and adventitia, was observed in the study group. At the same time, the diameter of the arterioles located in the carotid sinus adventitia was decreasing, while venules and capillaries demonstrated invariable increase of their lumen diameter. After 2 weeks of monosodium glutamate withdrawal, the thickness of intima and adventitia continued to increase, while media thickness had somewhat decreased, probably due to fibrosis and dystrophy. The tendency towards narrowing of the arterioles’ lumen and widening of the venules and capillaries persisted for at least 2 weeks despite discontinuation of monosodium glutamate. Therefore, systematic consumption of monosodium glutamate may lead to impairment of carotid sinus structural organization, particularly endothelial proliferation, fibrotic and dystrophic changes of media, adventitia thickening as well as microcirculatory vessels damage, that continue to persist despite the food additive withdrawal."

SUMMARY: Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) of the small intestine causes serious abdominal pathologies including tissue dysfunction and organ failure. L-carnitine (L-C), a powerful antioxidant, may help lessen the severity of these pathological effects since it plays a key role in energy metabolism. In this work we aimed to study the effects of L-C on the isolated ileal and duodenal contractility and histological changes in intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury. Twenty eight Wistar rats were divided into four groups. The first group is the control group. Second group, I/R group, had rats submitted to 45-minutes of intestinal ischemia and to 45-minutes reperfusion. The third group, I/R+ L-C group, rats were treated with L-C 5 minutes before reperfusion and than submitted to ischemia. The fourth group, included rats that were treated with L-C without ischemia or reperfusion. Intestinal ischemia was conducted by obstructing superior mesentery arteries by silk loop.The ileal and duodenal segments were isolated and suspended in tissue bath. Contractile responses were induced by acetylcholine (Ach) and relaxation was achieved with phenylephrine. At the same time the terminal ileal and duodenal segments were examined for histological changes. Ach-induced contraction responses were higher in the I/R+L-C group, the L-C group, and the control group compared to the I/R group, in both ileal and duodenal segments. On the other hand, the phenylephrine-induced relaxations were higher in the I/R+L-C and L-C groups, especially in duodenal segments. In I/R group intestinal morphology was observed to be severely damaged whereas in I/R+L-C group the damage was noticeably lower possibly due to protective properties of LC. I/R injury caused severe cellular damage response within the muscularis resulting in decreased gastrointestinal motility. Treatment with the L-C has significantly affected the gastrointestinal contractility. Also L-C treatment reduced the damage in intestinal morphology that occurs after IR injury."

Morphometric methods allowing quantitative estimation of changes in a variety of parameters of studied histological objects are often used to evaluate the results of experimental research. The selection of a more limited number of parameters characterized by diagnostically significant evidence of these changes is based on their informative value. The aims of the study were to evaluate the informative value of changes in morpho-densitometric parameters of erythrocytes under hypervitaminosis A and select signs to predict its clinical occurrence. Materials and methods. We used male Wistar rats randomized into two groups of 9 animals each. Hypervitaminosis A was induced by oral daily administration of an oily solution of retinol palmitate. The animals of the control group received an oil base. The morphodensitometric parameters of erythrocytes were measured in blood smears. We compared and evaluated the informativeness of differences in both mean values and t frequency distributions of the parameters in the samples. Results. Erythrocyte morphodensitometric parameters altered with retinol palmitate administration. The values of a number of measured parameters differed significantly from those in the control even before the onset of signs of hypervitaminosis A. We identified a list of informative parameters and selected prognostic criteria for retinol palmitate overdose, namely reduced erythrocyte surface area and increased curvature of the descending torus. A more limited number of diagnostically significant signs were obtained when assessing the informative value of differences in the frequency distributions of morphodensitometric parameters. Conclusion. In morphometric studies, in addition to estimating the informativeness of differences in averaged values, that of differences in their frequency distribution can be used, thus limiting the number of parameters measured under similar experimental conditions. Keywords: hypervitaminosis A, erythrocytes, morphodensitometry, assessment of informativeness"
284,10.31088/cem2022.11.1.62-72,2022.0,Comparative study of morphological changes in the kidney and ureter of a rabbit with various methods of infection,"Introduction. There are two main routes of urinary tract infection: ascending and hematogenous. In the ascending route, the infectious agent penetrates from the external environment through the external openings of the urinary organs. The role of bacterial translocation in the development of the inflammatory process in the urinary organs is still poorly understood. Materials and methods. We conducted an experiment on rabbits (n=45) and studied the structural changes in the kidneys and ureter depending on the pathogenesis of acute pyelonephritis. The animals were randomly divided into 5 groups: 2 experimental and 3 control. In experimental groups I and II , we modeled obstructive pyelonephritis by ligation of the ureter. In control groups III and IV, an infectious agent was administered similarly to that in the experimental groups, but without creating a model of obstructive pyelonephritis. In control group V, a laparotomy was performed without ligation of the ureter and without injection of bacteria. The morphological study was carried out with optical microscopy. Results. In group I, on day 3, the inflammatory infiltration was detected in 80% of cases and on day 5, in 100%. In group II , on days 3 and 5, the inflammatory process in the ureteral tissue developed in all cases. There were no morphological changes in the kidneys and ureter in groups III and V. In group IV, on days 3 and 5, the frequency of inflammatory infiltration was 80%. Conclusion. The nature of morphological changes in the kidneys and ureter in acute pyelonephritis depends on both the ways of infection and the timing of ureteral obstruction. In enterorenal translocation, the severity of morphological changes occurs later. Keywords: urinary tract obstruction, acute pyelonephritis, intestinal translocation, ascending infection"

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 48 white rats. Three experimental groups were exposed to light for 21 days. The LL (0:24) model was studied in the first group, while the LD 18:6 and 12:10 models were studied in the second and third groups, respectively. The control group was kept in natural conditions all through the experiment. 
The animals were placed under anesthesia with a combination of Telazol (ZoetisInc, USA) and Xylanit (Nita-farm, Russia). Afterward, their right kidney was removed. The samples obtained were prepared according to the standard method. Statistical processing was performed using the package of applied statistical programs ""STATISTICA 10"" (StatSoft , USA). 
RESULTS: Morphological disorders of the renal tissue were observed in the three experimental groups. In the first experimental group, there was a significant segmentation of the glomeruli, accompanied by dystrophic changes in the renal tubules. In the second experimental group, glomerular segmentation was more pronounced. In the renal tissue of animals of the third experimental group, the disorders were highly observable, and the sclerotized segment is noted. Changes in morphometric indicators were significant across all experimental groups. 
CONCLUSION: Desynchronosis harms the renal tissue by causing changes in its morphology. The most significant disorders characterized by sclerosis were observed in the kidneys of animals in the third experimental group."
286,10.1021/acsami.6b03453,2016.0,Toward Efficient Thick Active PTB7 Photovoltaic Layers Using Diphenyl Ether as a Solvent Additive.,"The development of thick organic photovoltaics (OPV) could increase absorption in the active layer and ease manufacturing constraints in large-scale solar panel production. However, the efficiencies of most low-bandgap OPVs decrease substantially when the active layers exceed ∼100 nm in thickness (because of low crystallinity and a short exciton diffusion length). Herein, we report the use of solvent additive diphenyl ether (DPE) that facilitates the fabrication of thick (180 nm) active layers and triples the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of conventional thienothiophene-co-benzodithiophene polymer (PTB7)-based OPVs from 1.75 to 6.19%. These results demonstrate a PCE 20% higher than those of conventional (PTB7)-based OPV devices using 1,8-diiodooctane. Morphology studies reveal that DPE promotes the formation of nanofibrillar networks and ordered packing of PTB7 in the active layer that facilitate charge transport over longer distances. We further demonstrate that DPE improves the fill factor and photocurrent collection by enhancing the overall optical absorption, reducing the series resistance, and suppressing bimolecular recombination."

The results show that the characteristic properties of the organic layer, such as morphology and thickness, the regioregularity of the conjugated polymer, and the two interfaces between the electrodes and the blend layer have a large influence on the FF by affecting the series resistance (R(s)) and the shunt resistance (R(sh)). The systematic investigation described in this contribution provides a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between the device variables and R(s) and R(sh) and a way to control FF, which is critically important to achieving a high-performance OPVC."
288,10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00157,2020.0,Narrowing the Band Gap: The Key to High-Performance Organic Photovoltaics.,"ConspectusOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention in the last two decades to overcome the terawatt energy challenge and serious environmental problems. During their early development, only wide-band-gap organic semiconductors were synthesized and employed as the active layer, mainly utilizing photons in the UV-visible region and yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) lower than 5%. Afterward, considerable efforts were made to narrow the polymer donor band gap in order to utilize the infrared photons, which led to the enhancement of the PCE from 5% to 12% in about a decade. Since 2017, the study of narrow-band-gap non-fullerene acceptors helped usher in a new era in OPV research and boosted the achievable the PCE to 17% in only 3 years. In essence, the history of OPV development in the last 15 years can be summarized as an attempt to narrow the band gap of organic semiconductors and better position the energy levels. There are multiple benefits of a narrower band gap: (1) considerable infrared photons can be utilized, and as a result, the short-circuit current density can increase significantly; (2) the energy offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels or highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels between the donor and acceptor can be reduced, which will reduce the open-circuit voltage loss by minimizing the loss caused by the donor/acceptor charge transfer state; (3) because of the unique molecular orbitals of organic semiconductors, the red-shifted absorption will induce high transmittance in the visible region, which is ideal for the rear subcells in tandem-junction OPVs and transparent OPVs.In this Account, we first summarize our work beginning in 2008 on the design and synthesis of narrow-band-gap polymer donors/non-fullerene acceptors. Several strategies for constructing these materials, including enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer effect and steric hindrance/energy level engineering are discussed. In this part, in addition to systematic analyses of the design of narrow-band-gap polymer donors based on BDT/TT or BDT/DPP, donors/acceptors based on the new donor moieties DTP or BZPT are discussed as well. Especially, we highlight our work on the first report on the narrow-band-gap acceptor Y1 (based on the new donor moiety BZPT), which pioneered the future development and usage of acceptors belonging to the Y1 family (or series). Subsequently, we analyze several reported certified world record single-junction or tandem-junction OPVs that use these narrow-band-gap donors or acceptors. We share our experiences and insights from a device perspective in terms of donor/acceptor selection, energy level alignment management, film morphology control, current matching of subcells, interconnecting layer construction, interface engineering, and device geometry selection. In this part, the construction of high-performance ternary-blend OPVs and transparent OPVs based on these narrow-band-gap donors/acceptors is also discussed. Finally, in order to push the field into the 20-25% high-efficiency era in the next few years, some suggestions to further develop narrow-band-gap donors/acceptors and related device technologies are proposed."

Together they represent the recommended standards for the modern practice IHC, extending into the era of personalized medicine. The current issue of AIMM introduces a new ISIMM-sponsored series of quality control papers, with this series having as its primary focus the performance characteristics of widely used and important primary antibodies. NordiQC, as one of the leading quality-control organizations, conducts regular, external, closely controlled assessments of the performance of antibodies in IHC immunoassays across multiple laboratories. Results from the multiple participating laboratories are reported back to NordiQC and representative slides for each antibody from each laboratory are examined centrally by NordiQC pathologist panels. The results are compared and analyzed generating a wealth of data, not only upon the comparative performance of laboratories, but also upon the performance of specified antibodies across different laboratories. The intent of this new series is to mine this unique data set and make the findings widely available in an objective nonbiased manner. The report on antibodies against Sox 10 in the current issue of AIMM represents the first of the series that will be published approximately quarterly, each describing a different primary antibody."
290,10.31088/cem2024.13.1.5-13,2024.0,Features of lung lesions in HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in patients with varying degrees of immunodeficiency,"Introduction.The development of the COVID-19 pandemic along with the ongoing pandemic of HIV infection has raised the question of how these two diseases interact. This study examines morphological changes that occur in lung tissue during HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in patients with varying levels of immune status. Materials and methods. The study included 6 deceased HIV-infected patients who had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, which was confirmed postmortem by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lung samples obtained during biopsy using polymerase chain reaction. Three patients were with newly diagnosed HIV infection; three patients had a relatively intact immune status (CD4+ more than 200 cells/μl) and no opportunistic infection and received effective antiretroviral therapy. To perform histologic examination, we used histochemical stains by Van Gieson, Grocott, Ziehl-Neelsen, PAS reaction as well as immunohistochemistry (IHC) with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and cytomegalovirus. Results. The macroscopic picture in all cases was characterized by a decreased airiness and compaction of the lung tissue. Microscopically, patients with newly diagnosed HIV demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with pneumocystis pneumonia and cytomegalovirus infection. Nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 was revealed in hyaline membranes and alveolar cells. In patients with controlled HIV, we detected manifestations of various phases of DAD and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome with a predominant distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in macrophages and blood vessels. Conclusion. Lung damage in severe HIV-associated immunodeficiency was determined by the combination of direct cytopathic effect of coronavirus and opportunistic pathogens. In controlled HIV and relatively intact immune status, immune mediated action of SARS-CoV-2 could take place manifesting in diffuse alveolar damage and making the morphological picture comparable to that in HIV-negative patients."
291,10.17816/morph.625835,2024.0,Morphofunctional characteristics of the vessels of the small circle of blood circulation in those who died from severe and extremely severe forms of new coronavirus infection,"BACKGROUND: An important feature of COVID-19 is the development of pronounced hypercoagulation with an increased risk of thrombotic damage to the pulmonary vascular bed, mainly the pulmonary arteries. Thrombosis of the pulmonary blood vessels causes a local violation of hemodynamics with the development of hyperemia, edema, which leads to a decrease in ventilation of the lung tissue area and serves as one of the causes of respiratory failure. 
AIM: This study aimed to conduct a morphological and morphometric analysis of the vascular bed of lung tissues in deceased with severe and extremely severe forms of new coronavirus infection who were on inpatient treatment in the period 2020-2022. 
METHODS: A pathomorphologic study of 129 autopsy cases with a confirmed diagnosis of a new coronavirus infection COVID-19 was performed. Morphometric analysis and statistical data processing of the pulmonary vascular system in histologic preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain, orcein stain and Martius Scarlet Blue (MSB) stain was performed. The control group consisted of 14 patients who died of cardiovascular disease with bilateral focal confluent pneumonia. 
RESULTS: It was found that the proportion of thrombosed vessels in the lung tissues of the deceased was 27.6%. In 87.2% of cases, thrombosis develops in small arteries (lumen diameter 30-500 microns) and small veins (lumen diameter 40-500 microns). The vascular-functional indices of Kernogan and Vogenworth were statistically significantly increased in small arteries and small veins of the 4th order (p=0.001), small arteries (p=0.001) and small veins of the 5th order (p=0.014) compared with the control group. 
CONCLUSION: Diffuse involvement of small caliber blood vessels in the pathological process reflects the severity of specific hemocoagulopathic disorders in the lung tissue. Such disorders lead to the development of ventilation-perfusion disorders and entail an increase in right ventricular failure."
292,10.31393/morphology-journal-2024-30(3)-07,2024.0,The morphological structure of prostate gland under the condition of experimental prostatopathy and after using of cholecalciferol in the different schemes of hypofertility correction,"The impact of negative factors, stress, and modern living conditions damages men's health and leads to infertility. Prostatitis is often a cause of hypofertility. It is now shown that vitamin D may play a role in regulating the functioning of reproductive system organs. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of cholecalciferol on the histological structure of the prostate gland in rats with experimental prostatitis and after its application alone or in combination with a prostate protector. Experimental prostatitis was induced by cold intraoperative damage to the prostate gland. To correct prostatitis, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) was administered orally at a dose of 4000 IU. The prostate protector (Prostatilen, Pr) and its pharmaceutical composition, as well as vitamin D3, were administered rectally. Rats with modeled prostatitis were divided into groups: EP (cold experimental prostatitis without treatment); EP + seed oil (on the background of experimental prostatitis, animals received a solvent – apricot kernel oil); EP + vit D3 (per os) (on the background of experimental prostatitis, animals received vitamin D3); EP + Pr (rec) (on the background of experimental prostatitis, males were administered Prostatilen per rectum); EP + vit. D3 (per os) + Pr (rec) (on the background of experimental prostatitis, animals received vitamin D3 (per os) and Prostatilen gel (per rectum)); EP + (vit. D3 + Pr) (rec) (on the background of experimental prostatitis, rats were administered Prostatilen gel with vitamin D3 per rectum). Intact animals (Intact group) and sham-operated rats (Control group) were used as controls. Paraffin sections of the prostate gland were stained with hematoxylin, eosin, and Van Gieson's method. In addition to the review microscopy of the ventral lobes of the prostate gland and the isthmus between them, the power of histochemical reactions was measured, the severity of inflammation and fibrosis was assessed, the number of terminal sections of the prostatic glands with a visually unchanged state, with lumen expansion, and with wall destruction was counted, the longitudinal diameter of the acini and the height of the epithelial cells of the prostatic glands were measured. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the standard software package ""Statistica 6.0"" with the use of Student's t-test and nonparametric analog of one-way analysis of variance – Kruskal-Wallis test, as well as Mann-Whitney test. It was found that rats with experimental prostatitis exhibit pronounced changes in the morphological structure of the prostate gland. The prostate-protective effect of vitamin D per os at a dose of 4000 IU was established, which reduced the manifestations of atrophic and destructive processes, signs of tissue inflammation, and coarsening of the prostate gland stroma. Signs of fibrosis development in the prostate gland in males of this group were reduced, and the number of destructive changes and the longitudinal diameter of the terminal sections of the prostatic glands of prostate ventral lobe in rats with experimental prostatitis were decreased. Thus, the addition of cholecalciferol to the basic therapy for infertility has a more pronounced corrective effect on the morphological structure of the prostate than the separate use of cholecalciferol and the prostate protector. Combining basic therapy with vitamin D enhances the prostate-protective properties of the latter and is promising for restoring reproductive function overall."
293,,2012.0,"Macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic morphology of the gastric plexus--ontogeny of the celiac ganglion.","The vagus trunks, anterior and posterior, and their respective branches control the parasympathetic innervation of the stomach. After giving off a few thin branches, at the lower part of the esophagus and the cardiac region of the stomach, the anterior vagal trunk divides into its main branches: four or five consecutive direct branches which supply the upper part of the lesser curvature; these nerves do not form plexuses and thus, they may be individually dissected. One of the branches is stronger than the others and is called the principal anterior nerve of the lesser curvature (anterior nerve of Latarjet). The present study was conducted on eight fetuses of different gestational age (resulting from spontaneous abortions, without malformations), observing the Romanian laws of professional ethics, and 15 adult cadavers (male and female) whose celiac region was dissected macro- and mesoscopically to reveal both the celiac ganglia and their afferent and efferent vessels. For the microscopic study, we used the Bielschowsky silver staining method. The meso- and macroscopic dissections revealed the anterior and posterior vagal trunks in all the specimens (100%), as well as a rich gastric periarterial plexus. The microscopic samples focused on the ontogeny of the celiac ganglion in various gestational stages."
294,10.51347/um27.0003,2023.0,Using urban form to increase the capacity of cities to manage noise and air quality,"The top two environmental factors adversely affecting human health in Europe are air and noise pollution, with road traffic being the largest source. Urban density plays an important role in reducing car traffic. However, the benefits of reduced emissions per capita can still mean higher emissions locally, because of the number of people in the area. Therefore, this paper investigates how morphological parameters influence the local distribution of noise and air pollution. A parametric approach, based on the Spacematrix method, is used to study the impact of morphological parameters on the distribution of air and noise pollution, controlling for traffic mode, flows and speed. To compare the impact of exposure to noise and air pollution, their respective health burden is calculated using disability- adjusted life years (DALYs). The results, based on 31 models of different forms, show that the degree of openness greatly affects performance with opposite effects for noise and air pollution. Building types with slightly open yards, like open corner blocks, may provide an attractive compromise solution due to their relatively good noise exposure situation at the same time as the dispersion of air pollutants improves. Adding sound absorbing vegetation is an effective measure to mitigate noise, especially for blocks with openings, limiting the propagation of sound into the yard. Further, densification is beneficial for health if the increase in density does not increase traffic volume in the same proportion. Densification by adding towers on a perimeter building block gives the best results for health as it combines a less noisy yard, thanks to the enclosure of the yard with towers, which enhances turbulent mixing of air within the street canyon."

The number of people with post-traumatic stress disorder is 27.7 % among military personnel who took part in active combat operations. Post-traumatic syndrome is a frequent predictor of various states of proliferative activity of the endometrium in veteran women of reproductive age with changes in the hormonal background, morphofunctional changes of the endometrium, which in turn negatively affects the reproductive health of women. The purpose of the work: to determine the proliferative activity of the endometrium in patients of reproductive age who took part in hostilities and suffered a concussion. The selection criteria of the women included in the study were: the presence of contusion in the anamnesis, normospermia in the husband, the absence of pregnancy within a year after putting the main disease into remission, and unfulfilled reproductive plans. The age of the examined women ranged from 20 to 40 years. 457 women who took part in combat operations and suffered concussions were examined. The criterion for inclusion in the main group (O) was post-concussive syndrome as a consequence of a concussion sustained during hostilities. The number of examinees was 211 women. The criterion for inclusion in the comparison group (P) (n=246 women) was a concussion during combat operations, but the absence of post-concussion syndrome. The control group (K) included 30 civilian women without episodes of any trauma in the anamnesis. Clinical, instrumental and morphological research methods were used during the research. The most significant differences in the number of immunopositive endometrial cells in the state of proliferation and apoptosis were noted between groups P and O in chronic endometritis and simple atypical hyperplasia of the endometrium. Thus, in the structure of the endometrium of women with reproductive plans who participated in hostilities with episode of contusion in anamnesis, an increase in the proliferation processes in the glands and stroma of the endometrium against the background of intensification of the processes of apoptosis in the stroma and a decrease in the processes of apoptosis in the glands, which may interfere with the normal course of adhesion, was characteristic blastocysts and trophoblast invasions during implantation."
296,10.17816/morph.607423,2023.0,Morphological features of the innervation of the rat adrenal gland adipose tissue,"BACKGROUND: The relevance of studying adipose tissue is due to the lack of knowledge about the etiology and pathogenesis of obesity and the lack of research into the endocrine function of adipose tissue. Questions about the structure, functions, and innervation characteristics of white and brown adipose tissue of the adrenal gland are the least studied. 
AIM: The purpose of this study was to study the structure and innervation of rat adrenal adipose tissue using neuroimmunohistochemical markers. 
METHODS: Using immunohistochemical reactions for PGP 9.5 protein, tyrosine hydroxylase and synaptophysin, performed on paraffin sections, the innervation of the adipose tissue of the rat adrenal gland was studied (n=10). 
RESULTS: Unmyelinated nerve fibers, as well as catecholaminergic and cholinergic nerve terminal apparatuses, were identified in the white and brown adipose tissue of the rat adrenal gland. It has been shown that parasympathetic and sympathetic postganglionic nerve fibers penetrate adipose tissue through arterial vessels. There, Remakov's varicose axons intensively branch and form terminal synaptic networks of the en passant type, which are involved in the innervation of adipocytes in white and brown adipose tissue. Most sympathetic and parasympathetic synaptic structures are localized in brown and mixed adipose tissue. Sympathetic fibers are in close connection with the wall of arterial vessels and contact brown adipocytes. In white adipose tissue, varicose axons are found mainly around arterial vessels and are rarely found between differentiated ring-shaped adipocytes. 
CONCLUSION: The noted differences in the sympathetic innervation of white and brown adipose tissue are due to the fact that, unlike white adipocytes, brown adipose tissue cells perform a secretory function. By producing adipokines, they influence the production of corticosteroids by the adrenal gland. The findings suggest that this process is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system"

In this tutorial review, we discuss the factors responsible for influencing blend microstructure and how these affect device performance. In particular we discuss how various molecular design approaches can affect the thin film morphology of both the donor and acceptor components, as well as their blend microstructure. We further examine the influence of polymer molecular weight and blend composition upon device performance, and discuss how a variety of processing techniques can be used to control the blend microstructure, leading to improvements in solar cell efficiencies."
298,10.1002/smll.202101133,2021.0,Simultaneous Improvement of Efficiency and Stability of Organic Photovoltaic Cells by using a Cross-Linkable Fullerene Derivative.,"Improving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and stability are two main tasks for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. In the past few years, although the PCE of the OPV cells has been considerably improved, the research on device stability is limited. Herein, a cross-linkable material, cross-linked [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (c-PCBSD), is applied as an interfacial modification layer on the surface of zinc oxide and as the third component into the PBDB-TF:Y6-based OPV cells to enhance photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. The PCE of the OPV cells that underwent the two-step modification increased from 15.1 to 16.1%. In particular, such OPV cells exhibited much better stability under both thermal and air conditions because of the decreased number of interfacial defects and stable interfacial and active layer morphologies. The results demonstrated that the introduction of a cross-linkable fullerene derivative into the interfacial and active layers is a feasible method to improve the PCE and stability of OPV cells."
299,10.1002/adfm.201808731,2019.0,Performance Optimization of Parallel‐Like Ternary Organic Solar Cells through Simultaneous Improvement in Charge Generation and Transport,"Ternary organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices with multiple light‐absorbing active materials have emerged as an efficient strategy for realizing further improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) without building complex multijunction structures. However, the third component often acts as recombination centers and, hence, the optimization of ternary blend morphology poses a major challenge to improving the PCE of these devices. In this work, the performance of OPVs is enhanced through the morphological modification of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA)‐containing binary active layers. This modification is achieved by incorporating fullerenes into the layers. The uniformly dispersed fullerenes are sufficiently continuous and successfully mediate the ordering of NFA without charge or energy transfer. Owing to the simultaneous improvement in the charge generation and extraction, the PCE (12.1%) of these parallel‐linked ternary devices is considerably higher than those of the corresponding binary devices (9.95% and 7.78%). Moreover, the additional energy loss of the ternary device is minimized, compared with that of the NFA‐based binary device, due to the judicious control of the effective donor:acceptor composition of the ternary blends."
300,10.1063/1.3672221,2012.0,Can morphology tailoring improve the open circuit voltage of organic solar cells,"While the effect of interfacial morphology on the short circuit current (ISC) of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) is well known, its impact on open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill-factor (FF) are less clear. Since the output power of a solar cell Pout=ISCVOCFF, such understanding is critical for designing high-performance, morphology-engineered OPVs. In this letter, we provide an explicit analytical proof that any effort to radically improve VOC by tailoring bulk heterojunction morphology is futile, because any increase in ISC due to larger interface area is counterbalanced by corresponding increase in recombination current, so that the upper limit of VOCBHJ cannot exceed that of the corresponding planar heterojunction devices, i.e., VOCBHJ≤VOCPHJ.

OPVs typically consist of photoactive layers 20-100 nm thick sandwiched between both transparent oxide and metallic electrical contacts. Ideal OPVs rely on ohmic top and bottom contacts to harvest photogenerated charges without compromising the power conversion efficiency of the OPV. Unfortunately, the electrical contact materials (metals and metal oxides) and the active organic layers in OPVs are often incompatible and may be poorly optimized for harvesting photogenerated charges. Therefore, further optimization of the chemical and physical stabilities of these metal oxide materials with organic materials will be an essential component of the development of OPV technologies. The energetic and kinetic barriers to charge injection/collection must be minimized to maximize OPV power conversion efficiencies. In this Account, we review recent studies of one of the most common transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), indium-tin oxide (ITO), which is the transparent bottom contact in many OPV technologies. These studies of the surface chemistry and surface modification of ITO are also applicable to other TCO materials. Clean, freshly deposited ITO is intrinsically reactive toward H(2)O, CO, CO(2), etc. and is often chemically and electrically heterogeneous in the near-surface region. Conductive-tip atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) studies reveal significant spatial variability in electrical properties. We describe the use of acid activation, small-molecule chemisorption, and electrodeposition of conducting polymer films to tune the surface free energy, the effective work function, and electrochemical reactivity of ITO surfaces. Certain electrodeposited poly(thiophenes) show their own photovoltaic activity or can be used as electronically tunable substrates for other photoactive layers. For certain photoactive donor layers (phthalocyanines), we have used the polarity of the oxide surface to accelerate dewetting and ""nanotexturing"" of the donor layer to enhance OPV performance. These complex surface chemistries will make oxide/organic interfaces one of the key focal points for research in new OPV technologies."

MIR223 is expressed at low levels in progenitor cells, whereas high expression is induced by granulocytic differentiation. Novel-targeted therapies through epigenetic manipulation of MIR223 regulators are being explored in AML but correlative data between established clinical prognostic markers and MIR223 expression in AML is lacking. MIR223 has inverse relationship with LMO2 protein expression and our group has recently reported a close association between LMO2 protein expression and chromosomal findings in AML patients. In this study, we examined the expression of MIR223 in a large cohort of AML patients and correlated it with LMO2 protein expression, cytogenetic data, degree of differentiation [French-American and British (FAB)/World Health Organization classifications], and overall survival. MIR223 expression was upregulated in only a subset of patients (37%). Suppression of MIR223 was more frequent among patients with aneuploid karyotype compared with diploid karyotype (P=0.005). In AML, not otherwise specified category, AML with maturation (FAB-M2) showed higher levels of MIR223 when compared with either AML without maturation (FAB M0/M1) (P=0.001); AML with monoblastic differentiation (FAB M4/M5) (P=0.004) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P=0.011). Among cytogenetic risk groups, suppression of MIR223 was universal (>95%) in high-risk group when compared with intermediate-risk group (P=0.004). No correlation between MIR223 and LMO2 protein expression was identified. In conclusion, we have shown that suppression of MIR223 expression, as compared with controls, is associated with lack of differentiation and adverse cytogenetic profile, but unrelated with LMO2 protein expression or overall survival."
303,10.1002/solr.202100480,2021.0,Effect of Additives and Annealing on the Performance of Nonfullerene‐Based Binary and Ternary Organic Photovoltaics,"Fine tuning of blend morphology is a key factor that limits the performance of the bulk‐heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ‐OPVs). Herein, the morphological control of the binary (PM6:Y7) and ternary (PM6:Y7:PC70BM) blends is conducted through 1‐chloronaphthalene (CN) solvent additive and thermal annealing (TA) treatment with respect to their influence on the photovoltaic performance. Moreover, a distinct study is accomplished on the optical and electronic properties of the treated and nontreated binary and ternary devices by external quantum efficiency measurements and impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that these treatments affect the performance of the binary and ternary OPVs differently. Regarding the 2% CN addition, the current density of the binary devices is improved by ≈27%, whereas the fill factor of the ternary devices shows a pronounced increment of ≈22%. A contradictory behavior is exhibited by TA for the binary and ternary OPVs. The PCEs for binary devices (with/without CN) and 2% CN‐treated ternary ones are improved, while diminishing the PCEs of the ternary ones with 0% CN. Accordingly, the highest efficiencies of the binary and ternary OPVs are obtained due to the dual effect of 2% CN solvent additive along with the TA treatments."

Each lot of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is tested for neurovirulence in animals and also for the presence of neurovirulent revertants. Mutant analysis by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage (MAPREC) is used to measure the frequency of neurovirulent mutations at the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome that correlate with the level of neurovirulence determined by the monkey neurovirulence test. However, MAPREC can only monitor mutations at a few genomic loci and miss mutations at other sites that could adversely affect vaccine quality. Here we propose to use massively parallel sequencing (MPS) for sensitive detection and quantification of all mutations in the entire genome of attenuated viruses. Analysis of vaccine samples and reference preparations demonstrated a perfect agreement with MAPREC results. Quantitative MPS analysis of validated reference preparations tested by MAPREC produced identical results, suggesting that the method could take advantage of the existing reference materials and be used as a replacement for the MAPREC procedure in lot release of OPV. Patterns of mutations present at a low level in vaccine preparations were characteristic of seed viruses used for their manufacture and could be used for identification of individual batches. This approach may represent the ultimate tool for monitoring genetic consistency of live viral vaccines."
305,10.1002/aelm.201600288,2016.0,Luminescent Downshifting by Photo‐Induced Sol‐Gel Hybrid Coatings: Accessing Multifunctionality on Flexible Organic Photovoltaics via Ambient Temperature Material Processing,"A novel high‐durability multifunctional organic–inorganic hybrid coating material is presented in this work as luminescent down‐shifting (LDS) host matrix system for flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Such new LDS coating is obtained by incorporating a convenient fluorescent organic dye in an appropriately functionalized fluoropolymeric resin that can be readily crosslinked by means of a dual‐cure mechanism with a single‐step ambient‐temperature photo‐induced sol–gel process. Due to its peculiar characteristics, the newly proposed system may be readily implemented in heat‐sensitive flexible devices. By carefully tuning the amount of organic fluorophore in the hybrid coating material, a maximum increase in power conversion efficiency exceeding 4% is achieved on devices incorporating the new LDS layer with respect to control systems. This represents the highest efficiency enhancement reported to date on flexible OPVs by means of a polymer‐based LDS layer. In addition, long‐term accelerated weathering tests (>550 h) highlight the excellent stability of LDS‐coated OPV devices, which can retain 80% of their initial performance, as opposed to the dramatic efficiency decay experienced by control uncoated devices. The approach presented here opens the way to the straightforward incorporation of versatile multifunctional light‐managing layers on flexible OPV systems for improved device efficiency and lifetime."
306,10.31274/ETD-180810-58,2014.0,Morphological control in polymer solar cells using low-boiling-point solvent additives,"In the global search for clean, renewable energy sources, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have recently been given much attention. Popular modern-day OPVs are made from solution-processible, carbon-based polymers (e.g. the model poly(3-hexylthiophene) that are intimately blended with fullerene derivatives (e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) to form what is known as the dispersed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ). This BHJ architecture has produced some of the most efficient OPVs to date, with reports closing in on 10% power conversion efficiency. To push efficiencies further into double digits, many groups have identified the BHJ nanomorphology — that is, the phase separations and grain sizes within the polymer: fullerene composite — as a key aspect in need of control and improvement. As a result, many methods, including thermal annealing, slow-drying (solvent) annealing, vapor annealing, and solvent additives, have been developed and studied to promote BHJ self-organization. Processing organic photovoltaic (OPV) blend solutions with high-boiling-point solvent additives has recently been used for morphological control in BHJ OPV cells. Here we show that even low-boiling-point solvents can be effective additives. When P3HT:PCBM OPV cells were processed with a low-boiling-point solvent tetrahydrafuran as an additive in parent solvent o-dichlorobenzene, charge extraction increased leading to fill factors as high as 69.5%, without low work-function cathodes, electrode buffer layers or thermal treatment. This was attributed to PCBM demixing from P3HT domains and better vertical phase separation, as indicated by photoluminescence lifetimes, hole"
307,10.23919/ecc54610.2021.9655205,2021.0,Geometry Aware NMPC Scheme for Morphing Quadrotor Navigation in Restricted Entrances,"Geometry-morphing Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are gaining more attention lately, since, their ability to modify their geometric morphology in-flight increases their versatility while expanding their application range. In this novel research field, most of the works focus on the platform design and on the low-level control for maintaining stability after changing its shape. Nevertheless, another aspect of geometry morphing MAVs is the association of its morphology with respect to the shape and structure of the environment. In this article, we propose a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) structure that modifies the morphology of a quadrotor based on the environment entrances’ geometrical shape. The proposed method considers restricted entrances as a constraint in the NMPC and modifies the arm configuration of the MAV to provide a collision-free path from the initial position to the desired goal while passing through the entrance. Multiple simulation results present the performance and efficiency of the proposed scheme in scenarios where the quadrotor is commanded to pass through narrow entrances."
308,10.1021/jacs.6b05131,2016.0,What Controls the Rate of Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Charge Separation Efficiency in Organic Photovoltaic Blends.,"In solar energy harvesting devices based on molecular semiconductors, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and artificial photosynthetic systems, Frenkel excitons must be dissociated via charge transfer at heterojunctions to yield free charges. What controls the rate and efficiency of charge transfer and charge separation is an important question, as it determines the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these systems. In bulk heterojunctions between polymer donor and fullerene acceptors, which provide a model system to understand the fundamental dynamics of electron transfer in molecular systems, it has been established that the first step of photoinduced electron transfer can be fast, of order 100 fs. But here we report the first study which correlates differences in the electron transfer rate with electronic structure and morphology, achieved with sub-20 fs time resolution pump-probe spectroscopy. We vary both the fullerene substitution and donor/fullerene ratio which allow us to control both aggregate size and the energetic driving force for charge transfer. We observe a range of electron transfer times from polymer to fullerene, from 240 fs to as short as 37 fs. Using ultrafast electro-optical pump-push-photocurrent spectroscopy, we find the yield of free versus bound charges to be weakly dependent on the energetic driving force, but to be very strongly dependent on fullerene aggregate size and packing. Our results point toward the importance of state accessibility and charge delocalization and suggest that energetic offsets between donor and acceptor levels are not an important criterion for efficient charge generation. This provides design rules for next-generation materials to minimize losses related to driving energy and boost PCE."
309,10.1002/jmor.10884,2011.0,"Morphology of the female reproductive system of European pea crabs (Crustacea, Decapoda, Brachyura, Pinnotheridae)","Commensal pea crabs inhabiting bivalves have a high reproductive output due to the extension andfecundity of the ovary. We studied the underlying morphology of the female reproductive system in the Pinnotheridae Pinnotheres pisum, Pinnotheres pectunculi and Nepinnotheres pinnotheres using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Eubrachyura have internal fertilization: the paired vaginas enlarge into storage structures, the spermathecae, which are connected to the ovaries by oviducts. Sperm is stored inside the spermathecae until the oocytes are mature. The oocytes are transported by oviducts into the spermathecae where fertilization takes place. In the investigated pinnotherids, the vagina is of the “concave pattern” (sensu Hartnoll 1968 ): musculature is attached alongside flexible parts of the vagina wall that controls the dimension of its lumen. The genital opening is closed by a muscular mobile operculum. The spermatheca can be divided into two distinct regions by function and morphology. The ventral part includes the connection with vagina and oviduct and is regarded as the zone where fertilization takes place. It is lined with cuticle except where the oviduct enters the spermatheca by the “holocrine transfer tissue.” At ovulation, the oocytes have to pass through this multilayered glandular epithelium performing holocrine secretion. The dorsal part of the spermatheca is considered as the main sperm storage area. It is lined by a highly secretory apocrine glandular epithelium. Thus, two different forms of secretion occur in the spermathecae of pinnotherids. The definite role of secretion in sperm storage and fertilization is not yet resolved, but it is notable that structure and function of spermathecal secretion are more complex in pinnotherids, and probably more efficient, than in other brachyuran crabs.

310,10.1021/jz2002259,2011.0,Selective Interlayers and Contacts in Organic Photovoltaic Cells.,"Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are promising solar electric energy conversion systems with impressive recent optimization of active layers. OPV optimization must now be accompanied by the development of new charge-selective contacts and interlayers. This Perspective considers the role of interface science in energy harvesting using OPVs, looking back at early photoelectrochemical (photogalvanic) energy conversion platforms, which suffered from a lack of charge carrier selectivity. We then examine recent platforms and the fundamental aspects of selective harvesting of holes and electrons at opposite contacts. For blended heterojunction OPVs, contact/interlayer design is especially critical because charge harvesting competes with recombination at these same contacts. New interlayer materials can modify contacts to both control work function and introduce selectivity and chemical compatibility with nonpolar active layers and add thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity to charge harvesting. We briefly discuss the surface and interface science required for the development of new interlayer materials and take a look ahead at the challenges yet to be faced in their optimization."

In this Progress Report we summarize and discuss comprehensively the advances made so far for applications of graphene in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, including that for transparent electrodes, active layers and interfaces layer in OPV. It is concluded that graphene may very likely play a major role in new developments/improvements in OPVs. The future studies for this area are proposed to focus on the following: i) improving the conductivity without comprising the transparency as a transparent electrode material; ii) controlling the sheet sizes, band structure and surface morphology for use as a electron acceptor material, and iii) controlling and improving the functionalization and compatibility with other materials as interface layer material."
312,10.1002/adfm.201303219,2014.0,Alkoxy‐Functionalized Thienyl‐Vinylene Polymers for Field‐Effect Transistors and All‐Polymer Solar Cells,"π‐conjugated polymers based on the electron‐neutral alkoxy‐functionalized thienyl‐vinylene (TVTOEt) building‐block co‐polymerized, with either BDT (benzodithiophene) or T2 (dithiophene) donor blocks, or NDI (naphthalenediimide) as an acceptor block, are synthesized and characterized. The effect of BDT and NDI substituents (alkyl vs alkoxy or linear vs branched) on the polymer performance in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and all‐polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is reported. Co‐monomer selection and backbone functionalization substantially modifies the polymer MO energies, thin film morphology, and charge transport properties, as indicated by electrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, AFM, DFT calculations, and TFT response. When polymer P7 is used as an OPV acceptor with PTB7 as a donor, the corresponding blend yields TFTs with ambipolar mobilities of μe = 5.1 × 10−3 cm2 V–1 s–1 and μh = 3.9 × 10−3 cm2 V–1 s–1 in ambient, among the highest mobilities reported to date for all‐polymer bulk heterojunction TFTs, and all‐polymer solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.70%, the highest reported PCE to date for an NDI‐polymer acceptor system. The stable transport characteristics in ambient and promising solar cell performance make NDI‐type materials promising acceptors for all‐polymer solar cell applications."
313,10.1021/jz502223t,2015.0,The Next Breakthrough for Organic Photovoltaics?,"While the intense focus on energy level tuning in organic photovoltaic materials has afforded large gains in device performance, we argue here that strategies based on microstructural/morphological control are at least as promising in any rational design strategy. In this work, a meta-analysis of ∼150 bulk heterojunction devices fabricated with different materials combinations is performed and reveals strong correlations between power conversion efficiency and morphology-dominated properties (short-circuit current, fill factor) and surprisingly weak correlations between efficiency and energy level positioning (open-circuit voltage, enthalpic offset at the interface, optical gap). While energy level positioning should in principle provide the theoretical maximum efficiency, the optimization landscape that must be navigated to reach this maximum is unforgiving. Thus, research aimed at developing understanding-based strategies for more efficient optimization of an active layer microstructure and morphology are likely to be at least as fruitful."

The GPC-based closed-loop control system can rapidly and precisely stabilize the temperature in the presence of external disturbances. Compared with the conventional open-loop control and the proportional-integral-differential control, the closed-loop GPC system enhances the processing efficiency between every ALD run by substantially reducing settling time with impact by external disturbances. The attenuated temperature fluctuation leads to more uniform thin-film morphologies that fulfill the technical requirements of ALD processes."
315,10.1002/jmor.21366,2021.0,Two heads are not always better than one: Craniofacial and axial bifurcation in cheloniid embryos and hatchlings (Chelonia mydas and Caretta caretta),"Morphological data on craniofacial and axial bifurcation in sea turtles is not well documented in the literature. Here, we use micro‐computed tomography (μ‐CT) imaging to describe the body, skull, and vertebral morphology in axially‐bifurcated cheloniid sea turtle embryos and hatchlings (Chelonia mydas and Caretta caretta) from south Florida beaches. We describe three types of craniofacial and axial bifurcations: bifacial, bicephalic, and bicephalic with biaxial duplication ranging from facial bones to the sacrum. We predicted smaller body dimensions in bifacial and bicephalic embryos and hatchlings compared with their normal counterparts. In addition, we hypothesized that bicephalic individuals would have greater rostral deviation angles than bifacial animals, and that vertebral dimensions would vary between the control and anomalous embryos and hatchlings. Among hatchlings (developmental Stage 31), we found that maximum curved carapace length and curved carapace width were greatest in the control specimens when compared with the anomalous specimens. Overall, we found that rostral deviations were smaller in bifacial animals compared with their bicephalic counterparts. Right and left rostral deviations were symmetrical or nearly symmetrical in all bifacial and bicephalic specimens. Among C. caretta, we found that bicephalic animals had greater standardized vertebral measurements than their bifacial conspecifics. In bifacial animals, bifurcation extended to either the frontal or parietal skull bones, while duplication extended to C5 vertebrae and T8 vertebrae in bicephalic animals. This study provides an in‐depth description of anatomical alterations associated with these abnormalities. Prognosis of these organisms is poor; however, understanding the prevalence of these malformations can allow for better assessments of population health, as numerous environmental factors are known to lead to these changes."
316,10.1021/ar400088c,2013.0,High performance photovoltaic applications using solution-processed small molecules.,"Energy remains a critical issue for the survival and prosperity of humancivilization. Many experts believe that the eventual solution for sustainable energy is the use of direct solar energy as the main energy source. Among the options for renewable energy, photovoltaic technologies that harness solar energy offer a way to harness an unlimited resource and minimum environment impact in contrast with other alternatives such as water, nuclear, and wind energy. Currently, almost all commercial photovoltaic technologies use Si-based technology, which has a number of disadvantages including high cost, lack of flexibility, and the serious environmental impact of the Si industry. Other technologies, such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, can overcome some of these issues. Today, polymer-based OPV (P-OPV) devices have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that exceed 9%. Compared with P-OPV, small molecules based OPV (SM-OPV) offers further advantages, including a defined structure for more reproducible performance, higher mobility and open circuit voltage, and easier synthetic control that leads to more diversified structures. Therefore, while largely undeveloped, SM-OPV is an important emerging technology with performance comparable to P-OPV. In this Account, we summarize our recent results on solution-processed SM-OPV. We believe that solution processing is essential for taking full advantage of OPV technologies. Our work started with the synthesis of oligothiophene derivatives with an acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) structure. Both the backbone conjugation length and electron withdrawing terminal groups play an important role in the light absorption, energy levels and performance of the devices. Among those molecules, devices using a 7-thiophene-unit backbone and a 3-ethylrhodanine (RD) terminal unit produced a 6.1% PCE. With the optimized conjugation length and terminal unit, we borrowed from the results with P-OPV devices to optimize the backbone. Thus we selected BDT (benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene) and DTS (dithienosilole) to replace the central thiophene unit, leading to a PCE of 8.12%. In addition to our molecules, Bazan and co-workers have developed another excellent system using DTS as the core unit that has also achieved a PCE greater than 8%."

Out-of-pla","D uring the past decade, conjugated polymers have emerged as cost-effective functional materials for organic electronic devices such as solar cells 1,2 and field effect transistors (FETs). 3,4 In organic devices, polymer morphology (size and shape of polymer nanostructures or phases) and chain orientation or crystal-linity have been shown to have strong effects on charge-carrier mobility and overall device performance. 5,6 This is because charge transport in conjugated polymer is anisotropic, resulting from electrons delo-calized along the polymer backbone and the overlap of ␲-orbitals. 7 For example, charge mobility of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) along the ␲Ϫ␲ stacking and backbone direction can be higher than 0.1 cm 2 / V · s, while being several orders of magnitude lower along the insulating side chains. 8,9 Consequently, charge transport, mobility, and even optical properties across the active layer of a device can be significantly affected by ordering and crystallinity of P3HT. 8Ϫ11 In addition to chain orientation, control over polymer morphology can be important for device performance as well. For example, in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell structures, control of nanomor-phology of the heterojunction plays a critical role in exciton dissociation and charge transport. 5 In most cases, chain alignment and morphology are interrelated and it is difficult to control both factors simultaneously and favorably. In BHJ solar cells, the hole mobility is just on the order of 10 Ϫ4 cm 2 /V · s, which is attributed to both random chain alignment and overlapping phase morphology. Several techniques have been reported to promote nanoscale phase separation, polymer crystallization, and chain alignment in bulk heterojunction solar cells and FETs. Studies suggest polymer chain alignment and crystallization can be controlled to some extent by spincoating techniques, 19 and nanoimprint lithography 20Ϫ23 have been attempted to control polymer morphology and improve crystallinity/orienta-tion of P3HT. These techniques have achieved some degree of chain ordering, some of them leading to improved device performance. However, a comprehensive understanding of chain alignment in defined nanostructure morphologies remains unknown. Simultaneous control of polymer chain alignment and morphology is still a challenge. Previously, we have demonstrated the use of nanoimprint lithography to define high-density nanopillars/pores in P3HT ABSTRACT Control of polymer morphology and chain orientation is of great importance in organic solar cells and field effect transistors (OFETs).

Improvements in OPV efficiency have attracted great attention in the past decade. Because the functional layers in OPVs can be dissolved in common solvents, they can be manufactured by eco-friendly and scalable printing or coating technologies. In this review article, the focus is on recent efforts to control nanomorphologies of photoactive layer and discussion of various solution-processed charge transport and extraction materials, to maximize the performance of OPV cells.

319,10.1021/ja405493j,2013.0,Predicting morphologies of solution processed polymer:fullerene blends.,"The performance of solution processed polymer:fullerene thin film photovoltaic cells is largely determined by the nanoscopic and mesoscopic morphology of these blends that is formed during the drying of the layer. Although blend morphologies have been studied in detail using a variety of microscopic, spectroscopic, and scattering techniques and a large degree of control has been obtained, the current understanding of the processes involved is limited. Hence, predicting the optimized processing conditions and the corresponding device performance remains a challenge. We present an experimental and modeling study on blends of a small band gap diketopyrrolopyrrole-quinquethiophene alternating copolymer (PDPP5T) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) cast from chloroform solution. The model uses the homogeneous Flory-Huggins free energy of the multicomponent blend and accounts for interfacial interactions between (locally) separated phases, based on physical properties of the polymer, fullerene, and solvent. We show that the spinodal liquid-liquid demixing that occurs during drying is responsible for the observed morphologies. The model predicts an increasing feature size and decreasing fullerene concentration in the polymer matrix with increasing drying time in accordance with experimental observations and device performance. The results represent a first step toward a predictive model for morphology formation."
320,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002599,2012.0,Systematic Review of Mucosal Immunity Induced by Oral and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccines against Virus Shedding following Oral Poliovirus Challenge,"Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) may be used in mass vaccination campaigns during the final stages of polio eradication. It is also likely to be adopted by many countries following the coordinated global cessation of vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) after eradication. The success of IPV in the control of poliomyelitis outbreaks will depend on the degree of nasopharyngeal and intestinal mucosal immunity induced against poliovirus infection. We performed a systematic review of studies published through May 2011 that recorded the prevalence of poliovirus shedding in stool samples or nasopharyngeal secretions collected 5-30 days after a ""challenge"" dose of OPV. Studies were combined in a meta-analysis of the odds of shedding among children vaccinated according to IPV, OPV, and combination schedules. We identified 31 studies of shedding in stool and four in nasopharyngeal samples that met the inclusion criteria. Individuals vaccinated with OPV were protected against infection and shedding of poliovirus in stool samples collected after challenge compared with unvaccinated individuals (summary odds ratio [OR] for shedding 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.24)). In contrast, IPV provided no protection against shedding compared with unvaccinated individuals (summary OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.59-1.11]) or when given in addition to OPV, compared with individuals given OPV alone (summary OR 1.14 [95% CI 0.82-1.58]). There were insufficient studies of nasopharyngeal shedding to draw a conclusion. IPV does not induce sufficient intestinal mucosal immunity to reduce the prevalence of fecal poliovirus shedding after challenge, although there was some evidence that it can reduce the quantity of virus shed. The impact of IPV on poliovirus transmission in countries where fecal-oral spread is common is unknown but is likely to be limited compared with OPV."
321,10.1002/adma.200701519,2008.0,Controlling Morphology in Polymer–Fullerene Mixtures,"In the past several years, polymer–fullerene mixtures have been intensely studied for use in organic solar cells because they can be deposited from solution, are compatible with lowcost roll-to-roll fabrication technology, and have shown high power conversion efficiency (g), up to 4–5%. The best devices consist of a single bulk-heterojunction active layer, in which the polymer (donor) and fullerene (acceptor) are deposited from a common solvent. As the solvent dries the donor and acceptor components separate into domains. The final efficiency of the solar cell has been shown to be extremely sensitive to the size, composition, and crystallinity of the formed domains. Improvement of the morphology in devices fabricated with a mixture of [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been achieved by using heat-treatment techniques and long-time solvent curing, with resulting record efficiencies. More recently, a method for increasing the crystallinity of the P3HT component has been introduced which involves filtering preformed nanofibers of P3HT out of solution and mixing the prepared nanofiber dispersion with PCBM to increase the efficiency of as-cast devices. Interestingly, the best device performance was achieved by mixing lower-molecular-weight (MW) amorphous P3HT back into the solution to reduce the crystalline content of the active layer and, thereby, to increase connection between crystalline domains. Studies of the MW impact on P3HT/PCBM solar cells have indicated that a large polydispersity and number-average molecular weight (Mn) over 19000 g mol -1 leads to improved efficiency. Morphology studies of organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices indicate that the increased MW leads to better network formation between crystalline domains. The morphology of these improved devices has been studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), NMR, and a variety of other optical and electrical techniques. The morphology studies give a picture of a device in which the P3HT forms aligned/crystalline domains, between which are amorphous segments of P3HT and PCBM. These domains form with larger size and crystallinity for higher heat-treatment temperatures and longer solvent soaking times. Depending on the fabrication and measurement techniques, the aligned domains of P3HT are depicted as fibers or as shapeless masses. The majority of these studies do not, however, allow quantification of the percentage of the P3HT that is agglomerated/ crystalline in the final device. Only by making use of the nanofiber filtration technique have the authors been given the ability to control the crystalline content of the P3HT in solution and in the final device. The disadvantages of this technique are the necessity of more complicated preparation, and filtered P3HT is restricted to a fibrous form that requires the addition of amorphous P3HT to provide connections between crystalline domains. We present here a simple method to determine the agglomerated–amorphous ratio of the P3HT and to control the degree of agglomeration/crystallinity of the P3HT in the final device by using a solvent mixing method and no further heat-treatment or prepreparation of the polymer. The most obvious change that heat-treatment and solvent soaking yield on a P3HT:PCBM layers is the change in color. It has been widely reported that the P3HT absorption red-shifts and a series of vibronic peaks become visible at k ∼ 600 nm, 550 nm, and 510 nm. This red-shift has been assigned to increased planarization and stabilization of the P3HT chains that accompanies self-stacking of the polymer. The crystal structure for these self-stacking domains has been solved by using XRD and TEM, and shows a herringbone interconnection of the alkyl chains and an a-dimension stacking distance of 1.6 nm. The p–p chain stacking of the P3HT chains in crystallites has been measured to be 0.38 nm. The herringbone structure and planarization of the P3HT with heating has been confirmed using heteronuclear solid-state NMR measurements. The red-shift in the UV-vis spectrum occurs proportionally to the degree of agglomeration of the P3HT. The pure amorphous electronic spectrum of P3HT or a mixture of P3HT and PCBM is simple to measure. A solution UV-vis spectrum can also be measured in the liquid state. If C O M M U N IC A TI O N"
322,10.1093/infdis/jit601,2014.0,Immunogenicity and Effectiveness of Routine Immunization With 1 or 2 Doses of Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background. The World Health Organization has recommended that all 124 countries currently using only oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) introduce at least 1 dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) before the global withdrawal of serotype 2 OPV in 2016. A 1- or 2-dose schedule, potentially administered intradermally with reduced antigen content, may make this affordable. Methods. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies documenting seroconversion after 1 or 2, full or fractional (1/5) doses of enhanced-potency IPV was performed. Studies reporting the clinical efficacy of IPV were also reviewed. Results. Twenty study arms from 12 published articles were included in the analysis of seroconversion. One full dose of intramuscular IPV seroconverted 33%, 41%, and 47% of infants against serotypes 1, 2, and 3 on average, whereas 2 full doses seroconverted 79%, 80%, and 90%, respectively. Seroconversion increased with age at administration. Limited data from case-control studies indicate clinical efficacy equivalent to the proportion seroconverting. One fractional dose of intradermal IPV gave lower seroconversion (10%–40%), but after 2 doses seroconversion was comparable to that with full-dose IPV. Conclusions. Routine immunization with 2 full or fractional doses of IPV given after 10 weeks of age is likely to protect >80% of recipients against poliomyelitis if poliovirus reemerges after withdrawal of OPV serotypes."

Here, we demonstrate an experimental strategy which has successfully addressed this challenge. We produced a number of samples of the highly efficient PTB7 polymer with various molecular weights (Mn ∼ 40–220k). OPV cells fabricated with this polymer demonstrated significant improvement of the cell efficiency (by ∼90% relative) and lifetime (by ∼300% relative) with the Mn increase. We attribute these effects to the lower density of recombination centers (persistent radical defects revealed by EPR spectroscopy) and better photoactive layer morphology in the samples with higher Mn. Relevance of the observed correlation between the OPV efficiency and stability is discussed."

In this study, several series of inverted OPV were fabricated and thermally aged in the dark in an inert atmosphere. It was demonstrated that all of the devices undergo short circuit current-driven degradation, which is assigned to morphology changes in the active layer. In addition, a previously unreported, open circuit voltage-driven degradation mechanism was observed that is highly material specific and interfacial in origin. This mechanism was specifically observed in devices containing MoO3 and silver as hole transporting layers and electrode materials, respectively. Devices with this combination were among the worst performing devices with respect to thermal ageing. The physical origins of this mechanism were explored by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and atomic force microscopy and an increase in roughness with thermal ageing was observed that may be partially responsible for the ageing mechanism."

In this work, we have varied the group 14 atom (C, Si, Ge) at the center of a bithiophene fused ring to elucidate the impact of a minimal repeat unit structure change on the optical, transport, and morphological properties, which ultimately control device performance. Careful polymerization and polymer purification produced three “one-atom change” donor–acceptor conjugated alternating copolymers with similar molecular weights and dispersities. DFT calculation, absorption spectroscopy, and high-temperature solution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results indicate that poly(dithienosilole-alt-thienopyrrolodione), P(DTS-TPD), and poly(dithienogermole-alt-thienopyrrolodione), P(DTG-TPD) exhibit different rotational conformations when compared to p..."
326,10.1039/C2EE21608F,2012.0,Overcoming efficiency challenges in organic solar cells: rational development of conjugated polymers,"In this perspective article, we discuss the development of organic photovoltaic (OPVs) solar cells. Our focus will be on discussing the development of new donor polymers and device technologies, which resulted in enormous progress in OPV performances with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8–9%. However, for the wide spread usage of OPVs, high module efficiencies (>10%) and lifetimes suitable for commercial applications are required. To achieve such goals, interdisciplinary advances in the development of new light-harvesting materials, the improvement of device structures, and the development of cost effective device processing methods are crucial. In particular, new donor polymers overcoming the drawbacks of current polymer solar cells can play an important role to further improve the PCEs and device stability. This perspective article addresses the polymer design criteria that have been distilled out from the research of the past 20 years: energy level matching, nano-morphology of polymer/acceptor blend films, local dipole moments of the polymer chains, and stability. Also, we introduce representative donor polymers and describe the research progress in the polymers development to move beyond certain milestones. We emphasize the importance of the synergetic research efforts in developing new materials, such as the design of new polymers with improved physical properties, the development of device technologies and a fundamental understanding of OPV mechanisms, which will help to continuously enhance the performance of OPVs."

328,10.1002/pip.3336,2020.0,Organic photovoltaic modules with new world record efficiencies,"During the last years, the development of new active materials has led to constant improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution‐processed organic photovoltaics (OPV) to nowadays record values above 17% on small lab cells. In this work, we show the developments and results of a successful upscaling of such highly efficient OPV systems to the module level on large areas, which yielded two new certified world record efficiencies, namely, 12.6% on a module area of 26 cm2 and 11.7% on a module area of 204 cm2. The decisive developments leading to this achievement include the optimization of the module layout as well as the high‐resolution short‐pulse (nanosecond) laser structuring processes involved in the manufacturing of such modules. By minimizing the inactive areas within the total module area that are used for interconnecting the individual solar cells of the module in series, geometric fill factors of over 95% have been achieved. A production yield of 100% working modules during the manufacturing of these modules and an extremely narrow distribution of the final PCE values underline the excellent process control and reproducibility of the results. The new developments and their implementation into the production process of the record OPV modules are described in detail, along with the challenges that arose during this development. Finally, dark lock‐in thermography (DLIT), electroluminescence (EL), and photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the record module are presented."
329,10.1039/C6TA04344E,2016.0,Geometrically controlled organic small molecule acceptors for efficient fullerene-free organic photovoltaic devices,"Organic small molecule (SM) acceptors containing a perylene diimide (PDI) moiety, F2B-T2PDI and T2PDI are synthesized, and the effects of their molecular geometry on the performance of fullerene-free organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are investigated. The SM acceptors possess a PDI–core–PDI structure in which the PDI wing is connected to conjugated core units. By incorporation of a 2,5-difluorobenzene (F2B) moiety within the core unit, the planarity of the conjugated core is enhanced and the energy levels of the SM acceptor are down-shifted. In terms of molecular geometry, the F2B-containing SM acceptor, F2B-T2PDI, has a rigid core, which can symmetrically align the two PDI wings and enhance molecular packing. As a result, improved electron transport and bulk heterojunction morphology of the active layers are achieved. Furthermore, the incorporation of the F2B moiety effectively down-shifts the HOMO energy level, preventing back-transfer of holes from the acceptor to the cathode and enhancing the absorption of complementary wavelengths of the donor polymer, PTB7-Th. Leveraged by the beneficial geometric and energetic effects from the incorporation of F2B units, the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-free OPV devices using F2B-T2PDI reached 5%, whereas that using T2PDI was 3.63%."
330,10.1002/jmor.21321,2021.0,Ontogeny of the brain of Microglanis garavelloi Shibatta and Benine 2005 (Teleostei: Siluriformes: Pseudopimelodidae),"The gross brain morphology and the peripheral olfactory organ of Microglanis garavelloi are described throughout development, and the relationship of these organs to the general behaviour of the species is discussed. During the development, the main brain subdivisions undergo a series of morphological changes keeping a relatively constant volume increase. However, we observed different growth rates in the brains of males and females when these were compared. During the maturation process, a series of hormonal events result in the development of some secondary sexual traits in the brain of male specimens, like faster growth rate of brain areas linked to motor control, olfactory and visual responses. The number of olfactory‐organ lamellae increases continuously in both males and females, during their maturation period. These results suggest that changes may be caused by cognitive demands that this species is exposed to throughout its lifespan. The gross morphological arrangement of the central nervous system indicates shared patterns with other members of the family Pseudopimelodidae."
331,10.1002/jmor.10236,2004.0,Larynx morphology and sound production in three species of Testudinidae,"Although the ability to vocalize is widespread among tortoises, the mechanisms of sound production in chelonians remain undescribed. In this study, we analyze the morphology and histology of the larynx of three species of Testudinidae (Testudo hermanni, T. graeca, and T. marginata) in order to ascertain the presence of vibrating acoustic structure, and based on our findings we propose a general model for phonation in tortoises. The structure of the larynx of the three tortoises analyzed is simple: three cartilages (the cricoid and two arytenoids) form the skeleton of the larynx, while two pairs of muscles (the dilators and constrictors) control the widening and closing of the glottis. The larynx is supported in the oral cavity by the hyoid cartilage, which in tortoises assumes the same functions of the thyroid cartilage of mammals. Two bands of elastic fibers are inserted in the lateral walls of the larynx just upstream of the glottis, and can be stretched away from the hyoid by the movements of the arytenoids. Their position and structure suggest that these bands are capable of vibrating during exhalation, and therefore may be considered vocal cords. The cricoid of T. marginata and T. graeca hold two diverticula, not previously reported, which might function as a low‐frequency resonating chamber, improving the harmonic structure of tortoise calls. The structure of the larynx is compared with that of other vertebrates and the relationships between morphology and phonation are discussed. This is the first detailed description of anatomical structures possibly devoted to vocalization in chelonians. J. Morphol. 261:175–183, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."
332,10.1021/ar900231q,2010.0,Heterogeneity in polymer solar cells: local morphology and performance in organic photovoltaics studied with scanning probe microscopy.,"The use of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) could reduce production costs for solar cells because these materials are solution processable and can be manufactured by roll-to-roll printing. The nanoscale texture, or film morphology, of the donor/acceptor blends used in most OPVs is a critical variable that can dominate both the performance of new materials being optimized in the lab and efforts to move from laboratory-scale to factory-scale production. Although efficiencies of organic solar cells have improved significantly in recent years, progress in morphology optimization still occurs largely by trial and error, in part because much of our basic understanding of how nanoscale morphology affects the optoelectronic properties of these heterogeneous organic semiconductor films has to be inferred indirectly from macroscopic measurements. In this Account, we review the importance of nanoscale morphology in organic semiconductors and the use of electrical scanning probe microscopy techniques to directly probe the local optoelectronic properties of OPV devices. We have observed local heterogeneity of electronic properties and performance in a wide range of systems, including model polymer-fullerene blends such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), newer polyfluorene copolymer-PCBM blends, and even all polymer donor-acceptor blends. The observed heterogeneity in local photocurrent poses important questions, chiefly what information is contained and what is lost when using average values obtained from conventional measurements on macroscopic devices and bulk samples? We show that in many cases OPVs are best thought of as a collection of nanoscopic photodiodes connected in parallel, each with their own morphological and therefore electronic and optical properties. This local heterogeneity forces us to carefully consider the adequacy of describing OPVs solely by ""average"" properties such as the bulk carrier mobility. Characterizing this local heterogeneity in the morphology of an OPV and the consequent variations in local performance is vital to understanding OPV operation."

Human beings have an environment designed for their physical and morphological capacity, robots must adapt to these conditions. This paper presents a fuzzy-sliding hybrid grasp control for a five-finger robotic hand. As a design principle, the scheme takes into account the minimum force required on the object to prevent the object from slipping. The robotic hand uses force sensors on each finger to determine the grasp state. The control is designed with two control surfaces, one when there is slippage, the other when there is no slippage. For each surface, control rules are defined and unified by means of a fuzzy inference block. The proposed scheme is evaluated in the laboratory for different objects, which include spherical and cylindrical elements. In all cases, an excellent grasp was observed without producing deformations in the fragile objects."
334,10.1002/JMOR.1047,2001.0,Morphology and histochemistry of the hyolingual apparatus in chameleons,"We reexamined the morphological and functional properties of the hyoid, the tongue pad, and hyolingual musculature in chameleons. Dissections and histological sections indicated the presence of five distinctly individualized pairs of intrinsic tongue muscles. An analysis of the histochemical properties of the system revealed only two fiber types in the hyolingual muscles: fast glycolytic and fast oxidative glycolytic fibers. In accordance with this observation, motor‐endplate staining showed that all endplates are of the en‐plaque type. All muscles show relatively short fibers and large numbers of motor endplates, indicating a large potential for fine muscular control. The connective tissue sheet surrounding the entoglossal process contains elastin fibers at its periphery, allowing for elastic recoil of the hyolingual system after prey capture. The connective tissue sheets surrounding the m. accelerator and m. hyoglossus were examined under polarized light. The collagen fibers in the accelerator epimysium are configured in a crossed helical array that will facilitate limited muscle elongation. The microstructure of the tongue pad as revealed by SEM showed decreased adhesive properties, indicating a change in the prey prehension mechanics in chameleons compared to agamid or iguanid lizards. These findings provide the basis for further experimental analysis of the hyolingual system. J. Morphol. 249:154–170, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

With increased shifting from OPV to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), numerous risk management choices motivate the need to understand the tradeoffs and uncertainties and to develop models to help inform decisions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted a meeting of international experts in April 2010 to review the available literature relevant to poliovirus immunity and transmission. This expert review evaluates 66 OPV challenge studies and other evidence to support the development of quantitative models of poliovirus transmission and potential outbreaks. This review focuses on characterization of immunity as a function of exposure history in terms of susceptibility to excretion, duration of excretion, and concentration of excreted virus. We also discuss the evidence of waning of host immunity to poliovirus transmission, the relationship between the concentration of poliovirus excreted and infectiousness, the importance of different transmission routes, and the differences in transmissibility between OPV and WPV. We discuss the limitations of the available evidence for use in polio risk models, and conclude that despite the relatively large number of studies on immunity, very limited data exist to directly support quantification of model inputs related to transmission. Given the limitations in the evidence, we identify the need for expert input to derive quantitative model inputs from the existing data."
336,10.1039/C3EE43460E,2014.0,From lab to fab: how must the polymer solar cell materials design change? – an industrial perspective,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, in particular polymer solar cells, made by solution processed organic materials have shown great promise as a disruptive technology for affordable electricity. Even though recent advances look impressive on paper, until now the commercialization of OPV has been hampered by the difficulty of converting lab produced “champion” cell figures into reliable industrial-scale product performances. A key factor to achieve this condition is to develop OPV materials (polymer donors, acceptors, buffer materials, electrodes materials and encapsulants) exhibiting the required technical and economic characteristics to be conveniently used in an industrial environment. The well established strategies for the design of materials for efficient lab-scale OPV devices are not sufficient when large-area printed panels are concerned. A number of additional requirements, normally not addressed in the laboratory context, must be met: the materials must be easily accessible as pure compounds in few synthetic steps from cheap starting compounds, need to be stable and soluble enough to afford ink formulations processable with roll-to-roll compatible equipment; solvent and solvent additives should be easily removable after printing, and possibly should be environmentally friendly compounds; the layers should achieve a stable morphology under mild conditions (low temperatures and short times); the above mentioned materials can be screened on glass substrates, but should be finally tested on plastic films, protected through a scalable encapsulation technique. The more researchers adhere to these guidelines, the greater the possibility for OPV to demonstrate at last its enormous potential on the industrial scale."
337,10.1002/jmor.21506,2022.0,A morphological analysis of carnivoran ossicles from Rancho La Brea,"The morphology of the mammalian middle ear—including the size, shape, and stiffness of individual ossicles—controls their vibrational response to sound and, is closely related to an animal's auditory capabilities. While the relationship between middle ear morphology and hearing frequency has been explored in living carnivorans, the size and shape of ossicles in fossil carnivorans have been sparsely documented. In this study, we present the first morphological data on four iconic carnivoran taxa from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits: Smilodon fatalis, Panthera atrox, Canis dirus, and Arctodus simus. These data are contextualized with samples of extant felids, canids, and ursids to determine the extent to which the ossicles of these iconic fossil taxa resemble their living relatives. Six, five, and seven linear measurements were taken from the malleus, incus, and stapes, respectively. Comparisons of geometric means reveal that the ossicles of fossil canids and felids are similar in size to living analogs, but those of A. simus are significantly larger than those of any living ursid. Further, principal components analyses demonstrate close morphological affinities between fossil and extant taxa within canids and felids, and again, a greater disparity between fossil and extant ursids. Canids and ursids occupy distinct regions of the morphospace, yet both overlap the morphological range spanned by felids. While some elements—for example, the stapes—require further specimens to facilitate more nuanced interpretations of variation, our findings underscore the need for concerted efforts towards identifying and preserving these bones within fossil assemblages."
338,10.1021/ACSMACROLETT.8B00932,2019.0,Fully Conjugated Donor-Acceptor Block Copolymers for Organic Photovoltaics via Heck-Mizoroki Coupling.,"The development of facile routes to prepare fully conjugated block copolymers (BCPs) from diverse monomers is an important goal for advancing robust bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein we introduce a synthetic strategy for step-growth BCPs employing 1,2-bis(trialkylstannyl)ethene as one monomer, which, in addition to offering improved backbone planarity, directly yields a vinylene-terminated macromonomer suitable for Heck-Mizoroki coupling. The benefits of our strategy, which facilitates the preparation of functionalized macromonomers suitable for BCP synthesis, are demonstrated with a representative BCP based on a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) copolymer coded pBDTTDPP as the donor block and a perylenediimide (PDI) copolymer coded as pPDIV as the acceptor block. Feed ratio optimization affords control over the macromonomer chain-end functionalities and allows for the selective formation of a tri-BCP consisting of pPDIV-b-pBDTTDPP-b-pPDIV, which is employed in a single-component BHJ OPV. Devices achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.51% after thermal stress at 150 °C compared to 0.02% for a control device consisting of a comparable blend of pBDTTDPP and pPDIV. The difference in performance is ascribed to the morphological stability of the BHJ when using the BCP."
339,10.1021/jacs.7b12140,2018.0,Electrochemiluminescence for Electric-Driven Antibacterial Therapeutics.,"The employment of physical light sources in clinical photodynamic therapy (PDT) system endows it with a crucial defect in the treatment of deeper tissue lesions due to the limited penetration depth of light in biological tissues. In this work, we constructed for the first time an electric driven luminous system based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for killing pathogenic bacteria, where ECL is used for the excitation of photosensitizer instead of a physical light source to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). We named this new strategy as ECL-therapeutics. The mechanism for the ECL-therapeutics is dependent on the perfect spectral overlap and energy transfer from the ECL generated by luminol to photosensitizer, cationic oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV), to sensitize the surrounding oxygen molecule into ROS. Furthermore, taking into account the practical application of our ECL-therapeutics, we used flexible hydrogel to replace the liquid system to develop hydrogel antibacterial device. Because the chemical reaction is a slow process in the hydrogel, the luminescence could last for more than 10 min after only electrifying for five seconds. This unique persistent luminescence characteristic with long afterglow life makes them suitable for persistent antibacterial applications. Thus, stretchable and persistent hydrogel devices are designed by integrating stretchable hydrogel, persistent ECL and antibacterial function into hydrogel matrices. This novel strategy avoids the employment of external light source, making it simple, convenient and controllable, which exploits a new field for ECL beyond sensors and also opens up a new model for PDT."
340,10.1073/pnas.1919769117,2020.0,Highly efficient organic photovoltaics with enhanced stability through the formation of doping-induced stable interfaces,"Significance We have developed ultraflexible 3-µm-thick organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with good environmental stability and a high efficiency of over 13% by a simple postannealing process. By combining the stable polymer donor/nonfullerene small molecule acceptor blends and thermally stabilized interfaces due to doping, our OPVs achieve extremely long shelf lifetime with an estimated value of over 11.4 y. A laboratory-scale OPV module is fabricated with a sufficiently high efficiency of 11.4%, total area of 2.04 cm2, and a maximum power per unit weight of 9.90 W/g, showing a promising future for flexible OPVs as power sources for wearable electronics and soft robotics. Flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are promising power sources for wearable electronics. However, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve high efficiency as well as good stability under various stresses. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of highly efficient (efficiency, 13.2%) and stable OPVs based on nonfullerene blends by a single-step postannealing treatment. The device performance decreases dramatically after annealing at 90 °C and is fully recovered after annealing at 150 °C. Glass-encapsulated annealed OPVs show good environmental stability with 4.8% loss in efficiency after 4,736 h and an estimated T80 lifetime (80% of the initial power conversion efficiency) of over 20,750 h in the dark under ambient condition and T80 lifetime of 1,050 h at 85 °C and 30% relative humidity. This environmental stability is enabled by the synergetic effect of the stable morphology of donor/acceptor blends and thermally stabilized interfaces due to doping. Furthermore, the high efficiency and good stability are almost 100% retained in ultraflexible OPVs and minimodules which are mechanically robust and have long-term operation capability and thus are promising for future self-powered and wearable electronics."
341,10.1021/JP993190C,2000.0,Controlling Interchain Interactions in Conjugated Polymers: The Effects of Chain Morphology on Exciton-Exciton Annihilation and Aggregation in MEH-PPV Films,"The presence of interchain species in the photophysics of conjugated polymer films has been the subject of a great deal of controversy. In this paper, we present strong evidence that interchain species do form in conjugated polymer films, and that the degree of interchain interactions can be controlled by varying the solvent and polymer concentration of the solution from which the films are cast. Thus, much of the controversy in the literature can be resolved by noting that the polymer samples in different studies had different side groups or were prepared in different ways and thus have different degrees of interchain interaction. The photoluminescence (PL) of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2‘-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene), MEH−PPV, changes both its spectral shape and quantum yield when the films are prepared from different solutions or when the morphology is varied by annealing. Increasing the amount of interchain interactions enhances the red portion of the film's PL, a result assigned to a combination of ..."
342,10.1056/NEJMoa1303368,2013.0,"Identification and control of a poliomyelitis outbreak in Xinjiang, China.","BACKGROUND
The last case of infection with wild-type poliovirus indigenous to China was reported in 1994, and China was certified as a poliomyelitis-free region in 2000. In 2011, an outbreak of infection with imported wild-type poliovirus occurred in the province of Xinjiang.


METHODS
We conducted an investigation to guide the response to the outbreak, performed sequence analysis of the poliovirus type 1 capsid protein VP1 to determine the source, and carried out serologic and coverage surveys to assess the risk of viral propagation. Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis was intensified to enhance case ascertainment.


RESULTS
Between July 3 and October 9, 2011, investigators identified 21 cases of infection with wild-type poliovirus and 23 clinically compatible cases in southern Xinjiang. Wild-type poliovirus type 1 was isolated from 14 of 673 contacts of patients with acute flaccid paralysis (2.1%) and from 13 of 491 healthy persons who were not in contact with affected persons (2.6%). Sequence analysis implicated an imported wild-type poliovirus that originated in Pakistan as the cause of the outbreak. A public health emergency was declared in Xinjiang after the outbreak was confirmed. Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis was enhanced, with daily reporting from all public and private hospitals. Five rounds of vaccination with live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) were conducted among children and adults, and 43 million doses of OPV were administered. Trivalent OPV was used in three rounds, and monovalent OPV type 1 was used in two rounds. The outbreak was stopped 1.5 months after laboratory confirmation of the index case.


CONCLUSIONS
The 2011 outbreak in China showed that poliomyelitis-free countries remain at risk for outbreaks while the poliovirus circulates anywhere in the world. Global eradication of poliomyelitis will benefit all countries, even those that are currently free of poliomyelitis."
343,10.1109/PVSC.2011.6186060,2011.0,Controlling C60 fullerene nanocolumn morphology for organic photovoltaic applications,"We investigate nanostructuring approaches in inverted organic photovoltaic cells to increase exciton harvesting. Conventional bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) have disordered morphologies which increase exciton dissociation. However, in BHJs free charge carriers can be trapped in pocket domains and dead ends. Using glancing angle deposition (GLAD) we fabricate vertical nanocolumns to increase heterointerface area while improving charge transport. Nanostructured C60 columns have been fabricated using GLAD on transparent indium tin oxide coated glass substrates. GLAD can control intercolumn spacing, column shape, film thickness and other properties. When depositing at constant substrate rotation vertical C60 columns were achieved. Intercolumn spacing was controlled by the deposition angle between substrate and source. To further approach the ideal nanostructure for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), the column diameter was controlled through a substrate motion algorithm called phi-sweep.

Severe burns, especially, result in a systemic immune and inflammatory response, which may reflect in multiple organ insufficiency, and a fast and effective local restorative process is essential for functionality recovering, as well as for interrupting the generalized systemic response. We have aimed here to assess the effect of different wound dressings in what it regards the morphology and clinical restoration after a skin burn. On a rat animal model, we have evaluated the macroscopic and histopathological features of controlled third degree skin burns in control animals versus treatments with local dressings of silver sulfadiazine (SDA) cream, simple gel (G), gel + silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) (G+NPS), gel + exosomes (G+EXO) and gel + AgNPs + exosomes (Gel+NPS+EXO), at 14 days and, respectively, 21 days after the lesion. Tissue fragments were harvested and processed for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence was utilized to evaluate the maturity of underlaying granulation tissue based on double stainings for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31). Our study showed variability in what it regards the vessel density and immunoexpression of SMA between the treatments, and image analysis revealed that most SMA reduction and blood vessel density reduction in the maturing granulation tissue occurred for the G+NPS and G+NPS+EXO treatments. A complete re-epithelization was also observed for the G+NPS+EXO treatment. Overall, our results show that improved topic treatments promote faster re-epithelization and reparation of the dermis after skin burn lesions, providing thus an avenue for new treatments that aim both local recuperation and systemic infection prevention."
345,10.1002/jmor.10321,2005.0,"Functional morphology of the mantle of Nautilus pompilius (Mollusca, Cephalopoda)","This study presents histological and cytological findings on the structural differentiation of the mantle of Nautilus pompilius in order to characterize the cells that are responsible for shell formation. The lateral and front mantle edges split distally into three folds: an outer, middle, and inner fold. Within the upper part of the mantle the mantle edge is divided into two folds only; the inner fold disappears where the hood is attached to the mantle. At the base of the outer fold of the lateral and front mantle edge an endo‐epithelial gland, the mantle edge gland, is localized. The gland cells are distinguished by a distinct rough endoplasmic reticulum and by numerous secretory vesicles. Furthermore, they show a strong accumulation of calcium compounds, indicating that the formation of the shell takes place in this region of the mantle. Numerous synaptic contacts between the gland cells and the axons of the nerve fibers reveal that the secretion in the area of the mantle edge gland is under nervous control. The whole mantle tissue is covered with a columnar epithelium having a microvillar border. The analyses of the outer epithelium show ultrastructural characteristics of a transport active epithelium, indicating that this region of the mantle is involved in the sclerotization of the shell. Ultrastructural findings concerning the epithelium between the outer and middle fold suggest that the periostracum is formed in this area of the mantle, as it is in other conchiferan molluscs. J.

346,10.1002/adfm.201202269,2013.0,Solution‐Processed Nickel Oxide Hole Transport Layers in High Efficiency Polymer Photovoltaic Cells,"The detailed characterization of solution‐derived nickel (II) oxide (NiO) hole‐transporting layer (HTL) films and their application in high efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is reported. The NiO precursor solution is examined in situ to determine the chemical species present. Coordination complexes of monoethanolamine (MEA) with Ni in ethanol thermally decompose to form non‐stoichiometric NiO. Specifically, the [Ni(MEA)2(OAc)]+ ion is found to be the most prevalent species in the precursor solution. The defect‐induced Ni3+ ion, which is present in non‐stoichiometric NiO and signifies the p‐type conduction of NiO, as well as the dipolar nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) species are confirmed using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a polymer/fullerene photoactive layer blend composed of poly‐dithienogermole‐thienopyrrolodione (pDTG‐TPD) and [6,6]‐phenyl‐C71‐butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are fabricated using these solution‐processed NiO films. The resulting devices show an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.8%, which is a 15% improvement over devices utilizing a poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL. The enhancement is due to the optical resonance in the solar cell and the hydrophobicity of NiO, which promotes a more homogeneous donor/acceptor morphology in the active layer at the NiO/BHJ interface. Finally, devices incorporating NiO as a HTL are more stable in air than devices using PEDOT:PSS."
347,10.18435/vamp29387,2022.0,Consilient evidence affirms expansive stabilizing ligaments in the tyrannosaurid foot,"Tyrannosaurid dinosaurs were ecologically unique vertebrates as the sole clade of large terrestrial carnivores (adults >400 kg) in their continent-spanning habitats. Expanded ligaments between metatarsals, inferred by gross morphology of attachment correlates, have been hypothesized to have strengthened their specialized arctometatarsus. We tested the hypothesis of ligament presence with scanning electron microscopy and histological thin sections of putative attachment sites in a third metatarsal of the tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus libratus, compared with a thin section from the unspecialized metatarsals of the early theropod Coelophysis bauri. In the Gorgosaurus metatarsal, Sharpey´s fibers and rough, pitted surface textures consistent with ligament coalescence occur at expansive distal regions and localized rugosities are ideally located for resisting torsional loading on the foot. Sparser Sharpey’s fibers occur at expected locations in other arctometatarsus-bearing coelurosaurs. In contrast, the Coelophysis metatarsal lacked Sharpey’s fibers or rugosity at the sectioned location, acting as a definitive negative control for identifying these features in tyrannosaurids. With soft-tissue correlates confirmed as ligament entheses, we conclude that tyrannosaurids possessed distinctive and specific ligament attachments to the third metatarsal lacking in other large carnivorous dinosaurs. Histological evidence for extensive distal intermetatarsal ligaments is consistent with greater inferred agility in derived tyrannosaurid dinosaurs than in earlier lineages of large theropods."
348,,1963.0,Morphological and functional development of the ovary of the mouse. I. Morphology and histochemistry of the developing ovary in normal conditions and after FSH treatment.,"Maturation and maintenance of ovarian function are under the control of the pituitary gonadotrophins. The capacity of the ovary to respond to FSH stimulation develops gradually with age, and is most pronounced when the animal approaches sexual maturity. In very young animals reactivity to gonadotrophins is found to be lacking, and up to a certain age, which is characteristic for each species, sexual maturity cannot be accelerated by exogenous gonadotrophic stimulation (for references see Price & Ortize, 1944). However, in transplantation experiments of young ovarian tissue into adult spayed hosts, the grafted ovary reaches maturity much earlier than in its normal surroundings (Goodman, 1934; Dunham, Watts & Adair, 1941).

In an attempt to clarify further the influence of the adult host on the development and maturation of the ovary, the normal growth of the mouse ovary and its reactivity to FSH from birth to maturity has been compared with the development of these young ovaries transplanted into adult hosts."

Having started their intensive development two decades ago, their low cost, processability and flexibility rapidly funneled the interest of the scientific community, searching for new solutions to expand solar photovoltaics market and promote sustainable development. However, their robust implementation is hampered by some issues, concerning the choice of the donor/acceptor materials, the device thermal/photo-stability, and, last but not least, their morphology. Indeed, the morphological profile of BHJs has a strong impact over charge generation, collection, and recombination processes; control over nano/microstructural morphology would be desirable, aiming at finely tuning the device performance and overcoming those previously mentioned critical issues. The employ of compatibilizers has emerged as a promising, economically sustainable, and widely applicable approach for the donor/acceptor interface (D/A-I) optimization. Thus, improvements in the global performance of the devices can be achieved without making use of more complex architectures. Even though several materials have been deeply documented and reported as effective compatibilizing agents, scientific reports are quite fragmentary. Here we would like to offer a panoramic overview of the literature on compatibilizers, focusing on the progression documented in the last decade."

These surfaces can act as a potential source of transmission. Therefore, effective disinfection strategies are urgently needed. We investigated the efficacy of ultraviolet C light (UV-C) disinfection for C. auris isolates belonging to 4 different clades. Methods: In vitro testing of C. auris isolates was conducted using 106 colony-forming units (CFU) spread on 20-mm diameter steel carriers and exposed to a broad-spectrum UV-C light source for 10, 20, and 30 minutes at a 1.5 m (5 feet) distance. Post-UV survivors on the coupons were subsequently plated. Colony counts and log reductions were recorded, calculated, and compared to untreated control carriers. Identification of all isolates were confirmed by MALDI-TOF and morphology was visualized by microscopy. Results: We observed an increased susceptibility of C. auris to UV-C in 8 isolates belonging to clades I, II and IV with increasing UV exposure time. The range of log kill (0.8–1.19) was highest for these isolates at 30 minutes. But relatively no change in log kill (0.04–0.35) with increasing time in isolates belonging to clade III were noted. Interestingly, C. auris isolates susceptible to UV-C were mostly nonaggregating, but the isolates that were more resistant to UV exposure formed aggregates. Conclusions: Our study suggests variability in susceptibility to UV-C of C. auris isolates belonging to different clades. More studies are needed to assess whether a cumulative impact of prolonged UV-C exposure provides additional benefit."

Mobile robots can move according to the control signals encoded by hand gestures. The gesture region is segmented from complicated background and the gestures are recognized by using some techniques such as image processing, image filtering processing, morphological image processing, image contour processing, etc. Then a template matching algorithm is proposed with the help of the invariant moment matching method to recognize the hand gestures. The recognition results are decoded as feedback information to control the mobile robots. Finally, some simulation results are provided to validate the proposed control algorithm."
352,10.1002/jmor.1051900310,1986.0,Sponge dermal membrane morphology: Histology of cell‐mediated particle transport during skeletal growth,"The keratose demosponge, Dysidea etheria, secretes a skeletal network of interconnecting spongin fibers and incorporates sand grains and other foreign particles into the fibers. Previous studies showed that foreign particles enhanced fiber growth and increased the stiffness of skeletal fibers. The present study uses light and electron microscopy to study the mechanism of particle incorporation. These histological observations show that particles become engulfed into thickened regions of the mesohyl of the dermal membrane, whereupon ameboid cells contact particles and secrete an electron dense layer of extracellular material onto the particle surface. Within several days, particles are moved towards primary skeletal fibers located at cone‐shaped protuberances on the sponge surface called conules. Particles accumulate at conules and are consolidated by secretion of spongin at the growing fiber apices. The observations suggest that coordinated migration of groups of mesohyl cells control particle transport to conules and that patterns of cell migration are associated with the structural organization of the dermal membrane. Particle transport may be homologous and analogous to spicule transport in other demosponges."

The mantle is a thin membrane of skirt‐like shape, which extends minutely beyond the aperture, and its edge adds a shell increment to the aperture margin so that each increment copies a configuration of the mantle edge at that time. Thus, regulation of shell morphogeny is almost equivalent to the factors which control the mantle form at the moment of shell growth. Form of the mantle skirt is considered to be kept in a state of balance between the force of its internal stress and forces acting on it such as fluid pressure or muscle contraction."

At the premises of companies that import used tyres from risk areas, the CMV implements surveillance using adult mosquito traps. In case of an IMS finding at a used tyre company location, the monitoring is intensified here (weekly sampling, additional BG-Sentinel traps and larval sampling), as well as within a predefined area with a radius of 500 m from the limits of the used tyre company location. On September 6th, 2021, eight Aedes larvae were found in a sample taken from a water-containing bucket. These larvae were both morphologically and molecularly (Illumina sequencing) identified as Aedes koreicus. Additional sampling at this first finding site of Ae. koreicus in the Netherlands, which was followed by mosquito control using larvicides, did not lead to further findings of the species."
355,10.1039/C0JM02109A,2011.0,A new insight into controlling poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanofiber growth through a mixed-solvent approach for organic photovoltaics applications,"One dimensional (1-D) nanostructures of conjugated polymers, such as nanofibers, offer the possibility of directed charge transport and improved absorption due to better chains ordering. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) nanofibers can be synthesized by utilizing its interaction with marginal solvents. This work explores the effect of different poor solvents in driving P3HT chain self-assembly into nanofibers and also the effect of a small amount of good solvent in such a poor solvent system in controlling the nanofiber morphology. The organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices based on the blend of P3HT nanofibers and PCBM showed an improved short circuit current when anisole was used compared to p-xylene. Surprisingly, the presence of a small amount of good solvent such as chlorobenzene (CB) in anisole resulted in a higher degree of crystallinity and thinner nanofibers compared to purely anisole system. These are evident from the absorption, scattering and morphology data. The presence of CB delayed crystallization, which is evident from the synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. This modification of fiber morphology with CB addition into P3HT/anisole results in an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.3%; an improvement of more than 50% compared to the pure anisole system. Our investigation provides a new insight into self-assembly of polymers in a mixed solvent system, paving the way to new approaches of controlled self-assembly of organic nanofibers."

The morphology of the flipper from a 9.02‐m whale was evaluated with regard to this hydrodynamic function. The flipper had a wing‐like, high aspect ratio plan‐form. Rounded tubercles were regularly interspersed along the flipper's leading edge. The flipper was cut into 71 2.5‐cm cross‐sections and photographed. Except for sections near the distal tip, flipper sections were symmetrical with no camber. Flipper sections had a blunt, rounded leading edge and a highly tapered trailing edge. Placement of the maximum thickness placement for each cross‐section varied from 49% of chord at the tip to 19% at mid‐span. Section thickness ratio averaged 0.23 with a range of 0.20–0.28. The humpback whale flipper had a cross‐sectional design typical of manufactured aerodynamic foils for lift generation. The morphology and placement of leading edge tubercles sugges that they function as enhanced lift devices to control flow over the flipper and maintain lift at high angles of attack. The morphology of the humpback whale flipper suggests that it is adapted for high maneuverability associated with the whale's unique feeding behavior. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."
357,10.1002/adma.201705243,2018.0,Ternary System with Controlled Structure: A New Strategy toward Efficient Organic Photovoltaics,"Recently, a new type of active layer with a ternary system has been developed to further enhance the performance of binary system organic photovoltaics (OPV). In the ternary OPV, almost all active layers are formed by simple ternary blend in solution, which eventually leads to the disordered bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure after a spin‐coating process. There are two main restrictions in this disordered BHJ structure to obtain higher performance OPV. One is the isolated second donor or acceptor domains. The other is the invalid metal–semiconductor contact. Herein, the concept and design of donor/acceptor/acceptor ternary OPV with more controlled structure (C‐ternary) is reported. The C‐ternary OPV is fabricated by a sequential solution process, in which the second acceptor and donor/acceptor binary blend are sequentially spin‐coated. After the device optimization, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all OPV with C‐ternary are enhanced by 14–21% relative to those with the simple ternary blend; the best PCEs are 10.7 and 11.0% for fullerene‐based and fullerene‐free solar cells, respectively. Moreover, the averaged PCE value of 10.4% for fullerene‐free solar cell measured in this study is in great agreement with the certified one of 10.32% obtained from Newport Corporation."

Over the past decades, remarkable advances in device efficiency close to 20% have been made for bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-based OPV devices (OPVs) with long-term stability, and room for further improvements still exists. In recent years, ancillary components have been demonstrated as effective in improving the photovoltaic performance of OPVs by controlling the optoelectronic and morphological properties of BHJ blends. Herein, we provide an updated understanding of polymer-based blend OPVs and then categorize and discuss the role and impact of ancillary components in various blend systems. Lastly, we provide a strategic perspective on the ancillary components of blend-based OPVs for commercialization."
359,10.1002/ADMA.200601093,2007.0,Device Physics of Polymer:Fullerene Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells,"Plastic solar cells bear the potential for large‐scale power generation based on materials that provide the possibility of flexible, lightweight, inexpensive, efficient solar cells. Since the discovery of the photoinduced electron transfer from a conjugated polymer to fullerene molecules, followed by the introduction of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept, this material combination has been extensively studied in organic solar cells, leading to several breakthroughs in efficiency, with a power conversion efficiency approaching 5 %. This article reviews the processes and limitations that govern device operation of polymer:fullerene BHJ solar cells, with respect to the charge‐carrier transport and photogeneration mechanism. The transport of electrons/holes in the blend is a crucial parameter and must be controlled (e.g., by controlling the nanoscale morphology) and enhanced in order to allow fabrication of thicker films to maximize the absorption, without significant recombination losses. Concomitantly, a balanced transport of electrons and holes in the blend is needed to suppress the build‐up of the space–charge that will significantly reduce the power conversion efficiency. Dissociation of electron–hole pairs at the donor/acceptor interface is an important process that limits the charge generation efficiency under normal operation condition. Based on these findings, there is a compromise between charge generation (light absorption) and open‐circuit voltage (VOC) when attempting to reduce the bandgap of the polymer (or fullerene). Therefore, an increase in VOC of polymer:fullerene cells, for example by raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of the fullerene, will benefit cell performance as both fill factor and short‐circuit current increase simultaneously."
360,10.1002/jmor.21430,2021.0,Dentin hardness differences across various mammalian taxa,"Differences in dentin microstructure have been used as a tool for dietary reconstruction; however, the extent that diet is associated with this aspect of dental morphology has yet to be empirically tested. We conducted microhardness tests of mammalian dentin sections, hypothesizing that species with adaptations to particularly hard diets would have softer dentin, owing to a higher proportion of soft intertubular dentin. Species adapted to abrasive diets, in contrast, should have harder dentin, resulting from a higher proportion of hypermineralized peritubular dentin. We examined molar dentin hardness in ten mammalian taxa with durophagous diets, abrasive diets, and a comparative “control” group of mechanical generalists. Samples included six primate taxa and four non‐primate species representing various dietary regimes. Our results reveal significant variation among taxa in overall hardness, but the data do not distinguish between hard and abrasive diets. Several taxa with generalized (i.e., mechanically diverse) diets resemble each other in exhibiting large variance in hardness measurements and comparably soft dentin. The high variation in these species appears to be either a functional signal supporting the niche variation hypothesis or indicate the absence of sustained unidirectional selective pressure. A possible phylogenetic signal of dentin hardness in the data also holds promise for future systematic investigations."

NSEs of oral polio vaccine (OPV) were not examined. If OPV vaccination campaigns reduce the mortality rate, it would suggest beneficial NSEs. Setting Between 2002 and 2014, Guinea-Bissau had 15 general OPV campaigns and other campaigns with OPV plus vitamin A supplementation (VAS), VAS-only, MV, and H1N1 vaccine. In this period, we conducted seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mortality as main outcome. Methods Within these RCTs, we assessed whether the mortality rate was lower after-campaign than before-campaign. We used Cox models with age as underlying time and further adjusted for low birth-weight, season and time trend in mortality. We calculated the adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR) for after-campaign vs before-campaign. Results The mortality rate was lower after OPV-only campaigns than before, the MRR being 0.81 (95% CI = 0.68–0.95). With each additional dose of campaign-OPV the mortality rate declined further (MRR = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79–0.96) per dose) (test for trend, p = 0.005). No other type of campaign had similar beneficial effects. Depending on initial age and with follow-up to 3 years of age, the number needed to treat with campaign-OPV-only to save one life was between 68 and 230 children. Conclusion Bissau had no case of polio infection so the results suggest that campaign-OPV has beneficial NSEs. Discontinuation of OPV-campaigns in low-income countries may affect general child mortality levels negatively."

Human serum albumin (HSA) was used as a proxy marker for organic material, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the impact on bacterial cell structure. The inoculated surfaces were exposed to a cold-air-plasma–generating multijet prototype for 15, 20, 30, and 45 seconds. RESULTS After 45 seconds, at least 3 to 4 log reductions were achieved for all bacteria on the mattress, while 3 to 6 log reductions were observed on stainless steel. The presence of HSA had no appreciable effect on bacterial eradication. The surfaces with bacteria exposed to AFM showed significant morphological changes indicative of “etching” due to the action of highly charged ions produced by the plasma. CONCLUSION This multijet cold-plasma prototype has the potential to augment current environmental decontamination approaches but needs further evaluation in a clinical setting to confirm its effectiveness.

Int. :1032-1038, 2020. SUMMARY: The study was conducted to examine the histological changes i.e. morphology and biometry of immune organs (thymus, spleen and bursa cloacalis or «Fabricius») of broilers in response to dietary dexamethasone (DEX). The day old chicks were obtained from the commercial hatchery and randomly divided into two groups i.e. control and experimental or treated group. The control group was reared on commercial broiler ration and the experimental group (n=25) was maintained on commercial broiler ration with corticosteroid (Dexamethasone-Decason, BP 0.5 mg, Opsonin @ 7 mg/kg feed). Samples (bursa cloacalis, spleen, and thymus) were collected from the ten control and ten experimental broilers at 14 and 28 days of experiment; then tissues were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. The biometric measurements of the samples were performed by the calibrated stage micrometer. Finally, the obtained data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 software. In DEX treated group, the morphology of thymus, spleen and bursa cloacalis did not show any abnormal alterations. But their development rate was slower on visual inspection in DEX treated group. The length and width of bursal follicle of bursa cloacalis, thymic lobule of thymus and white pulp of spleen were statistically consisted but numerically decreased in DEX treated group than the control. The present findings suggested that DEX does not affect the histological architectures of immune organs except causing developmental arrest. Numerical decrease in the biometry of immune organs indicates that DEX causes apoptosis of immune cells in lymphoid organs of broiler."
364,10.1021/nl303419n,2012.0,Fluorinated copper phthalocyanine nanowires for enhancing interfacial electron transport in organic solar cells.,"Zinc oxide is a promising candidate as an interfacial layer (IFL) in inverted organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to the n-type semiconducting properties as well as chemical and environmental stability. Such ZnO layers collect electrons at the transparent electrode, typically indium tin oxide (ITO). However, the significant resistivity of ZnO IFLs and an energetic mismatch between the ZnO and the ITO layers hinder optimum charge collection. Here we report that inserting nanoscopic copper hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F(16)CuPc) layers, as thin films or nanowires, between the ITO anode and the ZnO IFL increases OPV performance by enhancing interfacial electron transport. In inverted P3HT:PC(61)BM cells, insertion of F(16)CuPc nanowires increases the short circuit current density (J(sc)) versus cells with only ZnO layers, yielding an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼3.6% vs ∼3.0% for a control without the nanowire layer. Similar effects are observed for inverted PTB7:PC(71)BM cells where the PCE is increased from 8.1% to 8.6%. X-ray scattering, optical, and electrical measurements indicate that the performance enhancement is ascribable to both favorable alignment of the nanowire π-π stacking axes parallel to the photocurrent flow and to the increased interfacial layer-active layer contact area. These findings identify a promising strategy to enhance inverted OPV performance by inserting anisotropic nanostructures with π-π stacking aligned in the photocurrent flow direction."
365,10.1002/jmor.21040,2019.0,Functional cytology of the hepatopancreas of decapod crustaceans,"This article reviews the morphogenesis, morphology, histology, ultrastructure, and structural–functional relationships of the hepatopancreas, the main metabolic organ of the Decapoda. The hepatopancreas develops in early larval stages from a pair of lateral lobes of the midgut anlage. In adults, it consists of hundreds of blindly ending tubules that are enveloped by a muscle net consisting of longitudinal and circular fibers. Stem cells at the distal ends of the tubules give rise to three ultrastructurally different epithelial cell types, the R‐, F‐, and B‐cells. Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and monitoring of ultrastructural changes under different experimental conditions allowed the attribution of functions to these cell types. R‐cells serve for the absorption and metabolization of nutrients, storage of energy reserves and minerals, synthesis of lipoproteins for export to other organs, detoxification of heavy metals, and excretion of uric acid. F‐cells synthesize digestive enzymes and blood proteins involved in oxygen transport and immune defense. They also detoxify some heavy metals and probably organic xenobiotics. B‐cells are assumed to produce and recycle fat emulsifiers. The hepatopancreas tubules lack nerves. The presence of scattered M‐cells with putative endocrine function in the epithelium suggests that the hepatopancreas is mainly hormonally controlled. M‐cells probably represent a self‐perpetuating cell lineage independent from E‐cells. The interstitium between the tubules contains connective tissue, arterioles, hemolymph with circulating hemocytes, and fixed phagocytes that eliminate pathogens. The hepatopancreas is histologically and ultrastructurally uniform throughout the Decapoda, despite their broad variety in body size, morphology, life style, and ecology. However, in a few cavernicolous and deep‐sea shrimps parts of the hepatopancreas are transformed into large oil storing and bioluminescent compartments. Within the malacostracan crustaceans, the hepatopancreas of the Decapoda is most similar to the digestive gland of the Euphausiacea, supporting close taxonomic relationship of these two taxa."

[ 4 ] To date, a power conversion effi ciency (PCE) over 5% has been obtained by using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) [ 5 ] or other low-bandgap polymers [ 6 ] as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C 60 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. One of the most important issues of PSCs is that the effi ciency is lower than conventional Si-based solar cells or dyesensitized solar cells. [ 7 ] Various approaches for morphology control such as thermal annealing, [ 8 ] solvent annealing, [ 9 ] solvent mixture, [ 10 a–e] and microwave annealing [ 10 f ] have been proposed to increase the effi ciency. These methods have been very effective to give nanoscale phase-separated morphology in the horizontal direction (parallel to the fi lm surface). However, the methods have limited control over the vertical distribution of the components in active layer, although the vertical distribution is very critical for effective transport of charge carriers.

This design is based on a variable geometry that can be changed during the flight. It is able to modify the orientation of its arms independently, thanks to its special morphology. This quadrotor, exploits simple mechanisms i.e. rotating arms. We stress that the control of this category of robots is not obvious compared to the conventional ones. So, a detailed generic model and backstepping control that take into account the variation of the center of gravity and the inertia are presented. Simulation results are also provided in order to illustrate the performances of this controller."

From an industrial perspective, green solvents are necessary for the roll-to-roll production of OPV modules. In this study, we fabricated nonfullerene (NF) OPV devices that are based on the blend films of PTB7-Th and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) by using o-xylene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the processing solvents and chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene as the control solvents. We compared the variations in the ultraviolet visible absorption, atomic force microscopy-derived phase morphologies, space-charge-limited current carrier mobilities, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the related OPV devices. The high solubility of ITIC and PTB7-Th in the solvents yielded PCE of 8.11% and 6.79% for the o-xylene- and THF-derived devi..."

In the United States, esophageal SCC is relatively uncommon compared with AdenoCA, with only few detailed immunohistochemical (IHC) studies on esophageal SCC. We characterized p40 and p63 IHC across various grades of squamous differentiation in esophageal SCC and compared their sensitivities between esophageal SCC and adenoCA. Twenty-eight esophageal SCC and 26 esophageal adenoCA (control group) samples were stained for p40, p63, and CK5/6. All hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained SCC slides were reviewed. Tumors were graded according to the World Health Organization classification: well, moderately, or poorly differentiated (WD, MD, and PD, respectively). Considering morphological heterogeneity, individual differentiation components within the same tumor were scored separately (0% to 100%) according to the proportion of immunoreactive cells and marked as positive (≥5%) or negative (<5%). Among 28 esophageal SCC, 15 had mixed intratumoral differentiation. There were 16 WD, 19 MD, and 14 PD components. P40 immunoreactivity was significantly lower in WD than in MD or PD components (P<0.001), P63 immunoreactivity patterns were similar (P<0.001), while CK5/6 showed no differences (P>0.05). The sensitivities for SCC components were 98% (P40), 100% (P63), and 100% (CK5/6), while those for esophageal AdenoCA were significantly lower: 4% (P40), 4% (P63), and 8% (CK5/6). P40 and P63 were sensitive and specific for routine esophageal SCC diagnosis. However, their immunostaining was significantly lower in WD SCC than in higher grade tumors. IHC results for small biopsy specimens should be interpreted carefully, particularly in WD components."
370,10.1002/advs.201903419,2020.0,17.1% Efficient Single‐Junction Organic Solar Cells Enabled by n‐Type Doping of the Bulk‐Heterojunction,"Molecular doping is often used in organic semiconductors to tune their (opto)electronic properties. Despite its versatility, however, its application in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) remains limited and restricted to p‐type dopants. In an effort to control the charge transport within the bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) of OPVs, the n‐type dopant benzyl viologen (BV) is incorporated in a BHJ composed of the donor polymer PM6 and the small‐molecule acceptor IT‐4F. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells is found to increase from 13.2% to 14.4% upon addition of 0.004 wt% BV. Analysis of the photoactive materials and devices reveals that BV acts simultaneously as n‐type dopant and microstructure modifier for the BHJ. Under optimal BV concentrations, these synergistic effects result in balanced hole and electron mobilities, higher absorption coefficients and increased charge‐carrier density within the BHJ, while significantly extending the cells' shelf‐lifetime. The n‐type doping strategy is applied to five additional BHJ systems, for which similarly remarkable performance improvements are obtained. OPVs of particular interest are based on the ternary PM6:Y6:PC71BM:BV(0.004 wt%) blend for which a maximum PCE of 17.1%, is obtained. The effectiveness of the n‐doping strategy highlights electron transport in NFA‐based OPVs as being a key issue."

The mesh patterning can be accurately controlled in order to significantly enhance the electrode transparency, with a subsequent slight increase in the sheet resistance, and therefore improve the tradeoff between transparency and conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers. In particular, rGO films with an initial transparency of ≈20% are patterned, resulting in rGOMMs films with a ≈59% transmittance and a sheet resistance of ≈565 Ω sq−1, that is significantly lower than the resistance of ≈780 Ω sq−1, exhibited by the pristine rGO films at the same transparency. As a proof‐of‐concept application, rGOMMs are used as the transparent electrodes in flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, achieving power conversion efficiency of 3.05%, the highest ever reported for flexible OPV devices incorporating solution‐processed graphene‐based electrodes. The controllable and highly reproducible laser‐induced patterning of rGO hold enormous promise for both rigid and flexible large‐scale organic electronic devices, eliminating the lag between graphene‐based and indium–tin oxide electrodes, while providing conductivity and transparency tunability for next generation flexible electronics."
372,10.1002/jmor.10732,2009.0,Turning maneuvers in sharks: Predicting body curvature from axial morphology,"Given the diversity of vertebral morphologies among fishes, it is tempting to propose causal links between axial morphology and body curvature. We propose that shape and size of the vertebrae, intervertebral joints, and the body will more accurately predict differences in body curvature during swimming rather than a single meristic such as total vertebral number alone. We examined the correlation between morphological features and maximum body curvature seen during routine turns in five species of shark: Triakis semifasciata, Heterodontus francisci, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, Chiloscyllium punctatum, and Hemiscyllium ocellatum. We quantified overall body curvature using three different metrics. From a separate group of size‐matched individuals, we measured 16 morphological features from precaudal vertebrae and the body. As predicted, a larger pool of morphological features yielded a more robust prediction of maximal body curvature than vertebral number alone. Stepwise linear regression showed that up to 11 features were significant predictors of the three measures of body curvature, yielding highly significant multiple regressions with r2 values of 0.523, 0.537, and 0.584. The second moment of area of the centrum was always the best predictor, followed by either centrum length or transverse height. Ranking as the fifth most important variable in three different models, the body's total length, fineness ratio, and width were the most important non‐vertebral morphologies. Without considering the effects of muscle activity, these correlations suggest a dominant role for the vertebral column in providing the passive mechanical properties of the body that control, in part, body curvature during swimming.

Here, we report the use of morphological control of perovskite thin films to form semitransparent planar heterojunction solar cells with neutral color and comparatively high efficiencies. We take advantage of spontaneous dewetting to create microstructured arrays of perovskite ""islands"", on a length-scale small enough to appear continuous to the eye yet large enough to enable unattenuated transmission of light between the islands. The islands are thick enough to absorb most visible light, and the combination of completely absorbing and completely transparent regions results in neutral transmission of light. Using these films, we fabricate thin-film solar cells with respectable power conversion efficiencies. Remarkably, we find that such discontinuous films still have good rectification behavior and relatively high open-circuit voltages due to the inherent rectification between the n- and p-type charge collection layers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ease of ""color-tinting"" such microstructured perovksite solar cells with no reduction in performance, by incorporation of a dye within the hole transport medium."
374,10.1002/adma.201205216,2013.0,Organic Electronics,"Although the class of compounds called organic semiconductors was known from early 20th century, it is with the invention of organic light emitting diode (OLED) by Tang and Vanslyke in 1987, the new research area-organic electronics-began flourishing. With the progress made in synthetic techniques, purification processes, and fabrication technologies, OLEDs have matured into commercial applications. It is seen that organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells and organic thin film transistors (OTFT) are also following suite. Both polymers and small molecules have been widely studied for possible use in OLEDs, OPV, and OTFT. The prospect of developing flexible and printable electronics on large area makes this field further attractive. This special issue on Organic Electronics contains 5 research articles which cover organic solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, and back-plane technology for OLED based displays. Though tandem device structure could be employed to increase the open circuit voltage in organic solar cells, in certain cases this results in charge trapping at the interface and reduced filling factor. W. Nie et al. address this issue by doping the interconnect layer (ZnO) with Ag nanoparticles which results in the mitigation of trapping effect. In another article, dependence of performance on solution concentration of inverted organic solar cells based on eosin-Y-Coated ZnO nanorod arrays and MEHPPV and PCBM solutions have been studied by R. T. Ginting et al. R. Rahimi et al. have systematically studied the optical constants, morphology, and structure of thin films of an important perylene derivative, PTCDI-C8, which will be useful for device design and optimization. Enhanced charge carrier transport, optimized exciton distribution, and better harvesting of triplets excitons have been obtained by a mixed interlayer in a fluorescent bluephosphorescent yellow-white OLED by C.-H. Gao et al. A reasonably high efficiency of 29 lumens/watt underlines the importance of this device structure. The variations in the threshold voltages of driving TFT and theOLEDgive rise to nonuniform colors in anOLEDdisplay. One way of addressing this issue is to deploy more TFTs as part of compensating circuits. The compensation circuit, proposed by C.-L. Fan et al., promises excellent control over the variation in the threshold voltages of TFT andOLED.The circuit contains 5 TFTs and one capacitor. Any improvement in this area with low temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) is important as these problems aggravate as we go to larger and larger displays. We do believe that these articles not only enrich our knowledge about organic semiconductor devices but also indicate the existence of a lotmore technological issues which make the field organic electronics all the more attractive and challenging."

During this process, dental pulp tissue is subjected to structural and protein expression modifications in order to maintain their integrity and functional morphology. The purpose of the present work was to perform an in vivo study, evaluating protein expression modifications in the human dental pulp of patients that have undergone orthodontic tooth movement due to pre-calibrated light force application for 30 days. Dental pulp samples were extracted from molars and premolars of the control group and after 7 and 30 days of treatment; the samples were then processed for immunofluorescence reactions using antibodies against fibronectin, collagen I and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our results show that, after 7 days of treatment, all tested proteins change their pattern expression and will reset after 30 days. These data demonstrate that the dental pulp does not involve any irreversible iatrogenic alterations, supporting the efficacy and safety of using pre-calibrated force application to induce orthodontic tooth movement in clinical practice."
376,10.1093/infdis/jir723,2012.0,"Safety and immunogenicity of inactivated poliovirus vaccine made from Sabin strains: a phase II, randomized, positive-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND
The production of Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) can reduce biosafety requirements in the posteradication/post-oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) era. We conducted a phase II, randomized, positive-controlled trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Sabin IPV.


METHODS
The test groups (A, B, and C) received 3 doses of high, middle, and low D antigen (D Ag) of Sabin IPV at ages 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. Infants in 2 control groups, group D and group E, received 3 doses of trivalent OPV and conventional IPV (cIPV), respectively, on the same schedule as that of groups A, B, and C. Serum samples were collected before and 30 days after the administration of the third dose.


RESULTS
In total, 500 infants were randomly assigned to 5 groups, and 449 infants completed the vaccine series. No serious adverse events were associated with vaccinations. After 3 doses, the seroconversion rates in groups A, B, C, D, and E were 100%, 97.8%, 96.6%, 100%, and 90.1%, respectively, for type 1 poliovirus; 97.7%, 95.7%, 78.7%, 100%, and 90.1%, respectively, for type 2; and 98.8%, 98.9%, 93.3%, 100%, and 97.8%, respectively, for type 3.


CONCLUSIONS
Sabin IPV has good safety characteristics. The seroconversion rates for type 1 poliovirus (most appropriate concentration, 15 D Ag units [DU]), type 2 (32 DU), and type 3 (45 DU) Sabin IPV were similar to those of the OPV and cIPV control groups.

377,10.1148/radiol.12111785,2012.0,Obliterative portal venopathy: findings at CT imaging.,"PURPOSE
To retrospectively analyze the computed tomographic (CT) findings in a single-center series of adult patients with biopsy-proved obliterative portal venopathy (OPV) and to compare them with those observed in patients with cirrhosis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The requirement for informed consent was waived. This institutional review board-approved study included 42 consecutive patients with a histologically proved diagnosis of OPV who underwent CT at diagnosis. The clinical characteristics at diagnosis were recorded, and CT examination results were reviewed. Two radiologists evaluated portal vein patency and intrahepatic portal branches, the morphologic changes in the liver, the presence of hepatic nodules, and signs of portal hypertension in consensus. The control group consisted of 42 patients who had histologically proved cirrhosis. CT findings were compared between the OPV patient group and the cirrhotic group and also among the conditions associated with patients with OPV. The Fisher exact test was used. P values of .05 or less were considered to indicate significant differences.


RESULTS
The following CT findings were observed significantly more frequently in OPV than in cirrhosis: extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (18 [43%] of 42 vs five [12%] of 42); intrahepatic portal abnormalities (18 [58%] of 31 vs one [2%] of 42) such as reduced caliber, occlusive thrombosis, and lack of visibility; focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules (six [14%] of 42 vs 0 [0%] of 42); and perfusion disorders (15 [36%] of 42 vs six [14%] of 42). Conversely, the combination of hypertrophy of the caudate lobe and atrophy of segment IV (27 [64%] of 42 vs 10 [24%] of 42) and nodular surface (37 [88%] of 42 vs seven [17%] of 42) were seen significantly more often in cirrhosis.


CONCLUSION
Characteristic CT findings in patients with OPV that differ from those in patients with cirrhosis were shown, the most common being the presence of intra- or extrahepatic portal abnormalities."

Herein, we design and synthesize 12 new conjugated D–A copolymers, employing ethynylene linkages for this control. We explore D–A combinations of fluorene, benzodithiophene, and diketopyrrolopyrrole with analogues of pyromellitic diimide, thienoisoindoledione, isothianaphthene, thienopyrazine, and thienopyrroledione. Computational modeling suggests the ethynylene-containing polymers can adopt virtually planar conformations, while many of the analogous polyarylenes lacking the ethynylene linkage are predicted to have quite twisted backbones (>35°). The introduction of ethynylene linkages into these D–A systems universally results in a significant blue-shift in the absorbance spectra (by as much as 100 nm) and a deeper HOMO value (∼0.1 eV) as co..."
379,,1983.0,Control of events during early cleavage of the mouse embryo: an analysis of the '2-cell block'.,"Embryos from certain strains of mice do not develop into blastocysts when cultured in vitro from the 1- or 2-cell stages but arrest development as 2-cell embryos--a phenomenon referred to as the '2-cell block'. Reciprocal crosses between eggs and sperm of a 'blocking' (CFLP) and 'non-blocking' (F1) strain show that in this combination the genotype of the egg alone determines whether the embryo 'blocks' at the 2-cell stage (or continues retarded development to the 4- to 6-cell stage in a minority of cases). A comparison of molecular and cellular development in normal and 'blocked 2-cell' embryos was therefore undertaken to investigate the influence of these maternal components on early mouse development. The results show that the majority of 'blocked 2-cells' arrest development at a stage equivalent to the late 2-cell stage in terms of cellular and nuclear division, DNA synthesis, activation of the embryonic genome, qualitative and quantitative changes in amino acid uptake, polypeptide synthesis and morphological maturation of organelles. These observations are compatible with the notion that maternally inherited developmental information plays an important role in controlling early cleavage of the mouse embryo."
380,10.2105/AJPH.79.12.1648,1989.0,A ten-year experience in control of poliomyelitis through a combination of live and killed vaccines in two developing areas.,"We describe a successful program of poliomyelitis control using a combination of killed and live polio vaccines over a 10-year period in two developing areas, the West Bank and Gaza, adjacent to a relatively developed country, Israel. During the 1970s, immunization using live trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) in these areas covered more than 90 percent of the infant population. Nevertheless, the incidence of paralytic polio continued to be high, with many cases occurring in fully or partially immunized persons. It was thought that this could be due to interference with OPV take by other enteroviruses present in the environment due to poor sanitary conditions in these areas. A new policy combining five doses of OPV with two doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was adopted and implemented in 1978. In the 10 years since then, immunization coverage of infants increased to an estimated 95 percent and paralytic poliomyelitis has been controlled, despite exposure to wild poliovirus from neighboring countries including an outbreak in Israel in 1988. This experience suggests that wide coverage using the combination of IPV and OPV is an effective vaccination policy that may make eradication of polio possible even in developing areas."
381,,2013.0,Kinetic Control of Recombination in Organic Photovoltaics: The Role of Spin,"In photovoltaic diodes recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is a major loss process. Biological light harvesting complexes (LHCs) prevent recombination via the use of cascade structures, which lead to spatial separation of charge-carriers1. In contrast, the nanoscale morphology and high charge densities in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) give a high rate of electron-hole encounters, which should result in the formation of spin triplet excitons, as in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)2. OPVs would have poor quantum efficiencies if every encounter lead to recombination, but state-of-the-art OPVs demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency3. Here we show that this suppression of recombination can be engineered through the interplay between spin, energetics and delocalisation of electronic excitations in organic semiconductors. We use time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of model, high efficiency polymer-fullerene systems in which the lowest lying molecular triplet exciton (T1) (on the polymer) lies below the intermolecular charge transfer state (CT). We observe the formation of T1 states following bimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes generate CT states with both spin singlet (1CT) and spin triplet (3CT) characters. We show that triplet exciton formation can be the major loss mechanism in OPVs. However, we find that even when energetically favoured, the relaxation of 3CT to T1 can be strongly suppressed, via control over wavefunction delocalisation, allowing for the dissociation of 3CT back to free changes, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance. Our results point towards new design rules for artificial photo-conversion systems, enabling the suppression of electron-hole recombination, and also for OLEDs, avoiding the formation of triplet states and enhancing fluorescence efficiency."
382,10.31088/cem2021.10.4.72-80,2021.0,The role of adipose tissue in the healing of rat uterine wall after a full-thickness surgical incision,"Introduction. Data about the role of components of adipose tissue in the repair of damaged uterine walls are limited, although a number of authors claim that cell-based drugs from adipose tissue have a positive effect on the repair of damaged uterine walls in laboratory rodents. Meanwhile, stem cells derived from adipose tissue are considered to be the most promising type of cells in regenerative medicine. The aim of the studywas to evaluate the adipocyte components in the uterine wall of rats in healing after a full-thickness surgi-cal incision. Materials and methods. We conducted the study on 40 female Sprague Dawley rats. The animals were sub-jected to a full-thickness longitudinal incision in the wall of the right uterine horn, with the left one serving as an intact control. We carried out morphological examinations of the uterine walls daily in 5 animals from day 1 to 7 and on day 15. The sections from paraffin blocks were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Mallory’s trichrome staining. Immunohistochemistry detected FABP4+ adipocytes and CD68+ macrophages. The morphometric study was carried out using the Leica system (Leica, Germany). The results underwent processing in the Statistica 12 software (StatSoft). Results. We noticed the period of the most active interaction of adipose tissue with the damaged horn to last from day 3 to 15 and coincide with the macrophage activation in the healing zone. The intact left uterine horn was not involved in the interaction processes with the mesenteric adipose tissue. Starting from day 3 FABP4+ cells in the uterine wall of the operated horn formed groups, creating rounded nest-like structures. Clusters of FABP4+ cells were localized in the healing zone, near the suture material, and in the perime-trium near the mesentery attachment sites. The changes over time of the indicators of the area of cell nests depended on the localization and duration of healing. There were no FABP4+ cells in the left intact horn. Conclusion. We characterized the morphological interaction of adipose tissue with the damaged uterine wall during the first two weeks after a full-thickness surgical incision of the rat uterine horn. The results of the study indicate that adipocytes take an active part in the healing after a surgical incision of the rat uterine wall at the earliest stages.

383,10.1063/1.2718865,2007.0,A microscopic model for the behavior of nanostructured organic photovoltaic devices,"We present a Monte Carlo model of carrier separation and recombination in nanostructured organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices which takes into account all electrostatic interactions, energetic disorder, and polaronic effects. This permits a detailed analysis of the strong morphology dependence of carrier collection efficiency. We find that performance is determined both by the orientation of the heterojunction relative to the external electric field as well as by carrier confinement due to polymer intermixing. The model predicts that an idealized interdigitated structure could achieve overall efficiencies twice as high as blends. The model also reproduces the weakly sublinear intensity dependence of short-circuit photocurrent (ISC) seen in experiment. We show that this is not the result of space-charge effects but of bimolecular recombination. Disconnected islands of polymer in coarser blends result in bimolecular recombination even at low intensities and should therefore be minimized. By including a micros..."

Reported is a bottom‐up, supramolecular approach to BHJ OPVs wherein tailored hydrogen bonding (H‐bonding) interactions between π‐conjugated electron donor molecules encourage formation of vertically aligned donor π‐stacks while simultaneously suppressing lateral aggregation; the programmed arrangement facilitates fine mixing with fullerene acceptors and efficient charge transport. The approach is illustrated using conventional linear or branched quaterthiophene donor chromophores outfitted with terminal functional groups that are either capable or incapable of self‐complementary H‐bonding. When applied to OPVs, the H‐bond capable donors yield a twofold enhancement in power conversion efficiency relative to the comparator systems, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 64%. H‐bond promoted assembly results in redshifted absorption (in neat films and donor:C60 blends) and enhanced charge collection efficiency despite disparate donor chromophore structure. Both features positively impact photocurrent and fill factor in OPV devices. Film structural characterization by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and grazing incidence wide angle X‐ray scattering reveals a synergistic interplay of lateral H‐bonding interactions and vertical π‐stacking for directing the favorable morphology of the BHJ."

Despite the success of such bulk heterojunctions, the task ofcontrolling the microstructure in a single casting process has been arduous and alternative approaches are desired. To achieve OPVs with a desirable microstructure, a facile and eco‐compatible sequential deposition approach is demonstrated for polymer/small‐molecule pairs. Using a nominally amorphous polymer as the model material, the profound influence of casting solvent is shown on the molecular ordering of the film, and thus the device performance and mesoscale morphology of sequentially deposited OPVs can be tuned. Static and in situ X‐ray scattering indicate that applying (R)‐(+)‐limonene is able to greatly promote the molecular order of weakly crystalline polymers and form the largest domain spacing exclusively, which correlates well with the best efficiency of 12.5% in sequentially deposited devices. The sequentially cast device generally outperforms its control device based on traditional single‐ink bulk‐heterojunction structure. More crucially, a simple polymer:solvent interaction parameter χ is positively correlated with domain spacing in these sequentially deposited devices. These findings shed light on innovative approaches to rationally create environmentally friendly and highly efficient electronics."

[1–8] Commercial samples of ITO have work functions that vary from ca. 4.2–4.9 eV, depending on the commercial source and surface pretreatment. [1–4,6–13] This surface work function, however, is often not as high as would be desired for charge injection in contact with many organic hole-transport materials. The high surface energy of clean ITO, arising from its polar oxo and hydroxyl surface functional groups, [3,4,6,14] is also not well suited for the creation of robust interfaces with hydrophobic organic hole-transport materials. The ability to simultaneously tune both work function and surface energy is desirable to optimize device performance in both organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPV). Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a series of ﬂuorinated benzyl phosphonic acids (PAs) that result in highly tunable work function changes to the surface of ITO through straightforward adjustment of the molecular dipole in relation to the ITO surface. These studies follow closely on earlier studies where we demonstrated the tunability of ITO surfaces with a small family of alkane and aromatic PAs. [15] We accompany these studies with a new theoretical study of PA bonding to ITO surfaces, based on density functional theory (DFT), [16] carried out to provide further insight into the relation between work function change and the choice of PA modiﬁer. The work reported here signiﬁcantly expands our previous family of surface modiﬁers, using only ﬂuorinated aromatic PAs"

Such morphology could have an advantage in bulk heterojunction systems; however, precise control of the dimension morphology in a crystalline, interpenetrating architecture has not yet been realized. Here we present a simple, yet facile, crystallization technique for the growth of vertically oriented NPs utilizing a modified thermal evaporation technique that hinges on a fast deposition rate, short substrate-source distance, and ballistic mass transport. A broad range of organic semiconductor materials is beneficial from the technique to generate NP geometries. Moreover, this technique can also be generalized to various substrates, namely, graphene, PEDOT-PSS, ZnO, CuI, MoO3, and MoS2. The advantage of the NP architecture over the conventional thin film counterpart is demonstrated with an increase of power conversion efficiency of 32% in photovoltaics. This technique will advance the knowledge of organic semiconductor crystallization and create opportunities for the fabrication and processing of NPs for applications that include solar cells, charge storage devices, sensors, and vertical transistors."

Additional photophysical studies in reference PDI blends of the electronically inert poly(styrene) matrix address the enhanced PDI intermolecular solid‐state interactions. We resolve the process of resonance energy transfer from excited polymer hosts to PDI and the process of photoinduced hole transfer from PDI to the polymer hosts. We deduce the efficiency of charge‐transfer PDI photoluminescence (PL) quenching and we discuss the power‐law PL kinetics seen in the as‐spun systems. Next we determine the dependence of the device external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these blends, in a range of annealing temperatures and PDI loadings. Differential scanning calorimetry enables precise selection of annealing temperatures. Optical microscopy shows that annealing enhances the order characteristics in the PDI aggregates in the F8BT:PDI system. In the case of the TFB:PDI and PFB:PDI blends, AFM studies suggest the formation of PDI‐rich domains on the film/air interface. The degree of order in the π–π stacking of the PDI monomers is inferred by the UV–Vis and PL spectra of the blends. The extent of order characteristics in PDI aggregates is correlated with the thermal properties of the hosts that control PDI molecular mobility upon annealing. The efficient dispersion of disrupted PDI crystallites is proposed to form appropriate percolation networks that favor balanced extraction of photogenerated carriers."

In order to demonstrate the ideal junction, we fabricate the polymer solar cells with single junction(p/n), pin-layered junction (pin) or bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer. The photovoltaic performance is dramatically varied with its junction. And the pin junction has best performance under the sunlight due to its good carrier generation and transport. And also we investigated the temperature dependence of the active layer morphologies at each substrate temperature 60 − 160 °C during its spray-depositing. The domain of active layer became smaller with increasing substrate temperature. The pin-layered cell sprayed at 120 °C gives best photovoltaic performance. Thus, ESDUS enables us to control the junction and morphologies of active layer."
390,10.1093/CLINIDS/6.SUPPLEMENT_2.S438,1984.0,Poliomyelitis in India: prospects and problems of control.,"Based on many surveys of residual paralysis and limited surveillance, the incidence of acute paralytic poliomyelitis in India has been calculated to be 20-40 per 100,000 population per year; thus greater than 200,000 cases occur annually, or 500 every day. Although oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) has been highly effective in controlling outbreaks, its introduction in routine immunization programs has not succeeded in controlling poliomyelitis in India. This failure is the result of inappropriate immunization strategy and low rates of antibody response to vaccine virus. Injectable polio vaccine, although found to be highly effective in routine immunization programs, is very costly and in short supply. The annual immunization of the susceptible age group with OPV during a short period (pulse immunization) has been found to be highly effective; this strategy is recommended for national control of poliomyelitis."
391,10.1039/B706547G,2007.0,Hybrid polymer-metal oxide thin films for photovoltaic applications{,"We review progress in the development of organic–inorganic hybrid photovoltaic materials consisting of a conjugated polymer as an electron donor and a nanocrystalline metal oxide as the electron acceptor. We distinguish two main approaches: (1) where a rigid porous metal oxide structure is filled with polymer and (2) where metal oxide nanoparticles and polymer are co-deposited from solution to form a blend film. In the case of porous structures, performance is limited by the infiltration of polymer into the pores of the metal oxide and control of the nanostructure dimensions. In the case of blends, control of the blend morphology and transport between nanoparticles are limitations. In both cases, further improvements are possible by modifying the metal oxide organic interface to optimise charge transfer, by improving both inter- and intra-particle transport within the metal oxide phase, for example by the use of single crystalline nanorods, and by optimising the choice of electrode materials. Though unlikely to achieve the highest photocurrents, the polymer–metal oxide composites provide a model system to study the effects of interface properties and film morphology on the performance of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices."
392,10.1039/C8TC01584H,2018.0,The effect of 1D- and 2D-polymorphs on organic single-crystal optoelectronic devices: lasers and field effect transistors,"Rational design and fabrication of organic microcrystal polymorphs with controlled molecular-stacking arrangements provides an effective way to optimize the optical and electronic properties, but remains challenging owing to weak van der Waals’ intermolecular interactions associated with the kinetic process of crystal growth. In this paper, we synthesized a novel compound, 1,4-dimethoxy-2,5-di[bithiophenestyryl]benzene (TPDSB), which combines the high optical-gain of the oligomeric phenylene vinylene (OPV) core-moiety with enhanced charge transportation offered by bithiophene end-groups. Controlled fabrication of one-dimensional microwires (1D-MWs) and two-dimensional microdisks (2D-MDs) was achieved by controlling the growth temperature: 1D-MWs at 30 °C as a kinetically favored morphology and 2D-MDs at 2 °C as a thermodynamically stable product. We found that though both 1D-MWs and 2D-MDs belong to the monoclinic phase, their different molecular packing arrangements caused by different molecular conformations result in distinctly different optical and electrical properties. In particular, well-faceted 1D-MWs and 2D-MDs can function as yellow-emissive Fabry–Perot (FP) and red-emissive whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microlasers, respectively. Furthermore, single-crystal data reveal that TPDSB molecules adopt a planar conformation in 1D-MWs with relatively loose molecular-packing into rolled π-stacks, while twist molecules in 2D-MDs exhibit tight molecular-packing into slipped π-stacks. This makes 2D-MDs have a higher PL quantum yield (Φ), a lower lasing threshold and a higher carrier mobility than 1D-MWs. Our results demonstrated that these easily solution-processed organic microcrystal polymorphs might be optimized on the way to realizing electrically driven organic lasers."

The aim was to analyze the effects of concurrent training (CT) and intermittent fasting (IF) on cardiac remodeling. In total, 39 adult male Wistar rats were used, divided into four groups: control (C [n = 12]), fasting control (FC [n = 11]), training (T [n = 8]) and fasting training (FT [n = 8]).The CT protocol was composed of 12 sessions, with 30 minutes of aerobic training (AT) in the liquid medium at an intensity of 80 % of the anaerobic threshold, followed by resistance training (RT) with 4 series of 10 aquatic jumps at an corresponding to 50 % of body weight. The IF period was established at 12/12 hours, starting at 9 p.m. and ending at 9 a.m. Echocardiographic analyzes were performed before and after the intervention and, at the end of the experiment, samples of the cardiac tissue were collected to perform the histological analyses. Data analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk tests, Analysis of Variance - ANOVA with Tukey's post-test, and Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-test. All procedures assumed an error of 5 % (p<0.05). Neither group showed alterations in the functional (min. p= 0.12 - max. p= 0.83) and structural parameters of the heart (min. p=0.31 - max. p=0.83). A decrease was observed in the area of cardiomyocytes in the T (p=0.001) and FT groups (p=0.001). The CT and IF did not alter the functional and structural parameters of the heart, but did cause a decrease in the area of the cardiomyocytes."

However, its applications may damage to healthy tissues. Chloroquine (CLQ) is an anti-inflammatory agent used in treatment of many inflammation associated diseases such as malaria and rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, it is used in the treatment of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. The aim of this study is to determine possible therapeutic effects of Chloroquine on Adriamycin-induced testicular toxicity in rats. We investigated the effect of CLQ on testicular injury caused by ADR. Rats were divided into four groups: Control, ADR, CLQ, ADR+CLQ. After administrations, animals were sacrificed, and testis tissues were extracted from the animals for the further examinations. Histopathological changes in testis tissues were evaluated and TNF-a and IL-6 immunostaining were performed to determine the expression levels of these cytokines. TUNEL method were used for evaluation of apoptotic index. Moreover, serum testosterone levels were measured by ELISA assay. We observed that ADR group showed histopathological deterioration when compared to the Control group and CLQ treatment ameliorated this damage induced by Adriamycin. An increase in TNF-a and IL-6 immunoreactivities and in the number of apoptotic cells and a decrease in serum testosterone levels were determined in the ADR group compared to the Control and CLQ group. Furthermore, our examinations showed an improvement in testicular tissue in ADR+CLQ group in terms of these parameters when compared to the ADR group. We suggest that CLQ can be used as a protective agent to reduce the toxic effects of Adriamycin as a result of its antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties.

Un aumento en las inmunorreactividades de TNF-a e IL-6 y en el número de células apoptóticas además de una disminución en los niveles séricos de testosterona se determinaron en el grupo de ADR en comparación con el grupo de control y CLQ. Además, nuestros exámenes mostraron una mejora en el tejido testicular en el grupo ADR + CLQ en términos de estos parámetros en comparación con el grupo ADR. Sugerimos que CLQ se puede utilizar como agente protector para reducir los efectos tóxicos de la Adriamicina, gracias a sus propiedades antiinflamatorias y antiapoptóticas.

395,10.31393/morphology-journal-2021-27(1)-01,2021.0,Morphological changes in the heart of rats after serial intravesical administration of Doxorubicin,"Along with a pronounced antitumor effect, Doxorubicin causes systemic effects with damage to vital organs, including the heart. It prompts the search for ways to prevent the cardiotoxic effect of the drug, one of which could be its intravesical administration. The aim of the study was to develop a method of serial intravesical administration of Doxorubicin in medium therapeutic doses in an experiment and to evaluate the cardiotoxic effect of the drug. 42 female Wistar rats were included in the study. The control group consisted of 7 intact rats. The experimental group consisted of 35 rats who received intravesical chemotherapy with Doxorubicin at a dose of 5 mg/kg once a week for 5 weeks. On days 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th the hearts of experimental animals were taken for morphological examination. Histomorphometrically determined: the diameter of cardiomyocytes (in the middle part) and the transverse diameter of their nucleus, the width of the interstitial space (endo- and perimysium). The data of histomorphological and histomorphometric examination of the myocardium testified that all animals of the experimental group had a circulatory disorder in the heart muscle at the level of hemomicrocirculation. Such changes led to cardiomyocyte hypotrophy, interstitial edema and fibrosis. During intravesical chemotherapy, the animals showed marked changes in the myocardium, such as expansion of the endomysial zone, due to capillary congestion and edema, in comparison with animals of the intact group. At the end of the experiment, the animals of the experimental group retained the expansion of the endomysial zone, mainly due to interstitial fibrosis. Such changes indicate myocardial hypoxemia with damage and death of cardiomyocytes, activation of interstitial and replacement collagen formation. The obtained morphological data partially indicate the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in experimental animals. However, these changes were less pronounced than the previously described changes that occur after systemic administration of the drug. Additional studies of the electrophysiological activity of the heart and biochemical markers will make it possible to fully assess the degree of cardiotoxicity of Doxorubicin after its intravesical administration. Thus, serial intravesical administration of Doxorubicin in moderate therapeutic doses according to the proposed method causes changes in the myocardium of experimental animals, which are partially similar to the changes in the heart of people receiving chemotherapy with this drug."

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of quercetin on the microscopic organization of rat testicles, nitric oxide production and the intensity of oxidative stress in rat testicles on the 180th day of the experiment, during experimental central deprivation of luteinizing hormone synthesis caused by triptorelin solution. The experiment was performed on 20 adult male white rats. Rats were divided into 2 groups of 10 animals in each group: control group (I), group with central deprivation of LH synthesis + quercetin (II). Animals from the group with central deprivation of LH synthesis were injected subcutaneously with triptorelin acetate at a dose of 0.3 mg of active substance per kg and quercetin 100 mg per kg of body weight 3 times a week, while the control group was injected with saline. Ultrathin sections made by ultramicrotome were contrasted with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate according to the Reynolds method and examined by electron microscopy. According to standard methods, the material was poured into paraffin blocks, from which sections with a thickness of 4 μm were made and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological specimens were examined using a Вiorex 3 light microscope with a digital microfilter with software adapted for these studies. All biochemical studies were performed in 10 % of testicular tissue homogenate using a Ulab 101 spectrophotometer. Statistical processing of the study results was performed using Microsoft Office Excel software and Real Statistics 2019 extension. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between groups. Our study of the interstitial space in the testes of white rats showed the heterogeneity of populations of endocrinocytes and macrophages and the variability of structural and functional parameters. In the tissues of the testes in conditions of prolonged central deprivation of testosterone synthesis develops oxidative stress, which on the 180th day of the experiment leads to the development of edema of the interstitial space, followed by tissue fibrosis. Changes in the polarization of macrophages in our opinion may cause oxidative stress in the testes, as evidenced by increased iNOS activity and decreased arginase activity, but use of quercetin protects rat testicular tissue from oxidative damage caused by triptorelin by increasing direct antioxidant system and effects on the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism."

The interplay between hydrogen-bonding and π-stacking interactions was controlled by the bulkiness of the end functional groups, thereby resulting in aggregates of different types, which led to the gelation of a wide range of solvents. The variable-temperature UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic features of gelators with small end-groups revealed the formation of 1D H-type aggregates in CHCl(3). However, under fast cooling in toluene, 1D H-type aggregates were formed, whereas slow cooling resulted in 2D H-type aggregates. OPV amide with bulky dendritic end-group formed hydrogen-bonded random aggregates in toluene and a morphology transition from vesicles into fibrous aggregates was observed in THF. Interestingly, the presence of bulky end-group enhanced fluorescence in the xerogel state and aggregation in polar solvents. The difference between the aggregation properties of OPV amides with small and bulky end-groups allowed the preparation of self-assembled structures with distinct morphological and optical features."
398,,1994.0,"Poliomyelitis control in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip: changing strategies with the goal of eradication in an endemic area.","Israel has faced the challenge presented by epidemic poliomyelitis by using different immunization strategies. In the 1950s, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) helped to reduce the total burden of the disease, but cases continued to occur. Introduction of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in mid-1961 had a dramatic effect in controlling an extensive epidemic of poliomyelitis; however, poliovirus activity and cases continued during the 1970s, and at a low level in the 1980s. A localized outbreak of 15 cases of poliomyelitis in 1988 occurred in an area using enhanced potency IPV (eIPV) only. This led to a revision of poliomyelitis immunization policy. The successful poliomyelitis control in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip using both OPV and IPV since 1978 shows the advantages of a combined approach. This programme was therefore adopted in modified form in the whole of Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Since late 1988, no cases of poliomyelitis have occurred in any of these three areas, indicating the success of the combined poliomyelitis immunization programme. These experiences may be helpful to other countries, especially those where there is a danger of importation of wild poliovirus, and to prevent vaccine-associated disease. The combined approach provides an additional immunization model in the international effort to eradicate poliomyelitis."

However, predator‐specific modifications of the same defensive traits as an adaption to different predator regimes is so far only described for Daphnia barbata. It is unknown if this accounts only for this species or if it is a more widespread, general adaptive response in the genus Daphnia. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether a clone of the pond‐dwelling species Daphnia similis responds to different predatory invertebrates (Triops cancriformis; Notonecta maculata) with the expression of predator‐specific modifications of the same defensive traits. We showed that Triops‐exposed individuals express a significantly longer tail‐spine, while body width decreased in comparison to control individuals. Additionally, they also expressed inconspicuous defenses, that is, significantly longer spinules on the dorsal ridge. The Notonecta‐exposed D. similis showed a significantly longer tail‐spine, longer spinules and a larger spinules bearing area on the dorsal ridge than control individuals as well. However, a geometric morphometric analysis of the head shape revealed significant, predator‐specific changes. Triops‐exposed individuals expressed a flattened head shape with a pronounced dorsal edge, while Notonecta‐exposed individuals developed a high and strongly rounded head. Our study describes so far unrecognized inducible defenses of D. similis against two predators in temporary waters. Furthermore, the predator‐dependent change in head shape is in concordance with the ‘concept of modality’, which highlights the qualitative aspect of natural selection caused by predators."
400,10.1039/C8TC05378B,2018.0,Impact of solution temperature-dependent aggregation on the solid-state packing and electronic properties of polymers for organic photovoltaics,"The performance of a bulk-heterojunction organic solar cell critically depends on the morphology of the active layer. The solution temperature-dependent aggregation characteristics of a series of polymer donors have been recently exploited as an effective protocol for morphology control in high-efficiency devices. Here, we use an approach combining molecular dynamics simulations and long-range corrected density functional theory calculations to investigate the impact of solution temperature-dependent aggregation on the polymer solid-state packing and electronic properties. We consider two representative polymer systems: (i) PffBT4T-2OD (poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)]), and (ii) PBT4T-2OD (poly[(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2.2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quarterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)]), where the fluorine atoms on the benzothiadiazole moieties of PffBT4T-2OD are replaced with hydrogen atoms. We find that both temperature-dependent aggregation and the presence of fluorine atoms are important in determining the nature of the solid-state packing and the electronic properties in the polymer phases. Our results are consistent with the experimental data that show that PffBT4T-2OD aggregates at lower temperatures and leads to higher OPV efficiency."
401,10.1109/ACC.2014.6858637,2014.0,Dynamics of insect-inspired flapping-wing MAVs: Multibody modeling and flight control simulations,"Research on bio-inspired flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) has experienced a steady growth over the past two decades. In particular, experiments on insect flight dynamics may provide new solutions for various challenges ranging from morphological design to force control mechanisms. A significant amount of research in this area is focused on modeling and simulation of such dynamics; however, mass of the wings and corresponding inertia effects are often ignored for simplification purposes. In this paper, the MAV is considered to be a structure with three rigid bodies, i.e., a main body and two wings. Wing strokes are limited within the body's transverse plane, though each wing can also passively pitch around its lateral axis. Using the Lagrangian, a dynamic multibody model of this system is developed to ≪1≫ analyze the significance of wing mass in flight dynamics and ≪2≫ simulate flight control experiments. The employed control approach is based on investigated relationships between mechanical impedance properties of the wing pitch joints and average values of aerodynamic forces. The results suggest that the wings' mass and mechanical impedance properties of the joints can be optimized together to enhance lift/thrust production. In addition, simulations of various flight maneuvers with the optimized model and proposed control approach always demonstrate an agile and stable behavior."
402,10.1021/am508250q,2015.0,Highly reproducible thermocontrolled electrospun fiber based organic photovoltaic devices.,"In this work, we examined the reasons underlying the humidity-induced morphological changes of electrospun fibers and suggest a method of controlling the electrospun fiber morphology under high humidity conditions. We fabricated OPV devices composed of electrospun fibers, and the performance of the OPV devices depends significantly on the fiber morphology. The evaporation rate of a solvent at various relative humidity was measured to investigate the effects of the relative humidity during electrospinning process. The beaded nanofiber morphology of electrospun fibers was originated due to slow solvent evaporation rate under high humidity conditions. To increase the evaporation rate under high humidity conditions, warm air was applied to the electrospinning system. The beads that would have formed on the electrospun fibers were completely avoided, and the power conversion efficiencies of OPV devices fabricated under high humidity conditions could be restored. These results highlight the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed method for improving the reproducibility of electrospun nanofibers and performances of devices consisting of the electrospun nanofibers, regardless of the relative humidity."
403,10.1542/PEDS.101.2.242,1998.0,Modulation of the immune system by human milk and infant formula containing nucleotides.,"OBJECTIVE
To determine whether human milk and nucleotides added to infant formula at levels present in human milk enhance development of the immune system during infancy.


METHODS
A 12-month, controlled, randomized and blinded, multisite feeding trial was conducted on two infant formulas: iron-fortified, milk-based control formula (Control) or the same formula fortified with nucleotides (Nucleotide). The level (72 mg/L) and ratio of individual nucleotides selected were patterned after those available in human milk. A third group fed human milk exclusively for 2 months and then human milk or Similac with iron until 12 months of age also was studied. Response to immunizations was chosen to assess development of the immune system. Infants followed the immunization schedule recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1991.


OUTCOME VARIABLES
Antibody responses were determined at 6, 7, and 12 months of age to Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide (Hib), to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and to oral polio virus (OPV) immunizations.


RESULTS
Of 370 full-term, healthy infants enrolled, 311 completed the study (107 Control, 101 Nucleotide, 103 human milk/Similac with iron). Intake, tolerance, and growth of infants were similar in all three groups. Compared with the Control group 1 month after the third immunization (7 months of age), the Nucleotide group had a significantly higher Hib antibody concentration (geometric mean concentrations of 7.24 vs 4.05 micrograms/mL, respectively), and a significantly higher diphtheria antibody concentration (geometric mean of 1.77 vs 1.38 U/mL). The significantly higher Hib antibody response in the Nucleotide group persisted at 12 months. The antibody responses to tetanus and OPV were not enhanced by nucleotide fortification. There also was an effect of breastfeeding on immune response. Infants who breastfed had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers to polio virus than either formula-fed group (1:346 vs 1:169 and 1:192 in the Control and Nucleotide groups, respectively) at 6 months of age.


CONCLUSION
Infant formula fortified with nucleotides enhanced H influenzae type b and diphtheria humoral antibody responses. Feeding human milk enhanced antibody responses to OPV. Dietary factors play a role in the antibody response of infants to immunization."
