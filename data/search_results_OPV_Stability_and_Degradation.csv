0,10.3390/en14196324,2021.0,The Effect of OPV Module Size on Stability and Diurnal Performance: Outdoor Tests and Application of a Computer Model,"The outdoor performance of large area Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) is investigated in this work. Initially, the diurnal performance of the three modules is determined and found to be similar. Subsequently module degradation is monitored, and it is found that the larger area module displays a significantly greater stability as compared to the smallest area module; in fact the larger module displays a T50% (time to fall to 50% of its original value) of 191 days whilst the smallest module displays a T50% of 57 days. This is attributed to an increased level of water infiltration due to a larger perimeter-to-area ratio. These findings are then used to verify a computer simulation model which allows the model parameters, series and shunt resistances, to be calculated. It is determined that the series resistance is not an obvious obstruction at these module sizes. The findings of this work provide great promise for the application of OPV technology on a larger scale."
1,,2016.0,Interfacial stability and degradation in organic photovoltaic solar cells,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells show great promise but suffer from short operating lifetimes. This study examines the role that the selection of materials for the hole extraction interface in inverted OPV devices plays in determining the lifetime of a device. In the first part of the study, the effects of thermal degradation were examined. It was found that devices containing MoO3 HTLs and silver top electrodes exhibit an open-circuit voltage (VOC)/fill factor (FF)-driven mechanism. Physical characterisation experiments showed that, with heating, the silver electrode undergoes de-wetting. With thin electrodes this can result in the catastrophic failure of the device. A fracture analysis study found that silver-containing devices experience an increase in adhesion of their top layers to the active layer due to interdiffusion between the layers. This interdiffusion may be related to the loss of VOC and FF in Ag/MoO3 devices through diffused species forming charge traps in the active layer. In the second part of the study, the effects of photodegradation in different atmospheres were studied. Some material-dependent effects were observed when the devices were aged in an inert atmosphere, including variations in projected lifetime. The effect of oxygen was to greatly accelerate degradation, and remove any of the material-dependence observed in the inert experiment, while humidity led to a substantial increase in the degradation rate of devices containing PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate). This study underlines the importance of considering device lifetime in device design, and choosing materials to minimise degradation."
2,10.1002/9781119942436,2012.0,Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells: Krebs/Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells,"Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a new generation of solar cells with the potential to offer very short energy pay back times, mechanical flexibility and significantly lower production costs compared to traditional crystalline photovoltaic systems. A weakness of OPV is their comparative instability during operation and this is a critical area of research towards the successful development and commercialization of these 3rd generation solar cells. Covering both small molecule and polymer solar cells, Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells summarizes the state of the art understanding of stability and provides a detailed analysis of the mechanisms by which degradation occurs. Following an introductory chapter which compares different photovoltaic technologies, the book focuses on OPV degradation, discussing the origin and characterization of the instability and describing measures for extending the duration of operation."
3,10.1021/acsami.0c14461,2020.0,Incorporating Indium Selenide Nanosheets into a Polymer/Small Molecule Binary Blend Active Layer Enhances the Long-Term Stability and Performance of Its Organic Photovoltaics.,"In this report, we demonstrated that the incorporation of 15 wt % two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenide materials indium selenide (In2Se3) nanosheets into a polymer (PM6)/small molecule (Y6) active layer not only increased its light absorption but also enhanced the long-term stability of the PM6/Y6/In2Se3 ternary blend organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device was improved from 15.7 to 16.5% for the corresponding PM6/Y6 binary blend device. Moreover, the PM6/Y6/In2Se3 device retained 80% of its initial PCE after thermal treatment at 100 °C for 600 h; in comparison, the binary blend device retained only 62% of its initial value. This relative enhancement of 29% resulted from the In2Se3 nanosheets retarding or facilitating molecule packing in different orientations that stabilizes the morphology of the active layer. We adopted a modified kinetics model to account for the intrinsic degradation of the OPV; the degradation-facilitated energy for the degradation kinetics of the PCE for the ternary blend device was 5.3 kJ/mol, half of that (11.3 kJ/mol) of the binary blend device, indicating a slower degradation rate occurring for the case of incorporating In2Se3 nanosheets. Therefore, the incorporation of transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets having tunable band gaps and large asymmetric shape appears to be a new way to improve the long-term stability of devices and realize the practical use of OPVs."
4,,2015.0,Structural-Functional Characterization of Degradation Mechanisms in Low Bandgap Polymer-Fullerene OPV Devices,"Polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) show enormous promise for low cost renewable energy production. In an effort to increase device efficiencies, recent attention has turned toward the utilization of low bandgap conjugated polymers for photon harvesting. However, the stability of devices based on low bandgap materials remains poorly understood and represents one of the primary roadblocks for widespread OPV commercialization. Developing a systematic approach for studying degradation mechanisms in low bandgap OPVs is critical for improving device lifetimes. In this study, an experimental procedure for identifying the specific location and trigger of different degradation mechanisms is outlined. Emphasis is placed on in situ structural-functional characterization of different device materials under a variety of environmental conditions with a focus on machine learning techniques for flexible data analysis."
5,,2020.0,Degradation Behavior of Scalable Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells Assessed by Outdoor and Indoor ISOS Stability Protocols,"the scalable NFA OPV exhibit completely reversible degradation when assessed in ISOS - O - 1 outdoor conditions, which is in contrast to the lab - scale devices assessed via the indoor ISOS - L - 2 protocol. Results from transient photovoltage (TPV) indicate the presence of charge trap formation, and a number of potential mechanisms are proposed for the selective occurrence of this in lab - scale devices tested in ISOS - L lab conditions – ultimately concluding that it has its origins in the different device architectures used. The study points at the risk of assessing active layer stability from laboratory scale devices and degradation studies alone"
6,10.1002/adfm.202308618,2023.0,Influences of Metal Electrodes on Stability of Non‐Fullerene Acceptor‐Based Organic Photovoltaics,"Understanding chemical degradation at the interface between different layers in an organic photovoltaic device (OPV) is crucial to improving the long‐term stability of OPVs. Herein, molecular‐level insights are provided into the impact of different metal top electrodes on the interfacial morphology and stability of photoactive layers in PM6:Y6 bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs. OPVs with an aluminum (Al) top electrode exhibit inferior stability compared to silver (Ag) electrode devices upon thermal annealing, whereby thermal stress induces the diffusion of both Al and Ag atoms to the PM6:Y6 BHJ layer. The diffused Al atoms cause surface recombination at the interface between the photoactive layer and an interlayer. Specifically, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests the different local chemical environments of PM6 and Y6 moieties in PM6:Y6/Al‐contact devices. These results are corroborated by solid‐state nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements, indicating the formation of ionic and organo‐metallic‐like species at the sub‐layers of the PM6:Y6 BHJ morphology, which are estimated to be less than 5 wt% of the PM6:Y6/Al blend. By comparison, the Ag atoms do not adversely affect PM6:Y6 BHJ morphology and the associated device physics. The investigation of reactive electrode‐BHJ interfaces by multiscale characterization techniques and device physics is expected to provide guidance to future interfacial engineering strategies to develop stable and efficient OPVs."
7,10.1021/acsami.3c02071,2023.0,Improving the Stability of Non-fullerene-Based Organic Photovoltaics through Sequential Deposition and Utilization of a Quasi-orthogonal Solvent.,"The development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has led to a rapid improvement in their efficiency. Despite these improvements, significant performance degradation in the early stages of operation, known as burn-in, remains a challenge for NFA-based OPVs. To address this challenge, this study demonstrates a stable NFA-based OPV fabricated using sequential deposition (SqD) and a quasi-orthogonal solvent. The quasi-orthogonal solvent, which is prepared by incorporating 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) into dichloromethane (DCM), reduces the vapor pressure of the solvent and allows for the efficient dissolution and penetration of the Y6 (one of efficient NFAs) into a PM6 polymer-donor layer without damaging the latter. The resulting bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is characterized by a higher degree of crystallinity in the PM6 domains than that prepared using a conventional single-step deposition (SD) process. The OPV fabricated using the SqD process exhibits a PCE of 14.1% and demonstrates superior thermal stability to the SD-processed OPV. This study conclusively reveals that the formation of a thermally stable interface between the photoactive layer and the electron-transport layer (ETL) is the primary factor contributing to the high thermal stability observed in the SqD-processed OPV."
8,,2019.0,Interfaces in organic photovoltaic devices: understanding the degradation mechanisms and improvement of the stability,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices now regularly reach 10% power conversion efficiency, especially now with the development of non-fullerene acceptors. However, those performances are not always very stable and, in order to improve the lifetime of these devices, a deep understanding of the different degradation mechanisms is needed. Degradation pathways are complex and diverse: they can be induced by numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors which can affect different regions of the device (active materials, interfaces, morphology, etc…). 
In the first part of this presentation, I will specifically focus on the degradation occurring at different interfaces in the multilayer which forms the OPV device. We identified several degradation mechanisms occurring at the bottom interface (ETL/Active layer) as well as at the top interfaces (Active layer/HTL/Electrode). 
In a second part, we studied the potentiality of graftable molecules such as self-assembled monolayers (SAM) to improve the stability of OPV devices. A solution to replace PEDOT:PSS in direct architecture was developed involving a thin layer of P3HT grafted on the ITO. 
These different studies highlight the role of the architecture and, more specifically, of the ETL, HTL and electrode in the stability of OPV devices. They also showed that functionalization of the metal oxides can be a solution to improve the stability of the devices."
9,10.1039/C8TA04098B,2018.0,Influence of perfluorinated ionomer in PEDOT:PSS on the rectification and degradation of organic photovoltaic cells,"Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used to build optoelectronic devices. However, as a hygroscopic water-based acidic material, it brings major concerns for stability and degradation, resulting in an intense effort to replace it in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. In this work, we focus on the perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) polymeric additive to PEDOT:PSS. We demonstrate that it can reduce the relative amplitude of OPV device burn-in, and find two distinct regimes of influence. At low concentrations there is a subtle effect on wetting and work function, for instance, with a detrimental impact on the device characteristics, and above a threshold it changes the electronic and device properties. The abrupt threshold in the conducting polymer occurs for PFI concentrations greater than or equal to the PSS concentration and was revealed by monitoring variations in transmission, topography, work-function, wettability and OPV device characteristics. Below this PFI concentration threshold, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) are impaired largely by low fill-factors due to poor charge extraction. Above the PFI concentration threshold, we recover the PCE before it is improved beyond the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer based OPV devices. Supplementary to the performance enhancement, PFI improves OPV device stability and lifetime. Our degradation study leads to the conclusion that PFI prevents water from diffusing to and from the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer, which slows down the deterioration of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the aluminum electrode. These findings reveal mechanisms and opportunities that should be taken into consideration when developing components to inhibit OPV degradation."
10,10.1002/adfm.202203487,2022.0,Water‐Insensitive Electron Transport and Photoactive Layers for Improved Underwater Stability of Organic Photovoltaics,"Water ingress is one of the major environmental stresses to cause the degradation of device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPVs) and is one of the major barriers impeding their commercialization. This work demonstrates that combining the use of a nanoparticle titanium dioxide (np‐TiO2) electron transporting layer (ETL) and an all‐polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer can endow the derived OPV with a much better water resistivity than the commonly employed zinc oxide (ZnO) ETL or polymer:small molecule BHJ blends. Polymer donors/acceptors are first shown to possess better water‐immersion than the small molecule counterparts. Hence, the all‐polymer blend exhibits the lowest absorbance losses after water immersion among the studied BHJ systems. Furthermore, the result reveals that tailoring the structure of the TiO2 ETL from planar to nanoparticles effectively strengthens the adhesion at the ETL/BHJ interface to prevent physical delamination. Finally, the np‐TiO2/all‐polymer blend (half‐cell) is demonstrated to have superior stability under water immersion, i.e., unchanged morphology and charge carrier transfer, as well as no efficiency changes in the complete cells. This work demonstrates the great potential of the all‐polymer blends and np‐TiO2 ETL for improving the durability of unencapsulated OPVs under high humidity environments and even water immersion."
11,10.3390/coatings12081071,2022.0,The Role of the Electron Transport Layer in the Degradation of Organic Photovoltaic Cells,"The performance of the electron transport layer (ETL) plays a critical role in extending the operational lifespan of organic photovoltaic devices. ZnO is an excellent electron transport layer used in the printable organic photovoltaic cells. A comparison of Ca and ZnO as the ETL in encapsulated bulk heterojunction OPV devices has been undertaken with the device stability dependence on light soaking, temperature, irradiance, and thermal cycling recorded. It was observed that the OPV devices using Ca ETL decayed faster than the ZnO ETL devices under the same light illumination. The degradation in a Ca ETL device is ascribed to the formation of an insulating calcium oxide layer at the ETL interfaces. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed a higher PL signal for the degraded Ca ETL devices compared to the ZnO ETL devices. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the ZnO ETL devices was found to be much more stable than the Ca devices. The PCE for ZnO ETL devices still retained 40% of their initial value while the Ca ETL devices failed completely over the period of 18 days in the study, leading to a clear outcome of the study."
12,10.1002/eem2.12381,2022.0,Non‐Fullerene‐Based Inverted Organic Photovoltaic Device with Long‐Term Stability,"In this work, we developed the PM6:Y6‐based inverted structure organic photovoltaic (i‐OPV) with improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long‐term stability by resolving the origins of the performance deterioration. The deep defects between the metal oxide‐based electron transport layer and bulk‐heterojunction photoactive layer interface were responsible for suboptimal PCE and facilitated degradation of devices. While the density of deep traps is increased during the storage of i‐OPV, the penetrative oxygen‐containing defects additionally generated shallow traps below the band‐edge of Y6, causing an additional loss in the open‐circuit voltage. The suppression of interfacial defects by chemical modification effectively improved the PCE and long‐term stability of i‐OPV. The modified i‐OPV (mi‐OPV) achieved a PCE of 17.42%, which is the highest value among the reported PM6:Y6‐based i‐OPV devices. Moreover, long‐term stability was significantly improved: ~90% and ~80% retention of its initial PCE after 1200 h of air storage and illumination, respectively."
13,10.21926/jept.2203023,2022.0,Surface Treatment of Flexible Barrier Film for Improved Stability of Organic Photovoltaic Mini Modules,"The lifetime and stability of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are the key factors that influence the technology used to scale up and commercialize OPVs. High-performing and reliable devices are used to fabricate the devices of choice. Materials and methods that can be used to prevent the degradation of organic materials, enabling better OPV applications, are being increasingly researched in recent years. Herein, we present the surface modification process of a commercial, flexible barrier film based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET). A sol-gel deposition method was used to modify the surface. Two scalable coating techniques, spray- and bar-coating, were investigated as the processing methods. Treated films were optically, morphologically, and topologically characterized. The modification of the barrier film surface increased the surface hydrophobicity of the bar-coated and spray-coated treated films. This was validated by the contact angle measurements. OPV roll-to-roll (R2R) mini-modules with 4.2% power conversion efficiency were fabricated and encapsulated with the treated films. The lifetime and stability were assessed by conducting accelerated aging tests based on the ISOS-D-3 protocol. The spray-coating technique provided a more stable layer than the bar-coating technique, and the lifetime of the OPV modules encapsulated in spray-coated treated barrier films was increased. Surface modification has been demonstrated to be a promising approach for not only improving the barrier film properties (resulting in the improved lifetimes of the modules) but also reducing the extents of reflectance losses in the OPV modules post encapsulation."
14,10.1002/adfm.202406941,2024.0,Unraveling the Impact of Solution Filtration on Organic Solar Cell Stability,"Despite major advances in efficiency, the operational stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices remains poor. Therefore, understanding the degradation mechanisms and identifying potential solutions to improve device stability is critical to enabling the widespread commercialization of OPVs. Herein, simple filtration of the PBDB‐T:ITIC photoactive layer (PAL) solution prior to film deposition is demonstrated to enhance OPV device operational stability without compromising initial device performance. The effect of filtration, a commonly used but poorly understood OPV fabrication step, is investigated using a range of chemical, structural, and optoelectronic methods, on solutions and films. Filtration is found to remove large aggregates from solution without disrupting nanoscale preaggregation, resulting in enhanced acceptor ordering in PBDB‐T:ITIC thin films, significantly improving morphological stability and photostability. This simple and facile method is confirmed to be a general strategy that also works for other PBDB‐T‐containing OPV blends, including Y6‐based systems, and highlights how subtle changes in morphology can result in dramatic differences in operational stability."
15,10.1002/inf2.12554,2024.0,Revealing processing stability landscape of organic solar cells with automated research platforms and machine learning,"We use an automated research platform combined with machine learning to assess and understand the resilience against air and light during production of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices from over 40 donor and acceptor combinations. The standardized protocol and high reproducibility of the platform results in a dataset of high variety and veracity to deploy machine learning models to encounter links between stability and chemical, energetic, and morphological structure. We find that the strongest predictor for air/light resilience during production is the effective gap Eg,eff which points to singlet oxygen rather than the superoxide anion being the dominant agent in degradation under processing conditions. A similarly good prediction of air/light resilience can also be achieved by considering only features from chemical structure, that is, information which is available prior to any experimentation."
16,10.1021/acsami.4c00056,2024.0,Tuning Surface Defect States in Sputtered Titanium Oxide Electron Transport Layers for Enhanced Stability of Organic Photovoltaics.,"Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have dramatically improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPV) in recent years; however, their device stability currently remains a bottleneck for further technological progress. Photocatalytic decomposition of nonfullerene acceptor molecules at metal oxide electron transport layer (ETL) interfaces has in several recent reports been demonstrated as one of the main degradation mechanisms for these high-performing OPV devices. While some routes for mitigating such degradation effects have been proposed, e.g., through a second layer integrated on the ETL surface, no clear strategy that complies with device scale-up and application requirements has been presented to date. In this work, it is demonstrated that the development of sputtered titanium oxide layers as ETLs in nonfullerene acceptor based OPV can lead to significantly enhanced device lifetimes. This is achieved by tuning the concentration of defect states at the oxide surface, via the reactive sputtering process, to mitigate the photocatalytic decomposition of NFA molecules at the metal oxide interlayers. Reduced defect state formation at the oxide surface is confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies, while the reduced photocatalytic decomposition of nonfullerene acceptor molecules is confirmed via optical spectroscopy investigations. The PBDB-T:ITIC organic solar cells show power conversion efficiencies of around 10% and significantly enhanced photostability. This is achieved through a reactive sputtering process that is fully scalable and industry compatible."

Here, we perform..."
18,10.1021/acsami.1c12321,2021.0,A Multi-modal Approach to Understanding Degradation of Organic Photovoltaic Materials.,"State-of-the-art organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials are composed of complex, chemically diverse polymeric and molecular structures that form highly intricate solid-state interactions, collectively yielding exceptional tunability in performance and aesthetics. These properties are especially attractive for semitransparent power-generating windows or shades in living environments, greenhouses, or other architectural integrations. However, before such a future is realized, a broader and deeper understanding of property stability must be acquired. Stability during operating and environmental conditions is critical, namely, material color steadfastness, optoelectronic performance retention, morphological rigidity, and chemical robustness. To date, no single investigation encompasses all four distinct, yet interconnected, metrics. Here, we present a multimodal strategy that captures a dynamic and interconnected evolution of each property during the course of an accelerated photobleaching experiment. We demonstrate this approach across relevant length scales (from molecular to visual macroscale) using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, microwave conductivity, and time-dependent photobleaching spectroscopies for two high-performance semitransparent OPV blends-PDPP4T:PC60BM and PDPP4T:IEICO-4F, with comparisons to the stabilities of the individual components. We present direct evidence that specific molecular acceptor (fullerene vs nonfullerene) designs and the resulting donor-acceptor interactions lead to distinctly different mechanistic routes that ultimately arrive at what is termed ""OPV degradation."" We directly observe a chemical oxidation of the cyano endcaps of the IEICO-4F that coincides with a morphological change and large loss in photoconductivity while the fullerene acceptor-containing blend demonstrates a significantly greater fraction of oxygen uptake but retains 55% of the photoconductivity. This experimental roadmap provides meaningful guidance for future high-throughput, multimodal studies, benchmarking the sensitivity of the different analytical techniques for assessing stability in printable active layers, independent of complete device architectures."
19,10.1002/admi.202000293,2020.0,Encapsulation Effect on Performance and Stability of Organic Solar Cells,"To increase the lifetime of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices and pass European lifetime standards, some encapsulation systems are often used to limit the exposition to oxygen and humidity of solar cells. Despite this progress, the damages induced by the encapsulation process are scarcely studied in literature. In this article, the consequences of the common roll‐to‐roll and vacuum lamination approaches are investigated and compared. The losses of performances are first followed induced by both the encapsulation itself and in a damp heat ageing. The vacuum lamination seems harmless for the solar cells. However, a significant damage is evidenced, even with a relatively mild roll‐to‐roll encapsulation. The degradation mechanisms are further investigated by complementary imaging characterization tools: photoluminescence/electroluminescence imaging and spectroscopy, laser‐beam‐induced current mapping, and correlated to J(V) curves. The recent advancements in the optoelectronic domain may allow linking cell performance to localized flaws. It appears that, although the processing conditions are rather homogeneous, the resulting degradation ends up with a strong localization feature."
20,10.1002/aenm.201501407,2015.0,Procedures and Practices for Evaluating Thin‐Film Solar Cell Stability,"During the last few decades, and in some cases only the last few years, novel thin‐film photovoltaic (PV) technologies such as dye‐sensitized solar cells (DSSC), organic solar cells (OPV), and, more recently, perovskite‐based solar cells (PSC) have been growing in maturity with respect to device performance and device stability. Together with new material systems, novel device architectures have also been introduced. Both parameters will have an effect on the overall device stability. In order to improve the understanding of degradation effects and how they can be prevented, stress testing under different conditions is commonly applied. By careful combination of stress factors and thorough analysis of photovoltaic parameter decaying curves, an understanding of the underlying degradation pathways can be gained. With the help of standardized and accelerated stress tests, as described in the ISOS‐protocols, statements concerning application lifetimes can finally be made and compared among different labs. Once a photovoltaic technology has proven long lasting durability, the ultimate barrier for entering the commercial market are the IEC tests, taking a deeper look on overall safety and reliability, not only on durability. Here, the most prominent stress tests are reviewed, discussed and extended with respect to learning the most about photovoltaic device stability."
21,10.1002/adfm.201101047,2011.0,Enhanced Structural Stability and Performance Durability of Bulk Heterojunction Photovoltaic Devices Incorporating Metallic Nanoparticles,"Despite the progress on organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance, the photoactive layer degradation during prolonged solar illumination is still a major obstacle. In this work, an approach to mitigate the degradation pathway related to structural/morphological changes of the photoactive layer occurring upon continuous illumination in air is presented. It is shown, for the first time, that the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles in poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6‐6]‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester bulk heterojunction (BHJ) leads to improved structural and morphological properties of the composite BHJ solar cells and to better photovoltaic (PV) stability after long periods of continuous illumination. This is evidenced by an original approach based on joint in‐situ time‐resolved X‐ray and atomic force microscopy monitoring. Besides the structural stability improvement and reduced photodegradation rate, it is shown that the composite blends exhibit superior PV performance compared to the pristine BHJs. It can be postulated that the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles in the BHJ leads to a dual enhancement, a plasmon absorption mediated effect, causing improved initial cell efficiency, and a structural stability effect giving rise to reduced degradation rate upon prolonged illumination. The results are in favor of the exploitation of polymer–nanoparticle composites as a promising approach to mitigate the aging effects in OPVs."
22,10.1063/5.0025622,2020.0,Outdoor performance of organic photovoltaics at two different locations: A comparison of degradation and the effect of condensation,"Tests on organic photovoltaics (OPV) mini modules, fabricated through a R2R process, in air and without hazardous solvents have been conducted in order to compare their outdoor performance, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and Bangor, North Wales, and assess the impact of the latitude and climate of the installation on the power generation and modules' lifetime. The test showed different profiles of degradation for each region and formulation, with a surprisingly faster degradation in Bangor. One of the possible sources of the increased degradation is the greater levels of condensation observed in Bangor. To verify the impact of condensation on the module stability, indoor tests have been conducted to relate the dew point depression to module degradation times. The results show that condensation is a significant stress factor in OPV and should be considered more prominently in reliability studies."
23,10.1039/c9se00811j,2020.0,Thermal degradation related to the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and back electrode of the flexible inverted organic photovoltaic module,"The hole transport layer (HTL) and back electrode play a significant role in the stability of the flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) module. In particular, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), a widely used hole transport material, is known to be associated with many degrading factors in the OPV field. This study highlights the impact of the PEDOT:PSS layer on thermal stability using a thermal acceleration test of flexible OPV modules with the inverted structure of indium tin oxide/ZnO/photoactive layer/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. The results confirm that thermal degradation of the OPV devices depends on heat temperature, in which the OPV performance degrades by a notable decrease in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) as the temperature increases from 65 °C to 85 °C. Moreover, the stability of Voc is enhanced when the PEDOT:PSS layer is thicker and contains polar solvent DMSO as an additive, suggesting that the thermal degradation can correlate with the properties of the PEDOT:PSS layer. In addition, microscopy images of the active layers show that the surface damage is attributed to a residual solvent of the printed Ag electrode, thereby resulting in a thermally induced drop in the short circuit current density (Jsc). More detailed descriptions are presented in this paper, and the results are expected to offer a comprehensive understanding of the thermal degradation mechanism of OPV modules."
24,,2018.0,Optimization of the interfaces of encapsulated OPV devices,"In order to limit the flexible organic photovoltaic devices degradation induced by moisture andoxygen, the solar cells are encapsulated between two gas-barrier films. Despite the importanceof the encapsulation processes and their potential influence on the initial performances as well asduring aging of the devices, they are scarcely described in the literature. Furthermore, severalfield aging studies showed that mechanical degradation could limit the devices lifetime beforetheir photo-chemical stability became an issue. Thus, adhesion between the different layerscomposing the devices is a critical factor in order to develop flexible OPV devices reliable aftertheir manufacturing and during their use.In this work, two encapsulation protocols were studied: the roll-to-roll lamination of apressure sensitive adhesive and the vacuum lamination of a hotmelt thermoplastic. In order toquantify the adhesion strength of every interface comprised in the samples, the 180° peelingtest mechanical characterization was adapted for and then applied to the flexible devices. Inaddition, non-destructive imaging characterization techniques were developed: the laser-beaminduced-current mapping and the luminescence emission imaging under optical and electricalexcitation. Thank to these techniques, the hypothesis of a mechanical degradation occurringduring the roll-to-roll lamination process was made. Answers allowing for the improvement ofthe interfaces identified as weak were searched for and evaluated with respect to the photovoltaicperformances of the reference devices. The imaging techniques previously developed were alsoapplied along the accelerated aging of encapsulated cells. A mechanism was proposed, whichallows one to explain the localization of the degradation but also the failure type, either opticalor electrical, occurring during each aging step."
25,10.1002/admi.201801763,2019.0,Impact of Initial Bulk‐Heterojunction Morphology on Operational Stability of Polymer:Fullerene Photovoltaic Cells,"Controlling initial bulk‐heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of photoactive layer is critical for device efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. However, its impact on performance, specifically long‐term operational stability is still poorly understood. This is mainly due to limitations in direct measurements enabling in situ monitoring of devices at a molecular level. Here, a thermal annealing preconditioning step is utilized to tune initial morphology of model polymer:fullerene BHJ OPV devices and molecular resonant vibrational spectroscopy to identify in situ degradation pathways. Direct spectroscopic evidence is reported for molecular‐scale phase‐segregation temperature (TPS) which critically determines a boundary in high efficiency and long operational stability. Under operation, initially well‐mixed blend morphology (no annealing) shows interface instability related to the hole‐extracting layer via de‐doping. Likewise, initially phase‐segregated morphology at a molecular level (annealed above TPS) shows instability in the photoactive layer via continuous phase‐segregation between polymer and fullerenes in macroscales, coupled with further fullerene photodegradation. The results confirm that a thermal annealing preconditioning step is essential to stabilize the BHJ morphology; in particular annealing below TPS is critical for improved operational stability while maintaining high efficiency."

The understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that reduce the power conversion efficiency (PCE) over time is beneficial for the design of new materials with enhanced stability. This paper focuses on bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on thieno [3,4‐b] thiophene‐alt‐benzodithiophene (PTB7) mixed with [6,6]‐phenyl‐C71‐butyric acid methyl esther ([70]PCBM). In spite of being promising in terms of PCE, devices based on this blend are unstable and have a short lifetime. When exposed to light in inert atmosphere, the PCE drops by 15% in less than 1 h and by 35% in 8 h; this degradation is induced by the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum. This paper analyzes the effect induced by UV light on the transport of charges in PTB7:[70]PCBM. Contrary to expectations, the electron transport shows evidence of trapping, while the transport of holes appears unaffected. Furthermore, it is proven that the loss of PCE is due to a reaction between PTB7 and [70]PCBM, while the intrinsic instability of the polymer plays a marginal role."

It is well known that light exposure induces color changes in MoO3 (photochromism) and the formation of intermolecular bonds between C60 molecules (photopolymerization). The influence of these photoinduced reactions on the long‐term stability of OPV cells, however, has not previously been studied in detail. Here, a study and discussion of the early (<5 days) aging mechanisms occurring in illuminated ITO/MoO3/organic cyanine dye/C60/Alq3/Ag bilayer solar cells under nitrogen atmosphere is presented. A degradation process at the organic heterojunction is identified and the formation of Mo5+ species during illumination is found to adversely affect cell behavior. For these widely used materials, the results suggest that light processing is a first necessary step before OPV characteristics can be meaningfully rated."

This article reviews the OPV development highlights of the last two decades, and summarizes the key milestones that have brought the technology to today’s efficiency performance of over 7%. An outlook is presented on what will be required to drive this young photovoltaic technology towards the next major milestone, a 10% power conversion efficiency, considered by many to represent the efficiency at which OPV can be adopted in wide‐spread applications. With first products already entering the market, sufficient lifetime for the intended application becomes more and more critical, and the status of OPV stability as well as the current understanding of degradation mechanisms will be reviewed in the second part of this article."

Here, various deposition methods for back electrodes and materials of HTLs are examined by applying to inverted organic solar cells with a structure of indium tin oxide/ZnO/photoactive layer/poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/Ag. The experiment is performed on encapsulated modules with flexible barrier films under accelerated conditions. The OPV modules with screen‐printed Ag electrodes are shown to be electrically unstable with a reduction of the current density under damp heat condition at 85 °C/85% RH. Optical images for the active layer/PEDOT:PSS interface reveal that a reaction between the solvent from the Ag electrode and the underlying layers is the major cause for the degradation. In comparison with materials of the HTLs, the PEDOT:PSS layer shows low stability compared to the MoO3 layer under the accelerated conditions. Unusual chemical changes in the PEDOT:PSS film are observed through X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and this is further addressed by correlating the stability of the OPV devices."

The presence of moisture and oxygen in conjugated polymer matrix is the major factors responsible for the degradation of organic molecules. The chemical degradation of OPV cell generally depends on the nature of the semiconductor polymer used in the preparation of the devices. However, the lifespan of unprotected OPV cells often ranges in the order of few hours in simple laboratory environment. We are reporting here the lifetime of organic photovoltaic cell in ambient laboratory condition whose active layer is composed of PTB7:PCBM blend."

The synthesis, material, and optical characterisation of the AgPOP with PTB7 are reported. This material was applied to the OPV light-incident surface without the need for a host polymer. The luminescent down shifting layer serves two purposes. Firstly it improves the photocurrent of the OPV, and thus the efficiency through enhancement of the UV spectral response of the device. This is corroborated by external quantum efficiency data showing enhanced performance at UV wavelengths. Secondly, the AgPOP layer reduces the effect of degradation that originates from UV exposure, which leads to enhanced lifetime."

Active layer films are analyzed by AFM, nanomechanical mapping, UV–vis spectroscopy, and XRD. Devices prepared with isopropanol solvent vapor annealing (SVA) combined with thermal annealing (TA) show the highest environmental resistance and performance. Such devices yield average PCE of 3.3%, with stability to atmospheric exposure of up to 60 min prior to encapsulation. Encapsulated devices exposed to the laboratory environment for 30 days exhibit a decrease in PCE of ∼15%. On application of a second TA step PCE is recovered to over 90% of the original value. The unprecedented air stability of the cells is attributed to the formation of an active layer with a stable, favorable morphology during the SVA process, which is associated with lower oxygen content films. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33,10.1002/admi.201300082,2014.0,Suppression of Time‐Dependent Donor/Acceptor Interface Degradation by Redistributing Donor Charge Density,"Poor operation stability is a major hurdle for the wide application of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. While most attention is given to environmental threats to device stability, we herein show evidence from X‐ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) of an intrinsic time‐dependent chemical reaction at a donor/acceptor interface. Albeit with impressive device performance from boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)/fullerene (C60) interface, the forming boride bonds at its interface hinders the interfacial exciton dissociation and leads to device deterioration. Due to the high electron affinity of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) film, the incorporation of MoO3 layer under the SubPc film has strong electron‐drawing property and leads to charge‐transfer complex (CTC) formation at the MoO3/SubPc interface. The resulting charge redistribution in SubPc molecules effectively suppresses the further interfacial reaction at SubPc/C60 junction. Our results provide insight for new degradation mechanisms of OPV devices and corresponding stability control via charge redistribution in the donor film."
34,10.1002/smll.202305437,2023.0,Ultra-Stable ITO-Free Organic Solar Cells and Modules Processed from Non-Halogenated Solvents under Indoor Illumination.,"Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) is a very promising technology to harvest artificial illumination and power smart devices of the Internet of Things (IoT). Efficiencies as high as 30.2% have been reported for OPVs under warm white light-emitting diode (LED) light. This is due to the narrow spectrum of indoor light, which leads to an optimal bandgap of ≈1.9 eV. Under full sunlight, OPV devices often suffer from poor stability compared to the established inorganic PV technologies such as crystalline silicon. This study focuses on a potentially very cost-effective Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) free cell stack with absorber materials processed from non-halogenated solvents. These organic solar cells and modules with efficiencies up to 21% can already achieve remarkable stabilities under typical indoor illumination. Aging under 50,000 lux LED lighting leads to very little degradation after more than 11 000 h. This light dose corresponds to more than 110 years under 500 lux. For modules encapsulated with a flexible barrier, extrapolated lifetimes of more than 41 years are achieved. This shows that OPV is mature for the specific application under indoor illumination. Due to the large number of potential organic semiconducting materials, further efficiency increase can be expected."

In order to probe the degradation mechanism in a donor–acceptor polymer PDPP-TNT: PC71BM bulk heterojunction based OPV devices, we have studied current density–voltage (J–V) behavior and impedance spectroscopy of fresh and aged devices. The current–voltage characteristic of optimized fresh devices exhibit a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.9 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, fill factor (FF) of 54.6%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%. For aged devices, Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE were reduced to 57.3%, 89.8%, 44.3% and 23.7% of its initial value, respectively. The impedance spectra measured under illumination for these devices were successfully fitted using a CPE-based circuit model. For aged devices, the low-frequency response in impedance spectra suggests an accumulation of the photo-generated charge carriers at the interfaces which leads to a significant lowering in fill factor. Such degradation in device performance is attributed to the incorporation of oxygen and water molecules in devices. An increase in the recombination resistance indicates a deterioration of free charge carrier generation and conduction in devices."
36,10.1002/SMTD.201600007,2017.0,Charge Accumulation Spectroscopy for Investigating Organic Photovoltaic Stability,"In order to better understand the degradation mechanisms of inverted organic photovoltaics (OPV), a recently developed spectroscopic technique, charge accumulation spectroscopy, is applied. First, the application of this high-resolution optical spectroscopy technique to OPV devices is demonstrated by detecting the polaronic absorption in a PTB7 (polythienothiophene derivative):PC70BM inverted OPV device and then the technique is used to investigate in situ device operational stability. The device instabilities are identified under operational conditions in vacuum leading to significant losses in open-circuit voltage and fill factor (20% and 10%, respectively, after 80 h of white-light exposure in vacuum), which are correlated to an interfacial charge-transfer mechanism between the metal oxide and photoactive layers. It is suggested that under these conditions 0.2% of the PC70BM molecules become anions due to charge transfer from a highly doped ZnSrO layer leading to device degradation due to enhanced trap-assisted recombination."

Minor addition of SEBS (1 mg/ml in host solution) provides a significantly enhanced T80 value of 15000 hours (extrapolated), surpassing doping-free (0 mg/ml) and heavy doping (10 mg/ml) counterparts (900 hours, 30 hours). The material reproducibility and cost-effectiveness of the active layer will not be affected by this industrially available polymer, where the power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be well maintained at 15.02%, which is still a decent value for non-halogen solvent-treated ASM OPV. Morphological and photophysical characterizations clearly demonstrate SEBS's pivotal effect on suppressing the degradation of donor molecules and blend film's crystallization/aggregation reorganization, which protects the exciton dynamics effectively. This work pays meaningful attention to the ASM system stability, performs a smart strategy to suppress the film morphology degradation, and releases a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of device performance reduction."

For this purpose, the stability enhancement of bulk heterojunction OPV devices upon embedding surfactant free Au nanoparticles (NPs) into the photoactive layer is investigated by in situ time-resolved energy dispersive X-ray reflectometry (EDXR), photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy as well as device degradation electrical measurements. It is shown that besides the improved cell efficiency attributed to plasmon absorption and scattering effects, the embedded NPs act as performance stabilizers, giving rise to enhanced structural stability and, in turn, to reduced photodegradation rate of the respective OPV devices. It is particularly clarified that, in addition to further stabilization of the polymer-fullerene blend, the observed improvement can be ascribed to a NP-mediated mitigation of the photooxidation effect at the cathode-active layer interface. Our work suggests the exploitation of surfactant free NPs to be a successful approach to address aging effects in OPV devices."
39,,2017.0,Outdoor stability studies in Organic Photovoltaics,"This thesis focuses on the outdoor monitoring of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with the aim of improving the stability and performance of OPVs under real world conditions. This is important as in order for OPVs to become commercially viable they must make the transition from small laboratory cells to larger modules. 
Over the course of several outdoor monitoring campaigns various types of OPV modules have been benchmarked against a number of other technologies: polycrystalline silicon, cadmium indium diselenide and dye sensitised solar cells. The principal performance parameters are examined in detail, analysing their dependence on irradiance and temperature. OPVs were shown to have positive temperature coefficients for efficiency, ISC and fill factor and a negative temperature coefficient for VOC. One of the main causes of degradation is ingress of water and oxygen into the module and subsequent photo-oxidation of the active layer and it was shown that UV filtering would improve stability. 
To improve the yield of OPVs outdoors, modules were laminated to different corrugated substrates and subjected to indoor characterisation and outdoor monitoring. The corrugated modules were shown to have three advantages: the effective area of the module, allowing for curvature, is reduced which leads to an improvement in the power conversion efficiency per unit area; substantial enhancement at high angles of incidence led to increased output during early morning and evening; under diffuse irradiance performance improved by up to 25%. Outdoor measurements on larger module strips showed that corrugated strips outperformed flat strips by 7.5% with a 14.8% enhancement under diffuse conditions. 
An alternative technique to improve the yield of OPVs is the use of luminescent down-shifting coatings which were investigated as alternatives to UV filters and have the added benefit of improving stability. The use of both discrete and multiple-dye blends dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate) led to improvements in performance of up to 8% and a six-fold extension of operational lifetime. Dyes were systematically selected by examining their absorption and photoluminescence spectra and matching these to the spectral performance of P3HT:PC61BM OPV devices. In doing so optimised multiple-dye blends were made possible."
40,,2017.0,99Analysis of Degradation Mechanisms in Donor-Acceptor Copolymer Based Organic Photovoltaic Devices Using Impedance Spectroscopy,"The stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices in ambient conditions has been a serious issue which needs to be addressed and resolved timely. In order to probe the degradation mechanism in a donor-acceptor block copolymer PDPP-TNT:PC71BM bulk heterojunction based OPV devices, we have studied current-voltage (J-V) behaviour and impedance spectroscopy (IS) of fresh and aged devices. The current-voltage characteristic of optimized fresh devices exhibit a short circuit current ( J sc ) of 8.9 mA/cm 2 , open circuit voltage ( V oc ) of 0.79 V, fill factor ( FF ) of 54.6 %, and power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) of 3.8 %. For aged devices, J sc , V oc , FF, and PCE was reduced to 42 %, 10 %, 56% and 76% of its initial value, respectively. The impedance spectra measured under illumination for these devices was successfully fitted using a CPE based circuit model. For aged devices, the low frequency response in impedance spectra suggests an accumulation of the photo-generated charge carriers at the interfaces which impedes the charge extraction at the electrodes and leads to a significant lowering in fill factor. Such degradation in device performance is attributed to the incorporation of oxygen and water molecules in devices. An increase in the recombination resistance associated with the bulk heterojunction active layer indicates a deterioration of free charge carrier generation and conduction in devices. Such observations from impedance measurement appear as an electrical signature of the probable physical mechanisms responsible for degradation of OPV devices."
41,10.1149/ma2024-01241405mtgabs,2024.0,Surface Modification of Cellulose Films By Dielectric Barrier Discharge for Organic Photovoltaics Encapsulation,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are the third generation of solar cells and are more and more attractive for industrial applications. OPV present numerous advantages, such as flexibility, low cost, light weight, large-area production.[1,2] Nonetheless, OPV are not as efficient as the conventional crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells. Recently, power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 18% for OPV, while conventional PV remains around 30% [3]. In this sense, additional works are necessary to improve their processability. Moreover, components of OPV are highly sensitive to water or oxygen, which strongly affect OPV stability in time when used in harsh conditions. Therefore, development of new barrier coatings are today essential to reduce OPV degradation and increase their shelf life. According to the literature, encapsulation can be performed following three strategies: (i) glass-glass encapsulation, (ii) flexible polymer lamination and (iii) thin film direct deposition. Glass-glass encapsulation provides great protection, with good optical properties but it remains fragile and is not compatible with roll-to-roll processes. On the other hand, although, flexible polymer lamination is suitable for roll-to-roll processes, adhesion between the front and back barriers is still complex to deal with, leading sometimes to partial encapsulation, thus increasing OPV degradation. Finally, direct deposition allows to obtain thin films with excellent optical and oxygen and humidity barrier properties. To date, most of thin layers are synthesized under vacuum [1,2]. This work focus on the development new barrier coatings at atmospheric pressure, compatible with roll-to-roll processes using cellulose nanofibrils with excellent oxygen barrier properties [4]. Being hydrophilic, the surface of cellulose nanofibrils have been modified to improve the water barrier properties. Wettability modification (WCA ~ 140°) was successfully achieved with an atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge to control the fragmentation/reticulation of 2,4,6,8-Tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS).

While significant progress has been achieved on the power conversion efficiency of OPV technologies, their field stability is rarely studied. This work investigates the field performance and reliability of a large‐area OPV module designed for building integration in tropical Singapore for 4.5 years. The device suffered more than 14% degradation in power at the standard testing conditions from the initial performance, largely due to losses in fill factor (−12% relative). During the monitoring period, it exhibited comparable performance to more conventional silicon PV technologies, with an average specific energy yield of about 4 kWh/kWp/day and an average performance ratio of 0.96. Excellent performance at low light conditions was also observed. However, its field performance was heavily impacted by soiling, which typically led to a 5 to 10% loss in the current output after several months. Further, the device's outdoor performance also showed a three‐stage degradation process, including (1) an initial slow degradation in the first 2 years (about −1%/year), (2) a stable period with negligible performance loss from Years 2 to 3.5, and (3) a rapid degradation in the last year (about −5%/year)."
43,10.1002/smtd.202400345,2024.0,Aqueous PEIE Soaking on ZnO for Ultraviolet Light Activation-Free Organic Photovoltaic Modules.,"Ultraviolet (UV) light is typically needed to activate inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with zinc oxide (ZnO) as electron transporting layer (ETL) for higher efficiency. However, UV light is a major cause for the degradation of organic active layers in OPVs. This is a contradiction that UV light activation enhances the efficiency but UV illumination deteriorates the stability. It is important to solve this contradiction to develop UV light activation-free OPV devices. Herein, a method of aqueous polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) soaking on ZnO is reported to realize UV light activation-free OPV devices. The S-shape in current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of devices tested without UV light activation is eliminated through the treatment of aqueous PEIE soaking on ZnO. The treatment reduces the oxygen adsorbates, which is confirmed by Kelvin probe and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A 10.08 cm2 organic photovoltaic module with the treated ZnO as ETL showed high photovoltaic performance: VOC = 5.68 V, JSC = 2.7 mA cm-2, FF = 75.1%, and POutput = 11.5 mW cm-2 tested with the UV filter (light intensity of 0.788 sun). UV light activation is not needed for the modules to obtain high efficiency."
44,10.1002/cjce.25487,2024.0,Effect of pre‐aging intermediate layers on the performance of multi‐layer organic photovoltaic devices,"Understanding the degradation behaviour of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is an essential part to improve their stability prior to massive production. Accelerated aging can help to assess their stability and study the underlying degradation mechanisms of OPVs. Most studies focus on individual layers or a full device, and little is known about the role a pre‐aged layer stack plays in the performance of a device. Herein, we report the investigation of the effects of pre‐aging of multiple layers on the performance of OPVs. Instead of aging a single layer or an entire stack (sequential layers: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MoOx/F‐BsubPc/C60/BCP/Ag), our process involved aging the intermediate layer stack for 24 h after depositing a specific layer before continuing with the subsequent depositions to fully fabricate/manufacture OPVs. Aging was conducted under four controlled conditions considering parameters including moisture, gas type, and temperature in the absence of light according to the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols. Short of PEDOT:PSS we found that multiple layers, being subjected to the parameters, resulted in a decline in OPV device performance after being fully manufactured. Device performance is evaluated based on short‐circuit current density (Jsc), power conversion efficiency (PCE), and open‐circuit voltage (Voc). Our analysis provides insight into the degradation mechanisms of layered/planar OPV structures and offers strategic guidance for optimizing fabrication processes, particularly during the layer deposition transitions. We recommend that during OPV vacuum deposited fabrication, intermediate layers should be protected from moisture, O2, high temperature, and even inert gases, preferably in a low‐vacuum environment."
45,10.1002/aenm.202101383,2021.0,A Review on Emerging Barrier Materials and Encapsulation Strategies for Flexible Perovskite and Organic Photovoltaics,"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have undergone rapid development within the last decade, exhibiting exciting properties such as high efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for large‐scale fabrication through roll‐to‐roll (R2R) processing. Despite this, operational stability is recognized to be an ongoing challenge as prolonged device lifetimes are scarcely observed. This instability can be narrowed down to both “intrinsic degradation” and “extrinsic degradation,” with exposure to moisture and oxygen having detrimental effects on device performance. A means of delaying the degradation of flexible PSC and OPV devices is through barrier encapsulation. Despite glass encapsulation exhibiting ideal barrier properties, the potential for flexible devices and high‐throughput R2R fabrication requires the development of flexible barrier materials and encapsulation strategies. These barriers must demonstrate outstanding moisture permeation resistance, high transparency, chemical and thermal stability, and must be able to withstand repeated mechanical deformation. Herein, the fundamental principles of PSC and OPV devices are initially discussed, highlighting the degradation mechanisms and current stability obstacles. A review of the latest flexible barrier materials and encapsulation strategies follows, introducing stability studies that have been undertaken on flexible PSCs and OPV, along with suggestions as to the direction that future research may take."
46,10.1039/C3TA01229H,2013.0,Marked improvement in the stability of small molecule organic photovoltaics by interfacial modification using self-assembled monolayers to prevent indium diffusion into the active layer,"This work describes a simple process to improve the stability of small molecule organic photovoltaics (OPVs) that use poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL), without reducing the power conversion efficiency (PCE). We investigated the effect of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the degradation of electrical properties caused by the diffusion of indium through the matrix commonly used in OPV devices. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiles suggested that the acidic PEDOT:PSS etched the indium from the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, which resulted in indium diffusion into and chemical interaction with the active layer. Such behavior was responsible for the deterioration of the device. By inserting a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with carboxylic acid functional groups at the interface between the ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers, such diffusion could be significantly suppressed. The PCE of the pristine OPV diminished to zero at 49 days post-fabrication under ambient conditions. However, the PCE of the SAM-modified device was reduced by only 30% over the same period, and only to 48% after 98 days. Moreover, the SAMs improved the interfacial electrical properties between the ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers, which maintained the PCE of the device. Our findings suggest a simple approach to improve the stability of OPVs that utilize PEDOT:PSS as the HTL."
47,10.1002/MACP.201300076,2013.0,Advanced Functional Polymers for Increasing the Stability of Organic Photovoltaics,"The development of new advanced polymers for improving the stability of OPV is reviewed. Two main degradation pathways for the OPV active layer are identified: photochemically initiated reactions primarily starting in the side chains and morphological changes that degrade the important nanostructure. Chemical units can be introduced that impart an increased stability. Similarly, the morphological degradation of the optimal nanostructure can be reduced. Active polymers and blends with acceptor material are used to create nanoparticle links with controlled size. Most of these advanced polymers and processing methods have only been utilized in small-scale devices prepared by standard techniques such as spin coating, but a few cases of roll-to-roll processed solar cells with heat-cleaved side chains are discussed."
48,10.7454/MSS.V19I3.4849,2015.0,Application of Equivalent Circuit Models to Monitor the Degradation of Organic Photovoltaic Cells,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have lower efficiency, shorter lifetimes, faster degradation, and poorer stability than inorganic photovoltaics (IPV) in ambient conditions. In this paper, the equivalent electrical circuit of a two-diode model effectively extracts the model-fit electrical photovoltaic (PV) parameters from degraded OPV devices, especially the series (R s ) and shunt (R sh ) resistances. The result shows a better correlation between the resistances of the devices and performance of the devices over the degradation process where the devices are deliberately exposed to ambient conditions under constant illumination. The degradation of the devices is mostly caused by the degradation of the aluminum (Al) electrode from water and oxygen, which correlates to the R s . However, it is possible that the degradation of the bulk active layer can also occur due to the constant illumination on the device, which causes a reduction of photocurrent."
49,10.1117/12.2186998,2015.0,Predicting thermal stability of organic solar cells through real-time capacitive techniques (Presentation Recording),"Bulk Heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have reached Power Conversion Efficiencies (PCE) over 10% but to be a competitive product long lifetimes are mandatory. In this view, guidelines for the prediction and optimization of the device stability are crucial to generate improved materials for efficient and stable BHJ devices. For encapsulated cells, degradation mechanisms can be mainly ascribed to external agents such as light and temperature. In particular, thermal degradation appears to be related not only to the BHJ morphology but also to the adjacent interfaces. Therefore, in order to have a complete description of the thermal stability of a BHJ cell, it is necessary to consider the entire stack degradation processes by using techniques enabling a direct investigation on working devices. Here, five different donor polymers were selected and the OPV performance of the corresponding BHJ devices were monitored during the thermal degradation at 85°C, showing an exponential decay of the corresponding PCEs. In parallel, we measured the geometrical capacitance of analogous OPV devices as a function of temperature and we observed that at a defined temperature (TMAX), typical for each polymer-based device, the capacitance starts to decrease. Combining all these results we found an evident and direct correlation between TMAX and the PCE decay parameters (obtained from capacitance-temperature an thermal measurements, respectively). This implies that the capacitance-method here presented is a fast, reliable and relatively simple method to predict the thermal stability of BHJ solar cells without the need to perform time-consuming thermal degradation tests."
50,10.1039/c2cp40821j,2012.0,On the stability of a variety of organic photovoltaic devices by IPCE and in situ IPCE analyses--the ISOS-3 inter-laboratory collaboration.,"This work is part of the inter-laboratory collaboration to study the stability of seven distinct sets of state-of-the-art organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices prepared by leading research laboratories. All devices have been shipped to and degraded at RISØ-DTU up to 1830 hours in accordance with established ISOS-3 protocols under defined illumination conditions. In this work, we apply the Incident Photon-to-Electron Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) and the in situ IPCE techniques to determine the relation between solar cell performance and solar cell stability. Different ageing conditions were considered: accelerated full sun simulation, low level indoor fluorescent lighting and dark storage. The devices were also monitored under conditions of ambient and inert (N(2)) atmospheres, which allows for the identification of the solar cell materials more susceptible to degradation by ambient air (oxygen and moisture). The different OPVs configurations permitted the study of the intrinsic stability of the devices depending on: two different ITO-replacement alternatives, two different hole extraction layers (PEDOT:PSS and MoO(3)), and two different P3HT-based polymers. The response of un-encapsulated devices to ambient atmosphere offered insight into the importance of moisture in solar cell performance. Our results demonstrate that the IPCE and the in situ IPCE techniques are valuable analytical methods to understand device degradation and solar cell lifetime."
51,10.1039/c2cp41787a,2012.0,TOF-SIMS investigation of degradation pathways occurring in a variety of organic photovoltaic devices--the ISOS-3 inter-laboratory collaboration.,"The present work is the fourth (and final) contribution to an inter-laboratory collaboration that was planned at the 3rd International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS-3). The collaboration involved six laboratories capable of producing seven distinct sets of OPV devices that were degraded under well-defined conditions in accordance with the ISOS-3 protocols. The degradation experiments lasted up to 1830 hours and involved more than 300 cells on more than 100 devices. The devices were analyzed and characterized at different points of their lifetimes by a large number of non-destructive and destructive techniques in order to identify specific degradation mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of the photovoltaic response. Work presented herein involves time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in order to study chemical degradation in-plane as well as in-depth in the organic solar cells. Various degradation mechanisms were investigated and correlated with cell performance. For example, photo-oxidation of the active material was quantitatively studied as a function of cell performance. The large variety of cell architectures used (some with and some without encapsulation) enabled valuable comparisons and important conclusions to be drawn on degradation behaviour. This comprehensive investigation of OPV stability has significantly advanced the understanding of degradation behaviour in OPV devices, which is an important step towards large scale application of organic solar cells."

[ 12–15 ] A comparison of OPV lifetime experimental results across different research groups has posed challenges due to the lack of standardized testing and reporting procedures; however, great strides were made in this regard during the most recent International Summit on OPV Stability (ISOS-3). Modules based on P3HT/fullerene BHJs have shown lifetimes of 5000 h when state-of-the-art encapsulation with a glass-on-glass architecture is used. [ 16 ] Assuming negligible degradation in the dark and 5.5 h of one-sun intensity per day, 365 days per year, this translates into an operating lifetime approaching three years. More recently P3HT/PCBM devices utilizing an inverted architecture have been shown to retain more than 50% of their initial effi ciency after 4700 h of continuous exposure to one-sun intensity at elevated temperatures [ 17 ] and have exhibited a long shelf-life when stored in the dark in ambient conditions.

53,10.1063/1.4826586,2013.0,Multiple-interface tracking of degradation process in organic photovoltaics,"The investigation of the stability in organic photovoltaics has been focused on individual components via localized and destructive analysis, which is limited to broken devices, instead of an operational OPV, and unable to obtain correlated information of degrading interfaces. DC biased AC impedance spectroscopy is employed here, to track multi-interface degradation without breaking the device. By varying DC bias, individual interface degradation is revealed via current density and capacitance versus voltage plots. While one of the impedance semicircles is linked to the interface of P3HT:PCBM, the other represented the interface between the mixture and metal electrode, involving metal oxide in an aged device. The results confirm that, more than one degradation process take place simultaneously at individual interfaces."
54,10.1073/pnas.1801187115,2018.0,"Thermally stable, highly efficient, ultraflexible organic photovoltaics","Significance We have developed an ultraflexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) that achieves sufficient thermal stability of up to 120 °C and a high power conversion efficiency of 10% with a total thickness of 3 μm. By combining an inherently stable donor:acceptor blend as the active layer and ultrathin substrate and barriers with excellent thermal capability, we were able to overcome the trade-offs between efficiency, stability, and device thickness. The ultraflexible and thermally stable OPV can be easily integrated into textiles through the commercially available hot-melt process without causing performance degradation, thereby presenting great potential as a ubiquitous and wearable power source in daily life. Flexible photovoltaics with extreme mechanical compliance present appealing possibilities to power Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and wearable electronic devices. Although improvement in thermal stability is essential, simultaneous achievement of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability in flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) remains challenging due to the difficulties in maintaining an optimal microstructure of the active layer under thermal stress. The insufficient thermal capability of a plastic substrate and the environmental influences cannot be fully expelled by ultrathin barrier coatings. Here, we have successfully fabricated ultraflexible OPVs with initial efficiencies of up to 10% that can endure temperatures of over 100 °C, maintaining 80% of the initial efficiency under accelerated testing conditions for over 500 hours in air. Particularly, we introduce a low-bandgap poly(benzodithiophene-cothieno[3,4-b]thiophene) (PBDTTT) donor polymer that forms a sturdy microstructure when blended with a fullerene acceptor. We demonstrate a feasible way to adhere ultraflexible OPVs onto textiles through a hot-melt process without causing severe performance degradation."

While signiﬁcant progress has been achieved on the power conversion eﬃciency of OPV technologies, their ﬁeld stability is rarely studied. This work investigates the ﬁeld performance and reliability of a large-area OPV module designed for BIPV application in the tropical region of Singapore for 4.5 years. The device suﬀered more than 14% degradation in power at the standard testing conditions from the initial performance, largely due to losses in ﬁll factor (-12% relative). During the monitoring period, it exhibited comparable performance to more conventional silicon PV technologies, with an average speciﬁc energy yield of about 4 kWh/kWp/day and an average performance ratio of 0.96. Excellent performance at low light conditions was also observed. However, its ﬁeld performance was heavily impacted by soiling, which typically led to a 5 to 10% loss in the current output after several months. Further, the device’s outdoor performance also showed a three-stage degradation process, including (1) an initial slow degradation in the ﬁrst two years (about -1%/year), (2) a stable period with negligible performance loss from year 2 to year 3.5 and (3) a rapid degradation in the last year (about -5%/year)."
56,10.1002/advs.201800434,2018.0,Current Status of Outdoor Lifetime Testing of Organic Photovoltaics,"Performance degradation is one of the key obstacles limiting the commercial application of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The assessment of OPV stability and lifetime are usually based on simulated degradation experiments conducted under indoor conditions, whereas photovoltaic devices experience different environmental conditions under outdoor operation. Besides the intrinsic degradation of OPV devices due to the evolution of optoelectronic and morphological structure during long‐term operation, outdoor environmental changes can impose extra stresses and accelerate the degradation of OPV modules. Although outdoor studies on long‐term OPV stability are restricted by the long data collection times, they provide direct information on OPV stability under mixed degradation stresses and are therefore invaluable from the point of view of both research and practical application. Here, an overview of the current status of outdoor lifetime studies of OPVs is provided. After a summary of device lifetime extrapolated from indoor studies, outdoor lifetime testing platforms are introduced and the operational lifetime of various OPV devices are reviewed. The influence of climate and weather parameters on device performance and burn‐in phenomena observed during the degradation of OPVs is then discussed. Finally, an outlook and directions for future research in this field are suggested."

By using a metal doped organic exciton blocking layer (EBL), enhanced stability is demonstrated in unpackaged CuPc/C60 organic photovoltaic devices (OPV). While devices with a pure organic EBL of bathocuproine and tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) show over ∼20% decreases in efficiency for first 150 min of operation, the device with magnesium-doped Alq3 EBL shows less than ∼5% variation in efficiency during the same period."

We show that as the device is exposed to a flux of 15-MV X-rays, the recorded photocurrent undergoes a near exponential decay described by two decay constants of 1.6×10-4 and 1.8×10-3 Gy-1. In order to understand the degradation mechanisms of the device, we expose the constituent parts to a significant dose (~4.2 kGy) of 15-MV X-rays and record changes in the photoluminescence and absorption spectra of the P3HT, and also explore the current-voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency of the OPVs. We use our results to comment on the induced degradation mechanisms resulting from the exposure to X-rays."
59,10.25777/BGBX-EY61,2013.0,Improving the stability of high and low bandgap polymers organic photovoltaic devices using a solution based titanium sub-oxide interfacial layer,"IMPROVING THE STABILITY OF HIGH AND LOW BANDGAP POLYMERS ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICES USING A SOLUTION BASED TITANIUM SUB-OXIDE INTERFACIAL LAYER Kumiawan Foe Old Dominion University, 2013 Director: Dr. Gon Namkoong The improvement in device efficiency has brought organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices closer to commercial viability, highlighting the importance of studying the lifetime and stability of OPV devices. At present, the lifetime and stability of OPV devices is much shorter and poor mainly caused by oxygen, moisture, and light resulting in the oxidation on low work function electrodes and the degradation of the morphology of the photoactive layer. To improve the lifetime and stability of the OPV devices, we used newly developed low bandgap polymer, PCDTBT, as the electron acceptor material and a solution based titanium sub-oxide (TiOx) interfacial layer inserted between the active layer and the cathode. In our experiment, we fabricated unencapsulated bulk heterojunctions OPV devices based on the high and low bandgap polymers of P3HT:PC61BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM, respectively. We synthesized a solution based TiOx by using a sol-gel chemistry method. We performed stability tests on the OPV devices: (1) with and without the TiOx layer (Case (I)) to test the effectiveness of the TiOx layer in protecting the photoactive layer from degradation, (2) with and without a protection cover (a high research grade opaque A1 foil) to observe the device performance in a dark/light environment (Case (II)), and (3) in different storage media conditions: (a) air, (b) glove box, (3) ante-chamber of a glove box, and (4) (Case (III)). We spent significant time and effort in optimizing the fabrication processing steps including; the thickness of the active layer, pre-annealing and post-annealing treatments. We fabricated the OPV devices by using the optimal fabrication procedure. We found that the best PCE value of 4.1% achieved for the P3HT:PC61BM OPV cell and 5.1% for the PCDTBT:PC71BM OPV cell. On the air stability test, we found that the OPV cell of P3HT:PC61BM materials showed good air stability performance resulting in the PCE only dropping 26% over a period of 70 days (stored in a glove box). The PCDTBT:PC71BM devices stored in the glove box over a period of 30 days showed relatively good air stability performances; (1) the device with a TiOx layer and an opaque A1 cover the PCE dropped only 16%, (2) the device with the TiOx layer and without an opaque A1 cover PCE dropped 34%, and (3) the device without a TiOx layer and with an A1 cover PCE dropped 48%. While the PCDTBT:PC71BM devices stored in the air; (1-2) with a TiOx layer and with/without opaque A1 covers the PCE values dropped 92% after 18 days, and (3) without the TiOx layer and with an opaque A1 cover, the PCE dropped 100% after 3 days. These results highlight the effectiveness of the TiOx layer in protecting the active layer from degradation. We concluded that the TiOx layer effectively improved the stability the OPV devices. With love and humble admiration, I dedicate this thesis to my God and Savior, Lord Jesus, my wife, Lian, and our children, Joshua, Mieah, and Nehemiah, and to my parents, brothers, and sisters."
60,10.1002/aenm.201901829,2019.0,Study of Burn‐In Loss in Green Solvent‐Processed Ternary Blended Organic Photovoltaics Derived from UV‐Crosslinkable Semiconducting Polymers and Nonfullerene Acceptors,"This work deals with the investigation of burn‐in loss in ternary blended organic photovoltaics (OPVs) prepared from a UV‐crosslinkable semiconducting polymer (P2FBTT‐Br) and a nonfullerene acceptor (IEICO‐4F) via a green solvent process. The synthesized P2FBTT‐Br can be crosslinked by UV irradiation for 150 s and dissolved in 2‐methylanisole due to its asymmetric structure. In OPV performance and burn‐in loss tests performed at 75 °C or AM 1.5G Sun illumination for 90 h, UV‐crosslinked devices with PC71BM show 9.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability against burn‐in loss than pristine devices. The frozen morphology resulting from the crosslinking prevents lateral crystallization and aggregation related to morphological degradation. When IEICO‐4F is introduced in place of a fullerene‐based acceptor, the burn‐in loss due to thermal aging and light soaking is dramatically suppressed because of the frozen morphology and high miscibility of the nonfullerene acceptor (18.7% → 90.8% after 90 h at 75 °C and 37.9% → 77.5% after 90 h at AM 1.5G). The resulting crosslinked device shows 9.4% PCE (9.8% in chlorobenzene), which is the highest value reported to date for crosslinked active materials, in the first green processing approach."
61,10.1021/acsami.9b13085,2019.0,Biomimetic approach to inhibition of photooxidation in organic solar cells using beta-carotene as an additive.,"Recent efficiency records of organic photovoltaics (OPV) highlight stability as a limiting weakness. Incorporation of stabilizers is a desirable approach for inhibiting degradation - it is inexpensive and readily up-scalable. However, to date, such additives have had limited success. We show that beta-carotene (BC), an inexpensive and green, naturally-occurring antioxidant, dramatically improves OPV stability. When compared to non-stabilized reference devices, the accumulated power generation in presence of BC of PTB7:[70]PCBM devices increases by an impressive factor of 6, due to stabilization of both the burn-in and the lifetime, and by a factor of 21 for P3HT:[60]PCBM devices, owing to a longer lifetime. Using electron spin resonance and time-resolved near-IR emission spectroscopies, we probed radical and singlet oxygen concentrations. We demonstrate that singlet oxygen sensitized by [70]PCBM causes the ""burn-in"" of PTB7:[70]PCBM devices, and that BC effectively mitigates it. Our results provide an effective solution to the problem that currently limits widespread use of OPV."

Two particular cases of the degradation are reported.
63,10.1039/D0EE03885G,2021.0,Photogeneration and the bulk quantum efficiency of organic photovoltaics,"We introduce a method to analyze the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) by calculating its “bulk quantum efficiency” (BQE), a quantity related to the recombination losses within the BHJ, but not in the surrounding device layers. By applying the method to both vacuum- and solution-processed OPVs with various BHJ, buffer layers and interface layer compositions, we show that measurements of the BQE isolates the properties of the BHJ from other device layers and interfaces. We use measurements of the BQE to study various mechanisms in OPV degradation and find that for solution-processed OPVs with a ZnO cathode buffer layer, the BHJ undergoes degradation due primarily to the ZnO. By inserting a self-assembled monolayer at the interface between the buffer and the BHJ, the stability of the OPV is significantly improved."

All devices have been shipped to and degraded at the Danish Technical University (DTU, formerly RISO-DTU) up to 1830 hours in accordance with established ISOS-3 protocols under defined illumination conditions. In this work we present a summary of the degradation response observed for the NREL sample, an inverted OPV of the type ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag/Al, under full sun stability test. The results reported from the combination of the different characterization techniques results in a proposed degradation mechanism. The final conclusion is that the failure of the photovoltaic response of the device is mainly due to the degradation of the electrodes and not to the active materials of the solar cell."
65,10.1021/am5024989,2014.0,Long-term stabilization of organic solar cells using hindered phenols as additives.,"We report on the improvement of long-term stability of organic solar cells (OPV) using hindered phenol based antioxidants as stabilizing additives. A set of seven commercially available hindered phenols are investigated for use in bulk-heterojunction OPV. Polymer:fullerene films based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are characterized with respect to the initial power conversion efficiency and the long-term stability improvement under illumination in ambient conditions. FTIR spectroscopy is used to trace chemical degradation over time. OPV performance is recorded under ISOS-3 conditions, and an improved long-term performance of OPV devices, manifested in increased accumulated power generation (APG), is found for octadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate. Using this additive, APG is increased by a factor of 3 compared to the reference. Observed differences in the stabilization of tested additives are discussed in terms of energetic trap states formation within the HOMO/LUMO gap of the photoactive material, morphological changes, and chemical structure."
66,10.1109/PVSC.2008.4922720,2008.0,Short-term metal/organic interface stability investigations of organic photovoltaic devices,"As organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have begun to move toward initial applications, issues of their stability are becoming increasingly important. The de facto standard OPV devices are made from a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and these serve as a test bed for lifetime testing. Delamination, oxidation, and chemical interactions at the metal electrode/organic interface have been posited as degradation pathways in organic electronic devices.[1,2] Here, two short-term experiments were employed to evaluate the stability of this interface in the light and dark. Full devices and unprotected organic surfaces were separately examined, and both were found to be stable in air over the course of 10's of minutes while in the dark. While unprotected devices were stable (less than 20% loss in efficiency) in air for 100 minutes under constant 1-sun illumination, unprotected organic surfaces were not, and good devices could not be made on them subsequently."
67,10.1098/rsta.2014.0320,2015.0,Excitons and the lifetime of organic semiconductor devices,"While excitons are responsible for the many beneficial optical properties of organic semiconductors, their non-radiative recombination within the material can result in material degradation due to the dumping of energy onto localized molecular bonds. This presents a challenge in developing strategies to exploit the benefits of excitons without negatively impacting the device operational stability. Here, we will briefly review the fundamental mechanisms leading to excitonic energy-driven device ageing in two example devices: blue emitting electrophosphorescent organic light emitting devices (PHOLEDs) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. We describe strategies used to minimize or even eliminate this fundamental device degradation pathway."
68,10.1039/d0tc03969a,2020.0,Effects of polymer crystallinity on non-fullerene acceptor based organic solar cell photostability,"While there has been rapid progress made in the performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in recent years, the device stability remains a major bottleneck for commercialization. In this work, we blended a stable acceptor (O-IDTBR) with two photostable donors (PTB7-Th and PffBT4T-2OD) having different polymer crystallinity, and the resulting devices show a significant difference in the OPV degradation rate. The OPV devices employing a highly crystalline polymer PffBT4T-2OD as an active layer show a good resistance against light soaking, maintaining 80% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 100 hours, while the devices employing an amorphous polymer PTB7-Th as an active layer show a significant PCE loss in the initial 20 hours mainly due to a rapid loss of the fill factor. By carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the device degradation mechanisms, we conclude that the origin for the PTB7-Th:O-IDTBR device degradation is the formation of mid-gap states under continuous sunlight illumination, leading to a significant drop in electron mobility. Device simulation revealed that deep traps act as charge recombination centers and increase the trap-assisted recombination rate, lowering the FF and Jsc."
69,10.1088/0022-3727/49/12/125604,2016.0,Long-term stabilization of organic solar cells using UV absorbers,"We are reporting on the successful implementation of UV absorbers for the long-term stabilization of organic photovoltaic devices (OPV). A set of six commercially available representatives of main UV absorber classes, commonly used for insulating plastics, were ternary-blended into the active layer, and the OPV performances were recorded under International Summit on OPV Stability standards (ISOS-3) degradation conditions. An improvement in the long-term performance of the OPV devices, manifested in the accumulated power generation (APG) increase for over a factor of 3, was found for 2-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-5-[(hexyl)oxy]-phenol. This improvement is governed by a significantly decreased PCE loss during the burn-in period. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy, used to trace chemical degradation over time, indicates that the stabilization of the active layer occurs due to a reduced formation of radicals facilitated by the UV screening properties of the additive."
70,10.1002/aenm.201401442,2015.0,Low Substrate Temperature Encapsulation for Flexible Electrodes and Organic Photovoltaics,"Encapsulation is of key importance to improve the stability and lifetime of organic conductors and devices, mainly in applications such as flexible electrodes or organic photovoltaics (OPV). Here, a single‐layer conformal encapsulation method is demonstrated via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) for organic conductor, poly (3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The accelerated degradation tests at 100 °C show that the conductivity of encapsulated PEDOT can be retained up to 17 times longer than that of the unencapsulated counterpart. PEDOT degradation and encapsulation mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, the versatility of the iCVD encapsulation on a top‐illuminated OPV architecture that can be used to produce low‐cost photovoltaics devices on various unconventional substrates (e.g., paper) is demonstrated. Unlike previous approaches of using solely water/oxygen barriers, the encapsulation effect of polymer films on OPV devices is improved by a thin layer capping of evaporated UV‐screening material, Cerium(IV) oxide (CeO2) over the iCVD polymer layer. This bilayer encapsulation strategy efficiently slows the degradation of OPVs and represents a new method to encapsulate OPV and other organic devices."
71,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2019.2939070,2019.0,Using Large Datasets of Organic Photovoltaic Performance Data to Elucidate Trends in Reliability Between 2009 and 2019,"The application of data analytical approaches to understand long-term stability trends of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is presented. Nearly 1900 OPV data points have been catalogued, and multivariate analysis has been applied in order to identify patterns, produce models that quantitatively compare different internal and external stress factors, and subsequently enable predictions of OPV stability to be achieved. Analysis of the weights associated with the acquired predictive model shows that for light stability (ISOS-L) testing, the most significant factor for increasing the time taken to reach 80% of the initial performance (T80) is the substrate and top electrode selection, and the best light stability is achieved with a small molecule active layer. The weights for damp-heat (ISOS-D) testing shows that the type of encapsulation is the primary factor affecting the degradation to T80. The use of data analytics and potentially machine learning can provide researchers in this area new insights into degradation patterns and emerging trends."
72,10.1021/acsami.7b19442,2018.0,Influence of Environmentally Affected Hole-Transport Layers on Spatial Homogeneity and Charge-Transport Dynamics of Organic Solar Cells.,"After organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells achieved efficiency of more than 10%, the control of stability and degradation mechanisms of solar cells became a prominent task. The increase of device efficiency due to incorporation of a hole-transport layer (HTL) in bulk-heterojunction solar cells has been extensively reported. However, the most widely used HTL material, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is frequently suspected to be the dominating source for device instability under environmental conditions. Thereby, effects like photooxidation and electrode corrosion are often reported to shorten device lifetime. However, often in environmental device studies, the source of degradation, whether being from the HTL, the active layer, or the metal cathode is rather difficult to distinguish because the external diffusion of oxygen and water affects all components. In this study, different HTLs, namely, those prepared from traditional PEDOT:PSS and also two types of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) are exposed to different environments, such as oxygen, light, or humidity, prior to device finalization under inert conditions. This allows investigating any effects within the HTL and from reactions at its interface to the indium tin oxide electrode or the active layer. The surface and bulk chemistry of the exposed HTL has been monitored and discussed in context to the observed device physics, dynamic charge transport, and spatial performance homogeneity of the corresponding OPV device. The results show that merely humidity exposure of the HTL leads to decreased device performance for PEDOT:PSS, but also for one type of the tested MoO3. The losses are related to the amount of absorbed water in the HTL, inducing loss of active area in terms of interfacial contact. The device with PEDOT:PSS HTL after humid air exposure showed seriously decreased photocurrent by microdelamination of swelling/shrinkage of the hygroscopic layer. The colloidal MoO3 with water-based precursor solution presents slight decay of solar cell performance, also here caused by swelling/shrinking reaction, but by a combination of in-plane particle contact and resistance scaling with particle expansion. However, the device with quasi-continuous and alcohol-based MoO3 showed unharmed stable electrical performance."
73,10.1021/am506771e,2015.0,Root-cause failure analysis of photocurrent loss in polythiophene:fullerene-based inverted solar cells.,"Metal oxide transport layers have played a crucial role in recent progress in organic photovoltaic (OPV) device stability. Here, we measure the stability of inverted and encapsulated polythiophene:fullerene cells with MoO3/Ag/Al composite anode in operational conditions combining solar radiation and 65 °C. Performance loss of over 50% in the first 100 h of the aging is dominated by a drop in the short-circuit current (Jsc). We reveal a concurrent loss in reflectance from 85% to 50% above 650 nm, which is below the optical gap of the used photoactive materials, hence, excluding any major degradation in the bulk of this layer. Correlating the responses of aged devices to a series of test structures comprised of ITO/ZnO cathode, MoO3/Ag, and MoO3/Ag/Al anodes and their combinations with the active layer allowed us to identify that the presence of Al causes the reduced reflectance in these devices, independent of the presence of the active layer. Systematic single-stress aging on the test structures further indicates that elevated heat is the cause of the reflectance loss. Cross-section transmission electron microscopy coupled with elemental analysis revealed the unsuspected role of Al; notably, it diffuses through the entire 150 nm thick Ag layer and accumulates at the MoO3/Ag interface. Moreover, XRD analysis of the aged MoO3/Ag/Al anode indicates the formation of Ag2Al alloy. Depth profiling with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy advanced our understanding by confirming the formation of Ag-Al intermetallic alloy and the presence of oxidized Al only at the MoO3/Ag interface suggesting a concomitant reduction of MoO3 to most probably MoO2. This latter compound is less reflective than MoO3, which can explain the reduced reflectance in aged devices as proven by optical simulations. On the basis of these results, we could estimate that 20% of the loss in Jsc is ascribed to reduction of MoO3 triggered by its direct contact with Al."
74,10.1063/1.3298742,2010.0,Effects of concentrated sunlight on organic photovoltaics,"We report the effects of concentrated sunlight on key photovoltaic parameters and stability of organic photovoltaics (OPV). Sunlight collected and concentrated outdoors was focused into an optical fiber and delivered onto a 1 cm2 bulk-heterojunction cell. Sunlight concentration C was varied gradually from 0.2 to 27 suns. Power conversion efficiency exhibited slow increase with C that was followed by saturation around 2% at C=0.5–2.5 suns and subsequent strong reduction. Possible OPV applications in stationary solar concentrators (C≤2 suns) are discussed. Finally, experiments at C=55–58 suns demonstrated potential of our approach for accelerated studies of light induced mechanisms in the OPV degradation."

In view of this, we designed UV to visible photo-conversion YVO4: Eu3+, Bi3+ nano-films for the first time. These nano-films could not only filter out the harmful UV light to improve the lifetime of OPV, but also enhanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this paper, we present the preparation, structure and excellent photoconversion properties of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) microsized powders and the nano-film converters fabricated by laser ablation. Furthermore, the photo-stability of P3HT film with the converter was investigated. It is exciting to observe that the degradation of P3HT thin-film can be effectively retarded with the converter, about 3 fold compared to that of the glass reference. The photoconverter from UV to visible has the potential to be practically used in future OPV solar cells devices."

Therefore the diffusion of solar PV technologies has become a crucial component for both climate change mitigation and adaptation of the electrical system on a global scale. In this survey, we analyzed the state of the art of the present large scale Photovoltaic application (technology, size, efficiency, cost). We investigated also in detail the commercially available new PV technologies, e.g.: Thin film, Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), organic PV cells (OPV), and their near future's application perspectives. Finally, this paper summarizes the research findings of the new PV technologies' challenge that need to be overcome, on particular stability, efficiency, lifetime and degradation. In order to realize their potential as an economically viable path to harvesting energy from sunlight."
77,10.1002/admi.201900213,2019.0,Reducing Burn‐In Loss of Organic Photovoltaics by a Robust Electron‐Transporting Layer,"It is revealed that instability of interface between photoactive layer and electron‐transporting layer (ETL) is one of the causes of the rapid degradation of organic photovoltaics (OPV) performance during initial operation (burn‐in loss) under the light soaking. The stability of OPV is greatly enhanced by applying a robust ETL composed of TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs). The TNPs bound with π–π interactive 3‐phenylpentane‐2,4‐dione (TNP–Ph) form more robust ETLs than those bound with van der Waals interactive 3‐methyl‐2,4‐pentanedione TNP (TNP–Me). The OPV with TNP–Ph maintains 73% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000 h of light soaking, whereas the PCE of OPV with TNP–Me substantially reduces to 25% of initial PCE. The impedance analysis reveals that the burn‐in loss is due to increase of resistance at the TNP ETL/photoactive layer interface during the light soaking. The transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that the TNP–Ph maintains most clear and robust interface with photoactive layer after the light‐soaking test. This is attributed to the strong π–π interaction between phenyl rings of TNP–Ph. However, the TNP–Me bound with van der Waals interactive organic ligands penetrates the photoactive layer during the light‐soaking test."
78,10.1088/0957-4484/19/8/085712,2008.0,A novel polymer nanotube composite for photovoltaic packaging applications,"Packaging of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is an important issue which has been rarely addressed in the past. With the recent reports of high efficiency organic photovoltaics (6%), the need to produce materials which can effectively protect the device from degradation due to exposure to oxygen, moisture and radiation is pressing. We report a novel Saran (a co-polymer of vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile) based polymer nanotube composite, which shows high transparency in the visible region, good barrier properties and thermal stability, for use as an encapsulant for OPV devices. Different loadings of Saran and boron nitride nanotubes were taken and the composites were prepared to optimize the composition of the composite. UV–visible spectroscopy, infra-red spectroscopy and thermal analysis were used to characterize the composite. The barrier properties of the composite were tested on poly(3-hexylthiophene), which is used in high efficiency OPV devices."
79,10.1039/C2JM15670A,2012.0,Stable organic photovoltaics using Ag thin film anodes,"The interaction at the interface between a metal electrode and photoactive polymer is crucial for overall performance and stability of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this article, we report a comparative study of the stability of thin film Ag and indium tin oxide (ITO) as electrodes when used in conjunction with an interfacial PEDOT:PSS layer for P3HT:PCBM blend OPV devices. XPS measurements were taken for Ag and ITO/PEDOT:PSS layered samples with different exposure times to ambient conditions (∼25 °C, ∼50% relative humidity) to investigate the migration of Ag and In into the PEDOT:PSS layer. The change in efficiency of OPVs with a longer exposure time and degree of migration is explained by the analysis of XPS results. We propose the mechanism behind the interactions occurring at the interfaces. The efficiency of the ITO electrode OPVs continuously decreased to below 10% of the initial efficiency. However, the Ag devices displayed a slower degradation and maintained 50% of the initial efficiency for the same period of time."
80,,2019.0,Submission Format for IMS2004 (Title in 18-point Times font),"The application of data analytical approaches to understand long term stability trends of Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) is presented. Nearly 1900 OPV data points have been catalogued and multivariate-analysis has been applied in order to identify patterns, produce models that quantitatively compare different internal and external stress factors and subsequently enable predictions of OPV stability to be achieved. Analysis of the weights associated with the acquired predictive model shows that for light stability (ISOS-L) testing, the most significant factor for increasing the time taken to reach 80% of the initial performance (T80) is the substrate and top electrode selection and the best light stability is achieved with a small molecule active layer. The weights for damp-heat (ISOS-D) testing shows that the type of encapsulation is the primary factor affecting the degradation to T80. The use of data analytics and potentially machine learning can provide researchers in this area new insights into degradation patterns and emerging trends."
81,10.59627/cbens.2018.371,2018.0,LIFETIME STUDY OF ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC MATERIALS THROUGH OUTDOOR TESTS,"Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have undergone a significant development in recent years, with companies reaching efficiencies above 13%. Its unique features of transparency, light weight and flexibility allow the OPV application where conventional photovoltaics reach their limits, such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Many projects are emerging for this type of application, such as facade integration, and it is important to guarantee that the lifetime of the OPV devices is similar to what it is being integrated to. As a relatively recent technology, there are not many studies focusing on the stability and lifetime of OPV and even though standard tests have been defined for means of comparison of technology development, there are no appropriate qualification tests to assure the durability of the modules. As accelerated tests are not yet correlated to real operational conditions either, outdoor tests are a must to study degradation behaviors and pathways to improve the lifetime. In this paper, outdoor tests have been conducted for a period over a year to compare different photoactive materials and assess their stability under operational conditions. By the use of an in-house built software, the current-voltage measurements performed along the day hours were used to build degradation curves and model the energy generated over time. Differences in degradation rate were observed for the three polymers tested, as well as a relation between irradiation levels and the performance and stability of the devices."
82,10.1117/12.2273841,2017.0,"Stabilizing organic solar cells using antioxidants, radical scavengers and light stabilizers (Conference Presentation)","Record efficiencies of OPV devices nowadays reach well above 10%. However, their organic nature makes them strongly sensitive to oxygen, light, heat and humidity. 
We report on long-term stabilization by ternary blending the active layers with small amounts of stabilizing compounds of different classes of antioxidants[1,3], radical scavengers[1] and light stabilizers[2]. Lifetime testing was conducted under ISOS3-degradation conditions on bulk-heterojunction cells containing a wide selection of stabilizers. Microscopic and spectroscopic methods were applied to monitor chemical degradation over time, and the observed differences are discussed in terms of energetic trap states formation within the HOMO/LUMO gap of the photoactive material, morphological and structural changes.
Both antioxidants and UV absorbers yielded an increase of the accumulated power generation by over a factor of 3 compared to the reference devices without additive. In both cases, stability improvement was caused by significant reduction of radicals within the photoactive layer, which in turn stabilizes the performance by decreasing exciton recombination. However, stabilization mechanisms of these two classes are quite different, as reflected in the burn-in. While antioxidant-stabilized cells manifested a simultaneous increase of the burn-in period and decrease of decay magnitude, UV-absorber-stabilized cells retained the same burn-in period as the reference.

83,,2017.0,ced recombination in PTB 7 : PC 71 BM solar cells †,"Understanding degradation pathways in organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) is essential to achieve long term device stability and allow commercialisation. Upon exposure to an ambient atmosphere the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PTB7:PC71BM solar cells, cast using the solvent additive DIO, is markedly reduced. Using electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) spectroscopy, trap sites, which are formed when the blend is exposed to air and DIO, are identified. Spin-Rabi oscillations reveal that the resonance arises from a weakly coupled pair of spin 1/2 species, while selective injection of charge carriers into the cell demonstrates that the spin-pair corresponds to recombination of electrons and holes. The recombination is assigned to holes on the PTB7 recombining with electrons localised to oxygen induced PC71BM trap sites."
84,10.1117/12.2240031,2016.0,Mechanical properties of organic semiconductors for mechanically stable and intrinsically stretchable solar cells (Conference Presentation),"This presentation describes my group’s efforts to understand the molecular and microstructural basis for the mechanical properties of organic semiconductors for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Our work is motivated by two goals. The first goal is to mitigate mechanical forms of degradation of printed modules during roll-to-roll fabrication, installation, and environmental forces—i.e., wind, rain, snow, and thermal expansion and contraction. Mechanical stability is a prerequisite for inexpensive processing on flexible substrates: to encapsulate devices in glass is to surrender this advantage. The second goal is to enable the next generation of ultra-flexible and stretchable solar cells for collapsible, portable, and wearable applications, and as low-cost sources of energy—“solar tarps”—for disaster relief and for the developing world. It may seem that organic semiconductors, due to their carbon framework, are already sufficiently compliant for these applications. We have found, however, that the mechanical properties (stiffness and brittleness) occupy a wide range of values, and can be difficult to predict from molecular structure alone. We are developing an experimental and theoretical framework for how one can combine favorable charge-transport properties and mechanical compliance in organic semiconductor films. In particular, we have explored the roles of the backbone, alkyl side chain, microstructural order, the glass transition, molecular packing with fullerenes, plasticizing effects of additives, extent of separation of [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM, structural randomness in low-bandgap polymers, and reinforcement by encapsulation, on the mechanical compliance. We are exploring the applicability of semi-empirical “back-of-the-envelope” models, along with multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations, with the ultimate goal of designing electroactive organic materials whose mechanical properties can be dialed-in. We have used the insights we have developed to demonstrate several new applications for OPV that demand extreme compliance, including biaxial stretching and conformal bonding of whole devices to hemispheres, and devices with ultrathin encapsulation mounted on human skin that survive significant cyclic mechanical deformation in the outdoor environment."
85,,2016.0,Stabilizing Organic Solar Cells by Ternary Blending Active Layers with Additives,"Steady development of more efficient materials and advanced cell architectures over the past decades have made OPV more competitive with other thin film technologies record performances surpassed 10%, and the first products have been launched in the market. However, their comparably low stability positions them on the market merely as an exotic niche product. We are reporting on the possibilities of long-term stability improvement by ternary blending the active layers with small amounts of stabilizing compounds of different classes of antioxidants, radical scavengers and light stabilizers. We present the results of the lifetime investigations using a variety of compounds investigated in bulk-heterojunction, and characterized under ISOS-3 degradation conditions. Different microscopic and spectroscopic methods were applied to trace chemical degradation over time, and the observed differences in the stabilization of tested additives are discussed in terms of energetic trap states formation within the HOMO/LUMO gap of the photoactive material, morphological changes, and chemical structure."

88,10.1149/ma2023-024678mtgabs,2023.0,Revealing the Cycling and Degradation Mechanism of Bi-Metallates As Anode Materials for Na-Ion Batteries,"Na-ion batteries (NIBs) represent an emerging alternative to modern Li-ion batteries. To improve the overall performance of NIBs it is crucial to develop new types of anode materials with high capacity and long cycle life. Among the anode candidates, materials operating under combined conversion and alloying mechanisms (CAMs) are considered as promising. They are capable of delivering high capacity, however, despite theoretical predictions the cycling stability is still below expectations. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the cycling and degradation mechanisms of CAMs is crucial to improve their performance. However, these materials undergo multiple chemical transformations, which often involves formation of amorphous and nanocrystalline phases during cycling. Such chemical complexity substantially impedes their full characterization and understanding.
 Bismuth metallates, with a general formula of Bi-TM-O (TM = transition metal), is a group of ternary CAMs. Their general cycling mechanism consists of an irreversible conversion reaction, which leads to formation of Bi nanoparticles embedded in a Na-TM-O matrix during the first sodiation. This is followed by a reversible two-step alloying reaction leading to formation of Na3Bi with NaBi as an intermediate phase. In this work, we have used operando X-ray diffraction over the course of ∼30 cycles to study the cycling and degradation mechanisms of two CAMs - Bi2MoO6 and BiFeO3. With the help of ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, we have revealed new insights into these materials in addition to confirming the general cycling mechanism.
 Both materials form the cubic phase of Na3Bi (c-Na3Bi) in the sodiated state with some noticeable differences. While, the hexagonal Na3Bi (h-Na3Bi) phase starts to form after 10 cycles in Bi2MoO6, a combination of c-Na3Bi and h-Na3Bi can be observed after the first cycle in BiFeO3. The formation of c-Na3Bi is kinetically favorable in these systems, while h-Na3Bi is the more thermodynamically stable and, therefore, forms later in the cycling process. Both materials shows three distinct regions of capacity degradation, where the first is initiated by a growth in the crystallite sizes of Bi-particles. This is followed by a disappearance of the Bi-phase as the second step. The last degradation phase is related to the disappearance of the NaBi-phase and locking the system in the sodiated state. The present talk will discuss the mechanisms of these degradation steps in view of the future development of CAMs in greater details.

89,10.3390/pharmaceutics12020086,2020.0,Solid State Stability and Kinetics of Degradation for Candesartan—Pure Compound and Pharmaceutical Formulation,"The aim of this work was to assess the impact of an excipient in a pharmaceutical formulation containing candesartan cilexetil over the decomposition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and to comparatively investigate the kinetics of degradation during thermolysis in an oxidative atmosphere under controlled thermal stress. To achieve this, the samples were chosen as follows: pure candesartan cilexetil and a commercial tablet of 32 mg strength. As a first investigational tool, Universal attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (UATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was chosen in order to confirm the purity and identity of the samples, as well as to check if any interactions took place in the tablet between candesartan cilexetil and excipients under ambient conditions. Later on, samples were investigated by thermal analysis, and the elucidation of the decomposition mechanism was achieved solely after performing an in-depth kinetic study, namely the use of the modified non-parametric kinetics (NPK) method, since other kinetic methods (American Society for Testing and Materials—ASTM E698, Friedman and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa) led to inadvertencies. The NPK method suggested that candesartan cilexetil and the tablet were degraded by the contribution of two steps, the main being represented by chemical degradation and the secondary being a physical transformation. The excipients chosen in the formulation seemed to have a stabilizing effect on the decomposition of the candesartan cilexetil that was incorporated into the tablet, relative to pure active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), since the apparent activation energy for the decomposition of the tablet was 192.5 kJ/mol, in comparison to 154.5 kJ/mol for the pure API."
90,10.1002/dta.3030,2021.0,Stability and detectability of testosterone esters in Dried Blood Spots after intramuscular injections.,"While misuse of testosterone esters is widespread in elite and recreational sports, direct detection of intact testosterone esters in doping control samples is hampered by the rapid hydrolysis by esterases present in the blood. With dried blood spot (DBS) as sample matrix, continued degradation of the esters is avoided due to inactivation of the hydrolase enzymes in dried blood. Here we have developed the method further for detection of testosterone esters in DBS with focus on robustness and applicability in doping control. To demonstrate the method's feasibility, DBS samples from men receiving two intramuscular injections of Sustanon® 250 (n = 9) or placebo (n = 10), were collected, transported and stored prior to analysis, to mimic a doping control scenario. The presented nanoLC-HRMS/MS method appeared reliable and suitable for direct detection of four testosterone esters (testosterone decanoate, isocaproate, phenylpropionate and propionate) after extraction from DBS. Sustanon® was detected in all subjects for at least five days, with detection window up to 14 days for three of the esters. Evaluation of analyte stability showed that while storage at room temperature is tolerated well for a few days, testosterone esters are highly stable (> 18 months) in DBS when stored in frozen conditions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the applicability of DBS sampling in doping control for detection of steroid esters. The fast collection and reduced shipment costs of DBS compared to urine and standard blood samples, respectively, will allow more frequent and/or large-scale testing to increase detection and deterrence."
91,10.1002/adma.201603940,2017.0,Progress in Understanding Degradation Mechanisms and Improving Stability in Organic Photovoltaics,"Understanding the degradation mechanisms of organic photovoltaics is particularly important, as they tend to degrade faster than their inorganic counterparts, such as silicon and cadmium telluride. An overview is provided here of the main degradation mechanisms that researchers have identified so far that cause extrinsic degradation from oxygen and water, intrinsic degradation in the dark, and photo‐induced burn‐in. In addition, it provides methods for researchers to identify these mechanisms in new materials and device structures to screen them more quickly for promising long‐term performance. These general strategies will likely be helpful in other photovoltaic technologies that suffer from insufficient stability, such as perovskite solar cells. Finally, the most promising lifetime results are highlighted and recommendations to improve long‐term performance are made. To prevent degradation from oxygen and water for sufficiently long time periods, OPVs will likely need to be encapsulated by barrier materials with lower permeation rates of oxygen and water than typical flexible substrate materials. To improve stability at operating temperatures, materials will likely require glass transition temperatures above 100 °C. Methods to prevent photo‐induced burn‐in are least understood, but recent research indicates that using pure materials with dense and ordered film morphologies can reduce the burn‐in effect."
92,10.1002/advs.202105288,2022.0,Ultrathin and Efficient Organic Photovoltaics with Enhanced Air Stability by Suppression of Zinc Element Diffusion,"Ultrathin (thickness less than 10 µm) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) can be applied to power soft robotics and wearable electronics. In addition to high power conversion efficiency, stability under various environmental stresses is crucial for the application of ultrathin OPVs. In this study, the authors realize highly air‐stable and ultrathin (≈3 µm) OPVs that possess high efficiency (15.8%) and an outstanding power‐per‐weight ratio of 33.8 W g−1. Dynamic secondary‐ion mass spectrometry is used to identify Zn diffusion from the electron transport layer zinc oxide (ZnO) to the interface of photoactive layer; this diffusion results in the degradation of the ultrathin OPVs in air. The suppression of the Zn diffusion by a chelating strategy results in stable ultrathin OPVs that maintain 89.6% of their initial efficiency after storage for 1574 h in air at room temperature under dark conditions and 92.4% of their initial efficiency after annealing for 172 h at 85 °C in air under dark conditions. The lightweight and stable OPVs also possess excellent deformability with 87.3% retention of the initial performance after 5000 cycles of a compressing–stretching test with 33% compression."

Nevertheless, such OPV devices must meet certain optical and stability requirements to turn net zero energy greenhouse systems a reality. Here a donor:acceptor polymer blend is optimized for its use in laminated devices while matching the optical needs of crops. Optical modeling is performed and a greenhouse figure‐of‐merit is introduced to benchmark the trade‐off between photovoltaic performance and transparency for both chloroplasts and humans. Balanced donor:acceptor ratios result in better‐performing and more thermally stable devices than acceptor‐enriched counterparts. The optimized polymer blend and state‐of‐the‐art polymer:small‐molecule blends are next transferred to 25 cm2 laminated modules processed entirely from solution and in ambient conditions. The modules are mounted on a greenhouse as standalone or 4‐terminal tandem configurations and their outdoor stability is tracked for months. The study reveals degradation modes undetectable under laboratory conditions such as module delamination, which accounts for 10–20% loss in active area. Among the active layers tested, polymer:fullerene blends are the most stable and position as robust light harvesters in future building‐integrated OPV systems."

Yet, the optimization of the operational stability continues to be a challenge. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of a conjugated polyelectrolyte polymer (CPE-Na) as a hole layer (HTL) to improve the performance and longevity of OPV cells. Two different fabrication approaches were adopted: integrating CPE-Na with PEDOT:PSS to create a composite HTL and using CPE-Na as a stand-alone bilayer deposited beneath PEDOT:PSS on the ITO substrate. These configurations were compared against a reference device employing PEDOT:PSS alone, as the HTL increased efficiency and fill factor. The instruments with CPE-Na also demonstrated increased stability in the dark and under simulated operational conditions. Device-based PEDOT:PSS as an HTL reached T80 after 2500 h while involving CPE-Na in the device kept at T90 in the same period, evidenced by a reduced degradation rate. Furthermore, the impedance spectroscopy and photoinduced transient methods suggest optimized charge transfer and reduced charge carrier recombination. These findings collectively highlight the potential of CPE-Na as a HTL optimizer material for nonfluorine OPV cells."
95,10.1515/polyeng-2022-0104,2022.0,Boosting the photocatalytic performance of the oligo (phenylene vinylene) moiety by copolymerization for the heterogeneous degradation of indigo carmine dye,"Abstract The copolymerization with flexible and rigid spacers of 4,4’-((1E, 1′E)-(2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene)bis (ethene-2,1-diyl))dibenzoic acid, as a promising phenylene vinylene-based (PV) organic photocatalyst, was examined as a strategy to validate the effect of such chemical modifications in the modulation of the photocatalytic properties of this organic π-conjugated moiety. The polymers prepared here were fully characterized and evaluated as photocatalysts in the degradation of indigo carmine dye under two different irradiation scenarios (UVA and visible), consistently displaying a superior efficiency in contrast to their monomeric oligo (phenylene vinylene) (OPV) counterparts. Scavenging experiments confirmed that photocatalysis proceeds via the generation of superoxide radicals (O2•–), singlet oxygen (1O2), and direct oxidation. The obtained results proved that the insertion of an aromatic rigid spacer not only prompts an enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of the phenylene vinylene-based polymers but also increases the stability of the OPV moiety by minimizing the reaction of the vinyl fragments with reactive oxygen species. This was demonstrated with the reuse experiments, where 96% of the photocatalytic activity was preserved throughout the first five reuse cycles."
96,10.3390/nano14030269,2024.0,Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaic Devices: Interface/Bulk Properties and Stability Issues,"In the present work, an insight on the morpho/structural properties of semitransparent organic devices for buildings’ integrated photovoltaics is presented, and issues related to interface and bulk stability are addressed. The organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells under investigation are characterized by a blend of PM6:Y6 as a photo-active layer, a ZnO ETL (electron transporting layer), a HTL (hole transporting layer) of HTL-X and a transparent electrode composed by Ag nanowires (AgNWs). The devices’ active nanomaterials, processed as thin films, and their mutual nanoscale interfaces are investigated by a combination of in situ Energy Dispersive X-ray Reflectometry (EDXR) and ex situ Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and micro-Raman spectroscopy. In order to discriminate among diverse concomitant aging pathways potentially occurring upon working conditions, the effects of different stress factors were investigated: light and temperature. Evidence is gained of an essential structural stability, although an increased roughness at the ZnO/PM6:Y6 interface is deduced by EDXR measurements. On the contrary, an overall stability of the system subjected to thermal stress in the dark was observed, which is a clear indication of the photo-induced origin of the observed degradation phenomenon. Micro-Raman spectroscopy brings light on the origin of such effect, evidencing a photo-oxidation process of the active material in the device, using hygroscopic organic HTL, during continuous illumination in ambient moisture conditions. The process may be also triggered by a photocatalytic role of the ZnO layer. Therefore, an alternative configuration is proposed, where the hygroscopic HTL-X is replaced by the inorganic compound MoOx. The results show that such alternative configuration is stable under light stress (solar simulator), suggesting that the use of Molybdenum Oxide, limiting the photo-oxidation of the bulk PM6:Y6 active material, can prevent the cell from degradation."

Reaction of MDP-Lys(L18) with 0.1N NaOH at room temperature for 5 h gave D-1, and that with 1 N HCl under reflux for 1 h afforded D-4. MDP-Lys(L18) was found to be stable to light and heat. MDP-Lys(L18) in a powder form was stored at room temperature or at 25 degrees C and 75% relative humidity for 3 days to 18 months. Quantitative analysis, thin-layer chromatography, and tests for appearance and color change, etc., were performed in the stored samples. MDP-Lys(L18) was found to be stable, but hygroscopic."
99,10.1039/C7EE02415K,2018.0,"Interpretation and evolution of open-circuit voltage, recombination, ideality factor and subgap defect states during reversible light-soaking and irreversible degradation of perovskite solar cells","Metal halide perovskite absorber materials are about to emerge as a high-efficiency photovoltaic technology. At the same time, they are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing characterized by a low energy input and abundant low-cost materials. However, a further optimization of their efficiency, stability and reliability demands a more detailed optoelectronic characterization and understanding of losses including their evolution with time. In this work, we analyze perovskite solar cells with different architectures (planar, mesoporous, HTL-free), employing temperature dependent measurements (current–voltage, light intensity, electroluminescence) of the ideality factor to identify dominating recombination processes that limit the open-circuit voltage (Voc). We find that in thoroughly-optimized, high-Voc (≈1.2 V) devices recombination prevails through defects in the perovskite. On the other hand, irreversible degradation at elevated temperature is caused by the introduction of broad tail states originating from an external source (e.g. metal electrode). Light-soaking is another effect decreasing performance, though reversibly. Based on FTPS measurements, this degradation is attributed to the generation of surface defects becoming a new source of non-radiative recombination. We conclude that improving long-term stability needs to focus on adjacent layers, whereas a further optimization of efficiency of top-performing devices requires understanding of the defect physics of the nanocrystalline perovskite absorber. Finally, our work provides guidelines for the design of further dedicated studies to correctly interpret the diode ideality factor and decrease recombination losses."
100,10.1149/ma2023-02482429mtgabs,2023.0,Activity and Stability of High-Surface-Area Nickel-Based Catalysts for the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Under Industrially Relevant Conditions,"Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is at a stage of high technological maturity, and modern pressurized designs have mitigated the weaknesses of now-outdated atmospheric electrolyzers. For instance, pressurized systems now deliver high hydrogen outputs and can efficiently adjust to rapid changes in power loads. These improvements were, in part, made possible through significant reductions to internal ohmic losses coming from improved gas separators, shorter distances between electrodes, and increased operating temperatures.
 From an industrial point of view, the critical parameter to optimize is the full stack voltage. The stack voltage is tightly bound to the individual cell voltage and can thus be lowered by employing more efficient electrocatalysts. However, reducing the cell voltage by raising the temperature of operation—thereby improving both reaction kinetics and the conductivity of the KOH electrolyte—can be of similar or even higher importance (e.g., ca. 4.5 mV/˚C, Figure 1) [1]. Therefore, stability under operation at elevated temperatures must be considered when evaluating novel hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for AWE. Else, a novel catalyst risks becoming the bottleneck in the pursuit of higher operating temperatures, limiting its applicability for large-scale electrolysis [2]. Many assessments of novel AWE catalysts are still carried out at room temperature in diluted electrolytes and at low current densities [3]. In the harsher conditions of an electrolyzer, catalysts experience higher dissolution rates and are subject to higher mechanical stress from, for instance, the aggressive bubble evolution. This gap hinders the transfer of catalyst developments from academia to industrial research laboratories and, ultimately, to practical applications.
 In this work, we attempted to narrow that gap by conducting electrochemical measurements under more application-oriented conditions (i.e., 80-120 °C and 8-11 M KOH). We evaluated the HER activity and the robustness of high-surface-area electrodes produced through controlled leaching of bimetallic nickel-based alloys. A parametric study of the overpotential and robustness as a function of electrochemically active surface area was enabled by varying the synthesis parameters of a Raney-type preparation. Direct coupling to renewable energy sources requires the electrolyzer to frequently and rapidly shut off and on. This intermittent operation induces additional stress on the electrodes as the catalysts transition through different redox states, which is often overlooked in AWE electrocatalyst research. To track redox, compositional, and morphological changes, we used ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy. At the same time, the dissolution and redeposition of ionic species were monitored using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. By matching the characterization data with the evolution of the overpotential until complete deactivation, we gained an understanding of the degradation mechanisms in high-surface-area nickel-based electrodes. These results shed light on the challenges and prospects of this promising class of electrocatalysts for alkaline HER under industrial conditions.

101,10.3390/pharmaceutics14091967,2022.0,Stability Study of Alpinia galanga Constituents and Investigation of Their Membrane Permeability by ChemGPS-NP and the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay,"Alpinia galanga Willd., greater galangal, has been used for thousands of years as a spice as well as in traditional medicine. Its central nervous system (CNS) stimulant activity and neuroprotective effects have been proved both in animal models and human trials. However, the compounds responsible for these effects have not been identified yet. Therefore, the main constituents (p-OH-benzaldehyde (1), trans-p-coumaryl-alcohol (2), p-coumaryl-aldehyde (4), galanganol A (5), galanganol B (6), trans-p-acetoxycinnamyl alcohol (7), 1′S-1′-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA, 9), and 1′S-1′-acetoxyeugenol acetate (AEA, 10)) were isolated to investigate their aqueous stability and passive diffusion across the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) membrane and the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA). Our positive results for compounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 10 suggest good permeability, thus potential contribution to the effects of greater galangal in the CNS. The results of the PAMPA-BBB were corroborated by in silico chemography-based ChemGPS-NP framework experiments. In addition, examination of the chemical space position of galangal compounds in relation to known psychostimulants revealed that all the molecules in proximity are NET/SERT inhibitors. As ACA and AEA did not show much proximity to either compound, the importance of further investigation of their degradation products becomes more pronounced."
102,10.1021/acsaem.1c03994,2022.0,Significant Stability Improvement of Fullerene Organic Photovoltaics via ZnO Film Modification through the Intermittent Spray Pyrolysis Technique,"Morphological control of the layers within the bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ-OPVs) is a key feature that governs their performance. In the present work, we demonstrate that zinc oxide—ZnO—interlayers sprayed via the intermittent spray pyrolysis technique, employing a low-concentration precursor solution, can yield inverted BHJ-OPVs as efficient as the standard reported ones using the conventional laboratory-scale spin-coating technique. However, we record a pioneer stability behavior of the fabricated inverted fullerene organic photovoltaics (iF-OPVs) with various sprayed ZnO conditions. Thus, after optimizing the sprayed ZnO interfacial layer morphology for the inverted PTB7-Th:PC70BM devices, by carefully inspecting the interdependence between the sprayed ZnO thin film morphology and the figures of merit of the optimized iF-OPVs, we conducted a distinct analysis on the optical and electronic properties of the fresh and degraded devices using external quantum efficiency measurements and impedance spectroscopy. Hence, we showed that the most proper ZnO microstructural morphology was obtained by spraying 25 running cycles (25R). Remarkably, we observed that 25R-ZnO-based iF-OPV devices showed a stunning stability behavior and maintained 85% of their initial power conversion efficiency even after 16.7 months without encapsulation in a dry nitrogen glovebox, demonstrating an excellent shelf stability. Accordingly, this approach might facilitate the scalability of inverted OPVs for industrial production visibility."

Judicious screening of the perovskite precursor solution realizes a power conversion efficiency of 18.0% for mesoporous perovskite solar cells as a result of improved surface coverage. A slower degradation in ambient air is observed with this modified perovskite.

The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has in the last decade been increased by almost a factor of ten approaching 10%. A main concern has been the stability that was previously measured in minutes, but can now, in favorable circumstances, exceed many thousands of hours. This astonishing achievement is the subject of this article, which reviews the developments in stability/degradation of OPVs in the last five years. This progress has been gained by several developments, such as inverted device structures of the bulk heterojunction geometry device, which allows for more stable metal electrodes, the choice of more photostable active materials, the introduction of interfacial layers, and roll‐to‐roll fabrication, which promises fast and cheap production methods while creating its own challenges in terms of stability."
105,10.1021/acsami.7b01183,2017.0,Influence of the Hole Transporting Layer on the Thermal Stability of Inverted Organic Photovoltaics Using Accelerated-Heat Lifetime Protocols,"High power conversion efficiency (PCE) inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) usually use thermally evaporated MoO3 as a hole transporting layer (HTL). Despite the high PCE values reported, stability investigations are still limited and the exact degradation mechanisms of inverted OPVs using thermally evaporated MoO3 HTL remain unclear under different environmental stress factors. In this study, we monitor the accelerated lifetime performance under the ISOS-D-2 protocol (heat conditions 65 °C) of nonencapsulated inverted OPVs based on the thiophene-based active layer materials poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPPTTT) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC[70]BM). The presented investigation of degradation mechanisms focus on optimized P3HT:PC[70]BM-based inverted OPVs. Specifically, we present a systematic study on the thermal stability of inverted P3HT:PC[70]BM OPVs using solution-processed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and evaporated MoO3 HTL. Using a series of measurements and reverse engineering methods, we report that the P3HT:PC[70]BM/MoO3 interface is the main origin of failure of the P3HT:PC[70]BM-based inverted OPVs under intense heat conditions, a trend that is also observed for the other two thiophene-based polymers used in this study."
106,10.1002/aenm.201401912,2015.0,The Critical Choice of PEDOT:PSS Additives for Long Term Stability of Roll‐to‐Roll Processed OPVs,"The impact of additives mixed with poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) on the stability of organic photovoltaic modules is investigated for fully ambient roll‐to‐roll (R2R) processed indium tin oxide free modules. Four different PEDOT:PSS inks from two different suppliers are used. The modules are manufactured directly on barrier foil without a UV filter to accelerate degradation and enable completion of the study in a reasonable time span. The modules are subjected to stability testing following well‐established protocols developed by the international summit on organic photovoltaic stability (ISOS). For the harsh indoor test (ISOS‐L‐3) only a slight difference in stability is observed between the different modules. During both ISOS‐L‐3 and ISOS‐D‐3 one new failure mode is observed as a result of tiny air inclusions in the barrier foil and a R2R method is developed to detect and quantify these. During outdoor operation (ISOS‐O‐1) the use of ethylene glycol (EG) as an additive is found to drastically increase the operational stability of the modules as compared to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and a new failure mode specific to modules with DMSO as the additive is identified. The data are extended in an ongoing experiment where DMSO is used as additive for long‐term outdoor testing in a solar park."

Despite the efficiencies being appealing (over 17%), the technological transfer is still limited by the low durability. Several processes, in bulk and at interface, are responsible. The quick downgrading of the performance is due to a combination of physical and chemical degradations. These phenomena induce instability and a drop of performance in working conditions. Close monitoring of these processes is mandatory to understand the degradation pathways upon device operation. Here, an unconventional approach based on Energy Dispersive X-ray Reflectivity (ED-XRR) performed in-situ is used to address the role of Wells–Dawson polyoxometalate (K6-P2W18O62, hereafter K6-P2W18) as hole transporting layer in organic photovoltaics. The results demonstrate that K6-P2W18 thin films, showing ideal bulk and interface properties and superior optical/morphological stability upon prolonged illumination, are attractive candidates for the interface of durable OPV devices."
108,10.3390/molecules26102874,2021.0,Stability Enhancement of a Dimeric HER2-Specific Affibody Molecule through Sortase A-Catalyzed Head-to-Tail Cyclization,"Natural backbone-cyclized proteins have an increased thermostability and resistance towards proteases, characteristics that have sparked interest in head-to-tail cyclization as a method to stability-enhance proteins used in diagnostics and therapeutic applications, for example. In this proof-of principle study, we have produced and investigated a head-to-tail cyclized and HER2-specific ZHER2:342 Affibody dimer. The sortase A-mediated cyclization reaction is highly efficient (>95%) under optimized conditions, and renders a cyclic ZHER3:342-dimer with an apparent melting temperature, Tm, of 68 °C, which is 3 °C higher than that of its linear counterpart. Circular dichroism spectra of the linear and cyclic dimers looked very similar in the far-UV range, both before and after thermal unfolding to 90 °C, which suggests that cyclization does not negatively impact the helicity or folding of the cyclic protein. The cyclic dimer had an apparent sub-nanomolar affinity (Kd ~750 pM) to the HER2-receptor, which is a ~150-fold reduction in affinity relative to the linear dimer (Kd ~5 pM), but the anti-HER2 Affibody dimer remained a high-affinity binder even after cyclization. No apparent difference in proteolytic stability was detected in an endopeptidase degradation assay for the cyclic and linear dimers. In contrast, in an exopeptidase degradation assay, the linear dimer was shown to be completely degraded after 5 min, while the cyclic dimer showed no detectable degradation even after 60 min. We further demonstrate that a site-specifically DyLight 594-labeled cyclic dimer shows specific binding to HER2-overexpressing cells. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that head-to-tail cyclization can be an effective strategy to increase the stability of an Affibody dimer."
109,10.1021/acsami.5b03970,2015.0,Enhanced Stability of Aluminum Nanoparticle-Doped Organic Solar Cells.,"Enhancement of the stability of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is reported by the addition of surfactant-free aluminum (Al) nanoparticles (NPs) into the photoactive layer. The universality of the effect is demonstrated for two different BHJ systems, namely, the well-studied poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) as well as the high efficient poly[N-9'-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole)]:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC71BM). It is shown that the lifetime of the devices with Al NPs, operating under continuous one-sun illumination in ambient conditions, is more than three times longer compared to the reference devices. Using complementary analytical techniques for in situ studies, we have explored the underlying mechanisms behind the observed stability improvement in the case of the P3HT:PCBM system. In particular, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), photoluminescence decay and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy experiments were performed and complemented with device degradation electrical measurements. It is found that the embedded Al NPs act as performance stabilizers, giving rise to enhanced structural stability of the active blend. Furthermore, it is revealed that the observed improvement can also be ascribed to NP-mediated mitigation of the photo-oxidation effect. This study addresses a major issue in OPV devices, that is, photoinduced stability, indicating that the exploitation of Al NPs could be a successful approach toward fabricating OPVs exhibiting long-term operating lifetimes."
110,10.1039/c4cp01598c,2014.0,The use of UV/ozone-treated MoS2 nanosheets for extended air stability in organic photovoltaic cells.,"MoS2 nanosheets obtained through a simple sonication exfoliation method are employed as a hole-extraction layer (HEL) to improve the efficiency and air stability of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). The reduction in the wavenumber difference, appearance of a UV-vis peak, and atomic force microscopy images indicate that MoS2 nanosheets are formed through the sonication method. The OPVs with MoS2 layers show a degraded performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.08%, which is lower than that of OPVs without HEL (1.84%). After performing the UV/ozone (UVO) treatment of the MoS2 surface for 15 min, the PCE value increases to 2.44%. Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy data show that the work function of MoS2 increases from 4.6 to 4.9 eV upon UVO treatment, suggesting that the increase in the PCE value is caused by the bandgap alignment. Upon inserting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) between MoS2 and the active layer, the PCE value of the OPV increases to 2.81%, which is comparable with that of the device employing only PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, the stability of the OPVs is improved significantly when MoS2/PEDOT:PSS layers are used as the HEL. Therefore, it is considered that the use of UVO-treated MoS2 may improve the stability of OPV cells without degrading the device performance."
111,10.1101/2020.06.11.20128884,2020.0,Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on critical personal protective equipment,"The spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings is concerning, with healthcare workers representing a disproportionately high percentage of confirmed cases. Although SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to persist on surfaces for a number of days, the extent and duration of fomites as a mode of transmission, particularly in healthcare settings, has not been fully characterized. To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable by TCID 50 assay within 24 h. These findings underline the importance of appropriate handling of contaminated PPE during and following use in high-risk settings and provide interesting insight into the potential utility of cotton in limiting COVID-19 transmission."
112,10.1002/adma.202002217,2020.0,"Progress in Materials, Solution Processes, and Long‐Term Stability for Large‐Area Organic Photovoltaics","Organic solar cells based on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) are attractive energy‐conversion devices that can generate electricity from absorbed sunlight by dissociating excitons and collecting charge carriers. Recent breakthroughs attained by development of nonfullerene acceptors result in significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCEs) exceeding 17%. However, most of researches have focused on pursuing high efficiency of small‐area (<1 cm2) unit cells fabricated usually with spin coating. For practical application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) from lab‐scale unit cells to industrial products, it is essential to develop efficient technologies that can extend active area of devices with minimized loss of performance and ensured operational stability. In this progress report, an overview of recent advancements in materials and processing technologies is provided for transitioning from small‐area laboratory‐scale devices to large‐area industrial scale modules. First, development of materials that satisfy requirements of high tolerability in active layer thickness and large‐area adaptability is introduced. Second, morphology control using various coating techniques in a large active area is discussed. Third, the recent research progress is also underlined for understanding mechanisms of OPV degradation and studies for improving device long‐term stability along with reliable evaluation procedures."
113,10.1089/ars.2010.3458,2011.0,Improving the stability of α-conotoxin AuIB through N-to-C cyclization: the effect of linker length on stability and activity at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.,"Modification of α-conotoxin frameworks through cyclization via an oligopeptide linker has previously been shown as an effective strategy for improving in vivo stability. We have extended this strategy by investigating cyclic analogs of α-conotoxin AuIB, a selective α(3)β(4) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, to examine a range of oligopeptide linker lengths on the oxidative formation of disulfide bonds, activity at nAChRs, and stability to degradation by chymotrypsin. Upon nondirected random oxidation, the ribbon isomer formed preferentially with the globular isomer occurring as a minor by-product. Therefore, a regioselective disulfide bond forming strategy was used to prepare the cAuIB-2 globular isomer in high yield and purity. The cAuIB-2 globular isomer exhibited a threefold decrease in activity for the α(3)β(4) nAChR compared to wild-type-AuIB, although it was selective for α(3)β(4) over α(7) and α(4)β(2) subtypes. On the other hand, the cAuIB-2 ribbon isomer was shown to be inactive at all three nAChR subtypes. Nonetheless, all of the cyclic analogs were found to be significantly more stable to degradation by chymotrypsin than wild-type AuIB. As such, the cAuIB-2 globular isomer could constitute a useful probe for studying the role of the α(3)β(4) nAChR in a range of in vivo experimental paradigms."
114,,2017.0,Photocurable polymeric coatings for improved stability and multifunctionality in solution-processable photovoltaics,"Photovoltaic (PV) technology has evolved rapidly in the past few decades and now encompasses a large variety of materials and device structures. A key aspect to be taken into account in any PV technology is the operational durability of these systems in outdoor conditions. Clearly, loss of performance during operation represents a significant drawback and limitation for their commercialization. In this context, the large compositional flexibility of polymeric materials as well as their proven easy processability may be of great help in imparting improved durability to PV systems. In this contribution, a series of photocurable fluoropolymeric systems will be presented that find application as multifunctional coatings for different solution-processable PV devices, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic PVs (OPVs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Aspects related to the chemical functionalization of the coating precursors will be addressed in view of the incorporation of multiple functionalities into the final coating material, such as high photochemical durability, luminescent down-shifting, UV-screening, high hydrophobicity and easy-cleanability. In addition, a thorough chemical and physical characterization of the coating materials will be presented. The functional properties of these systems will be evaluated by integrating them into operating DSSC, OPV and PSC devices. It will be demonstrated that by synthetically tuning the functionality of the coating system as a function of the target PV technology, improved power conversion efficiency and unmatched long-term operational stability can be achieved on all PV systems investigated. The general approach presented here gives a clear demonstration of the enormous potential of this technology for the straightforward fabrication of solution-processable PV devices with improved performance and enhanced stability without altering the chemistry of the photoactive layer."
115,10.1021/am900875g,2010.0,"Poly(ethylene glycol)-based thiol-ene hydrogel coatings-curing chemistry, aqueous stability, and potential marine antifouling applications.","Photocured thiol-ene hydrogel coatings based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were investigated for marine antifouling purposes. By varying the PEG length, vinylic end-group, and thiol cross-linker, a library of hydrogel coatings with different structural composition was efficiently accomplished, with or without ester linkages. The thiol-methacrylate and thiol-allyl systems were evaluated with respect to curing, degradation, as well as antifouling properties. Methacrylate-based systems exhibited homopolymerization, whereas allyl-based systems reacted more selectively through thiol-ene couplings reaction. The ester-free hydrogels elucidated higher hydrolytic stability whereas longer PEG chains accelerated the degradation process. The antifouling properties were evaluated by protein adsorption with Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bioassays with the marine bacteria, Cobetia marina, and the marine diatom, Amphora coffeaeformis; in all tests, longer PEG lengths improved the antifouling properties."
116,10.1557/jmr.2018.239,2018.0,The path to ubiquitous organic electronics hinges on its stability,"In the year 2004, a revealing review by Stephen Forrest pointed to how organic electronics could shake up the conventional semiconductor industry by exploring the fact that organic semiconductors, in principle, could be processed on inexpensive plastic substrates of virtually any shape from solution or gas phase using high throughput methods. One of the key challenges identified was the successful translation from the proofof-concept using lab-scale approaches to large-area appliances. This would require a high degree of innovation to achieve ultra low-cost fabrication methodologies, compatible with industrial standards. Since then, the processing of organic semiconductors through printing and coating techniques to realize life size device fabrication has developed rapidly, to the extent that organic light emitting diodes (OLED), organic field effect transistors (OFET), and organic photovoltaics (OPV) advanced from a lab curiosity to commercialized mainstream technologies, mainly in the form of displays and, partially, solar modules. Today, organic printed electronics are evolving towards smart, highly functional sensors, monitoring temperature, pressure, optical signals, and even physiological parameters. An extension of this development is the emerging interest in the integration of organic semiconductors into imperceptible electronics, soft machines, and detectors of neurological activity. This is possible because organic devices can now be processed onto ultrathin (;1lm), ultra-flexible and stretchable substrates, allowing electronics to seemingly conform to three-dimensional shapes and biological tissue. These are obviously very exciting developments, where interfacing organic electronics with biological material brings about its own technological challenges. Still, a common, often underestimated, problem for early and advanced applications of organic electronics is the device stability with respect to environmental contaminants – mainly oxygen and moisture – light, and mechanical stress. From the more established organic electronics technologies such as OLED and OPV, it is well known that packaging costs typically dominate the overall production cost because the performance of these types of devices quickly deteriorates when the permeation of moisture and oxygen exceeds 10 g/m-2/day and 10 cm3/m2/day/bar, respectively. To date, long operation times rely on costly, high barrier materials. This imposes significant economic burdens on the costs of a final product and limits the ubiquitous adoption of organic electronics. Thus, in order to take full advantage of the low-cost factor of mass-printed organic electronics it is critically important to adopt inexpensive packaging materials with limited oxygen and moisture barrier properties, similar to what is used in the food industry. Some of the emanating technologies described previously may even preclude the use of any barrier. Consequently, conceptually new strategies are necessary for the stabilization of organic electronic materials and devices. This was the driving challenge to be addressed in this Focus Issue. The reasons for the instability of organic electronics are truly manifold and often system specific. The latter adds additional complexity and makes a universal solution unlikely. Importantly, identifying the underlying degradation mechanism is a tedious, yet essential, process towards a complete understanding and problem solving. This is reflected in the present Focus Issue, which explores an interesting combination of ideas, covering material strategies, device engineering, characterization techniques, and engineering of barriers, while envisioning future applications. For instance, the group of Jean Manca analyzed the requirements for a successful implementation of organic solar cells for space application during a stratospheric balloon flight. OPV has been long foreseen as a very interesting technology for space applications due to its very high power output per unit weight. Yet, this is the first study of its kind.

117,,2019.0,Performance and stability of semitransparent OPVs for building,"9 Semitransparent (ST) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are demonstrating great potential 10 for building integration applications, especially in windows. For that purpose, ST-OPVs 11 should achieve adequate transparency and performance stability. In this regard, the 12 present research deals with the experimental performance of three different building13 integrated ST-OPV technologies (technology A: developed in the frame of the present 14 study; technologies B and C: commercial modules). More specifically, spectral 15 transmittance and electrical measurements have been conducted in order to determine 16 the characteristics of the modules for building integration and electricity generation 17 purposes. Results regarding the transmittance reveal that technology A outperforms 18 technologies B and C. The stability analysis of the modules verifies that module C is the 19 most stable one with almost no decrease (3.6%) in the power conversion efficiency 20 (PCE). Furthermore, the PCE of technology B is slightly higher than in the case of 21 technology C, which experiences a PCE degradation of about 10-15% over the whole 22 time period. Finally, technology A presents a 20% reduction in PCE at around 500 23 hours. 24"
118,10.1039/C5RA24010G,2015.0,Stability enhancement of organic photovoltaic devices utilizing partially reduced graphene oxide as the hole transport layer: nanoscale insight into structural/interfacial properties and aging effects,"A powerful insight into the structural and interfacial properties of post-fabricated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is reported. The nanoscale local structure of integrated devices is revealed by combined X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF) investigations. A comparative study is performed on devices using graphene oxide (GO) as the hole transporting layer (HTL) and reference PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) devices. Spatially resolved simultaneous XRD/XRF measurements with nanometre resolution on pristine and aged states of the devices evidence the occurrence of morphological modifications in the poly(2,7-carbazole) derivative (PCDTBT):fullerene derivative (PC71BM) active layer, induced by thermal reduction and solar illumination. Additionally, the results indicate that OPV devices with partially reduced graphene oxide (pr-GO) used as the HTL, exhibit photovoltaic characteristics similar to the PEDOT:PSS based devices but with a significant durability enhancement. This is attributed to the protecting role of the pr-GO film against humidity and indium diffusion from the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) anode into the photoactive layer. As a result, the devices fabricated with pr-GO-HTL retain approximately 65% of their initial power conversion efficiency over 20 hours, while the efficiency of the reference devices degrades to 45% of the initial value."
119,10.1021/OL9906662,1999.0,Stability of Cyanuric Acid to Photocatalytic Degradation,"Cyanuric acid is unique among organic molecules in being resistant to photocatalytic degradative conditions by TiO2 in oxygenated water. Trimethyl cyanurate shows an isotope effect of 3.1−3.3 on degradation selectivity when the methyl groups are deuterated, and cyanuric acid enriched in 18O does not exchange hydroxyl groups with bulk water under these conditions. Thus, the tolerance of cyanuric acid to photocatalysis is not due to rapid and reversible addition to the aromatic nucleus."

The molecules were designed aiming at tuning their HOMO−LUMO levels without remarkably changing their optical properties. The syntheses were carried out through a convergent−divergent approach by reaction of a 7,7‘-diiodobifluorene building block with 2-fluoren-7-yl-ethynyl (BF1), 2-carbazol-3-yl-ethynyl (BF2), 2-fluoren-7-yl-ethenyl (BF3), and 2-carbazol-3-yl-ethenyl (BF4) moieties. The analysis of the optical properties evidenced for BF1−4 an efficient blue emission in solution. Their emission profile is preserved also in the solid state, except for that of BF4, the PL spectrum of which showed the appearance of a green band deriving from aerobic degradation. The HOMO value of −5.00 eV, measured for BF4 by cyclic voltammetry, suggested a correlation of the spectral instability with its low ionization potential. This hypothesis was confirmed by ..."
121,10.3390/v16060961,2024.0,Application of MPBT Assay for Multiplex Determination of Infectious Titers and for Selection of the Optimal Formulation for the Trivalent Novel Oral Poliovirus Vaccine,"Recently, a multiplex PCR-based titration (MPBT) assay was developed for simultaneous determination of infectious titers of all three Sabin strains of the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to replace the conventional CCID50 assay, which is both time-consuming and laborious. The MPBT assay was shown to be reproducible, robust and sensitive. The conventional and MPBT assays showed similar results and sensitivity. The MPBT assay can be completed in two to three days, instead of ten days for the conventional assay. To prevent attenuated vaccine strains of poliovirus from reversion to virulence, a novel, genetically stable OPV (nOPV) was developed by modifying the genomes of conventional Sabin strains used in OPV. In this work, we evaluated the MPBT assay as a rapid screening tool to support trivalent nOPV (tnOPV) formulation development by simultaneous titration of the three nOPV strains to confirm stability as needed, for the selection of the lead tnOPV formulation candidate. We first assessed the ability of the MPBT assay to discriminate a 0.5 log10 titer difference by titrating the two tnOPV samples (undiluted and threefold-diluted) on the same plate. Once the assay was shown to be discriminating, we then tested different formulations of tnOPV drug products (DPs) that were subjected to different exposure times at 37 °C (untreated group and treated groups: 2 and 7 days at 37 °C), and to three freeze and thaw (FT) cycles. Final confirmation of the down selected formulation candidates was achieved by performing the conventional CCID50 assay, comparing the stability of untreated and treated groups and FT stability testing on the top three candidates. The results showed that the MPBT assay generates similar titers as the conventional assay. By testing two trivalent samples in the same plate, the assay can differentiate a 0.5 log10 difference between the titers of the tested nOPV samples. Also, the assay was able to detect the gradual degradation of nOPV viruses with different formulation compositions and under different time/temperature conditions and freeze/thaw cycles. We found that there were three tnOPV formulations which met the stability criteria of less than 0.5 log10 loss after 2 days’ exposure to 37 ℃ and after three FT cycles, maintaining the potency of all three serotypes in these formulations. The ability of the MPBT assay to titrate two tnOPV lots (six viruses) in the same plate makes it cheaper and gives it a higher throughput for rapid screening. The assay detected the gradual degradation of the tnOPV and was successful in the selection of optimal formulations for the tnOPV. The results demonstrated that the MPBT method can be used as a stability indicating assay to assess the thermal stability of the nOPV. It can be used for rapid virus titer determination during the vaccine manufacturing process, and in clinical trials. The MPBT assay can be automated and applied for other viruses, including those with no cytopathic effect."
122,10.1021/JP012186+,2001.0,Thermal Stability and High Temperature Graphitization of Bisazafullerene (C59N)2 As Studied by IR and Raman Spectroscopy,"Thermal stability and high-temperature degradation of pristine bisazafullerene (C59N)2 were analyzed by infrared and Raman spectroscopy in the temperature range from 300 to 745 K. The spectra showed a reversible temperature dependence up to 550 K. For higher temperatures an irreversible degradation into disordered graphite was found. Approximately 55% of the material resisted a thermal treatment of 745 K for several hours. A mechanism involving a low stationary concentration of C59N• monomer radical species and a slow graphitization is proposed for the thermolysis of the material. The remarkable thermal stability of pristine bisazafullerene (C59N)2 is ascribed to the low stability of the C59N• monomer radical species, the high activation energy for graphitization, and the absence of other reaction partners under high vacuum conditions."
123,10.3390/ijms242316880,2023.0,Autophagy and Senescence: The Molecular Mechanisms and Implications in Liver Diseases,"The liver is the primary organ accountable for complex physiological functions, including lipid metabolism, toxic chemical degradation, bile acid synthesis, and glucose metabolism. Liver function homeostasis is essential for the stability of bodily functions and is involved in the complex regulation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Cell proliferation-halting mechanisms, including autophagy and senescence, are implicated in the development of several liver diseases, such as cholestasis, viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Among various cell death mechanisms, autophagy is a highly conserved and self-degradative cellular process that recycles damaged organelles, cellular debris, and proteins. This process also provides the substrate for further metabolism. A defect in the autophagy machinery can lead to premature diseases, accelerated aging, inflammatory state, tumorigenesis, and cellular senescence. Senescence, another cell death type, is an active player in eliminating premalignant cells. At the same time, senescent cells can affect the function of neighboring cells by secreting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and induce paracrine senescence. Autophagy can promote and delay cellular senescence under different contexts. This review decodes the roles of autophagy and senescence in multiple liver diseases to achieve a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and implications of autophagy and senescence in various liver diseases."

Shiseido C18 (250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D., 5 μm particle size) column was used as stationary phase with mobile phase consisting methanol+acetonitrile (80:20): phosphate buffer (pH 3.0 adjusted with ortho phosphoric acid) in the ratio of 75:25, v/v. The flow rate was maintained at 1.2 ml/min and effluents were monitored at 245 nm. The retention time was found to be 2.837 minutes. The forced degradation studies were performed as per ICH guidelines under acidic, alkali, oxidative, thermal, photostability and neutral conditions. The drug peak was well resolved from the peaks of degraded products. From the degradation studies it is evident that the drug showed instability under acidic, alkali, oxidative, thermal, photostability and neutral conditions. The linearity of the method was observed in the concentration range of 10-60 μg/ml with the number of theoretical plates & tailing factor being 5550 & 1.17 respectively with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. The percentage assay of Liraglutide was found to be 99.66%. The method was validated for its accuracy, precision and system suitability. The results obtained in the study were within the limits of ICH guidelines and hence this method can be used for the estimation of Liraglutide in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage forms."
126,10.1021/BI0022240,2001.0,"Role of alpha-helix seven of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ab delta-endotoxin in membrane insertion, structural stability, and ion channel activity.","Domain I of the Cry1Ab insecticidal toxic protein has seven alpha-helices and is considered to be involved in the ion channel activity. While other alpha-helices, particularly alpha-4 and alpha-5, have been extensively explored, the remaining alpha-helices have been slightly studied. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutations throughout sequences encoding the alpha-helix 7 to test its role in ion channel function. Every amino acid residue in alpha-helix 7 was mutated to alanine. Most resultant proteins, e.g., D225A, W226A, Y229A, N230A, R233A, R234A, D242A, and F247A yielded no protoxin or were sensitive to degradation by trypsin or Manduca sexta midgut juice. Other mutant proteins, R224A, R228A, and E235A, were resistant to degradation to the above proteases but were 8, 30, and 12 times less toxic to M. sexta, respectively, than the wild-type Cry1Ab. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated a very small change in the R228A spectrum, while R224A and E235A display the same spectrum as the wild-type protein. These three mutant proteins showed little differences from Cry1Ab when analyzed by saturation binding and competition binding kinetics with (125)I-labeled toxin or by surface plasmon resonance to M. sexta brush border membrane vesicles. More conservative amino acid substitutions were introduced into alpha-helix 7 residues: R228K, F232Y, E235Q, and F247Y. In comparison with wild-type Cry1Ab, mutant proteins R228K, F232Y, E235A, and E235Q selectively discriminate between K+ and Rb+, while R224A and R228A had reduced inhibition of short-circuit current for both ions, when analyzed by voltage clamping of M. sexta midguts."
127,10.1080/028418699431401,1999.0,Stability and immunoreactivity of the monoclonal anticytokeratin antibody TS1 after different degrees of iodination.,"The immunoreactivity, stability and in vivo kinetics of an anticytokeratin 8 monoclonal antibody, TS1, were investigated following different degrees of labeling with 125I (0.2, 1 and 2-3 125I/TS1 MAb). By testing with ELISA, it was demonstrated that a high degree of iodination, i.e. > 2 125I/TS1, caused a rapid decrease in immunoreactivity to almost zero within 10 days. Furthermore, a complete degradation to low molecular weight fragments and free iodine was seen, as shown by SDS PAGE and autoradiography. The differently labeled radionuclide conjugates were injected into nude mice inoculated with HeLa Hep2 cells and tumor doses (estimated by MIRD formalism), tumor:non-tumor dose ratios, % I.D./gram tissue, Gy/MBq and in vivo kinetics of the differently labeled MAbs were determined. Despite the in vitro instability of the highest iodinated radionuclide conjugate, it was possible to deliver high doses to the tumors if the conjugate was injected into the animal immediately after completion of the iodination procedure. Increases from 1.4 Gy to 15.2 Gy delivered tumor dose were obtained with a tenfold increase in the specific activity, without alterations in the tumor:non-tumor tissue dose ratios. There is room for significant improvements in efficacy at radioimmunotherapy, which can be gained by optimizing the degree of iodination. For therapeutical applications a high degree of iodination may be an advantage."

In this study, we investigate the process of selecting and evaluating organic materials for use in OPV applications, with a particular emphasis on improving both efficiency and stability. In this study, the most important results are highlighted by means of a complete literature review and data analysis. Bandgaps, HOMO levels, and LUMO levels are all features of the material that play a significant role in determining the performance of the device. Bandgaps may have values ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 eV, while HOMO levels can have values ranging from -5.5 to -4.8 eV. Efficiency enhancement initiatives, such as the invention of new donor- acceptor polymers and non-fullerene acceptors, have resulted to gains in power conversion efficiency (PCE), with values reaching 15%. These benefits have been achieved via the implementation of these tactics. Due to the fact that degradation processes have an effect on the performance of the device over time, stability concerns are very important for practical deployment. In order to improve the device's stability, encapsulation materials and stabilizing chemicals are used to reduce the number of breakdown routes. This paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in OPV technology by highlighting the significance of material selection, efficiency enhancement, and stability improvement for sustainable energy conversion. Performance evaluation metrics, such as fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc), indicate improved device performance. FF ranges from 60% to 70%, and Voc ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 V. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge. The optimization of materials and device designs should be the primary focus of future research efforts in order to significantly improve the performance of OPVs and speed up its deployment as a viable renewable energy alternative."
129,,2018.0,Degradation and outdoor performance monitoring of next generation solar cells for building integrated applications,"This thesis focuses on the manufacturing, indoor characterisation and outdoor monitoring of Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and Organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In order for emerging PV technologies to become commercially viable it is important that their performance under these conditions is defined. 
In this thesis, the outdoor performance parameters of PSCs and OPVs monitored over the course of several campaigns are reported and benchmarked against polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) solar cells. The data has been analysed in detail against solar irradiance dose, climatic conditions and stability. It was discovered that in common with poly-Si PVs, PSCs also exhibits a distinctive negative temperature coefficient across all performance parameters (VOC, ISC, FF and PCE) which decreases with increasing irradiation dose. In all outdoor campaigns the main causes for early-life degradation were noted to be sealant failure leading to oxygen and water ingress, although longer-term degradation has been observed and assigned to photo-oxidation which in some cases was effectively suppressed by the utilisation of UV filtering. 
The stability of PSCs and active layers was improved by the use of luminescent down-shifting coatings which were applied as a substitute to conventional UV filters. 
This thesis also demonstrates the benefit of multidirectional orientation of OPVs laminated onto an industrial building prototype for building-integrated applications. It is shown that positioning OPVs to more directions than South improves the overall diurnal yield and can potentially double the energy produced per year, in particular for peak generation hours in the UK. 
The benefit of unreacted lead iodide as partial filter to the highly damaging UV component of sunlight is shown. The importance of a thin residue lead iodide layer in PSCs shows an improvement in the stability of fabricated devices. 
One of the most significant findings in this thesis is the first report on the stability of perovskite absorber layers and solar cells conducted with irradiance levels at 1sun or 100sun concentrated natural sunlight. By accelerating the aging process, this method provides invaluable information about the long-term performance of absorber layers and devices which is an immense contribution to the PV community in improving the compositions and structure of PSCs. 
Abstract 
vi 
The stability of 3rd generation PV remains a critical issue preventing the appearance of these new and exciting, flexible and highly efficient PVs on the market. The last part of this thesis shows the second important finding in this thesis which focuses on an in-depth study of the stability of OPVs subjected to a multi-stress accelerated lifetime testing (ALT). This study is conducted indoors which facilitates the most destructive elements to the life of an OPV exposed outdoors to be clearly determined by exposing the modules to well-defined exposure conditions."
130,,2018.0,"Photo-degradation, thermal degradation and storage: the impact of the organic solar cell architecture on the degradation mechanisms","Understanding the degradation mechanisms in organic photovoltaics is a major issue in order to develop stable organic semi-conductors and robust device architectures. We investigated the role of the architecture of organic solar cells (OSC) in the stability of the device under different aging conditions. 
The impact of the light, especially the UV part of the solar spectrum, on the evolution of the photovoltaic characteristics of the inverted OSC devices was investigated. The results show that UV light induces an important Voc loss for several active layers. More importantly, we show that the type of electron transport layer (ETL) induces different degradation mechanisms. For TiOx-based devices, the formation of an interface dipole was identified, resulting in a loss of the flat-band potential (Vfb). For ZnO-based devices, chemical modifications of the metal oxide and active layer at the interface were detected, resulting in a doping of the active layer. 
The stability of inverted OSC under thermal stress was also investigated and the role played by the hole transport layer (HTL) material and metal electrode was examined. A roughening phenomenon of the silver electrode was detected upon thermal ageing. For sufficiently thick silver layers, this has no impact of the device stability. However, for devices with thin silver electrode, this de-wetting phenomenon leads to a complete failure of the solar cell due to the formation of gaps in the electrode. This problem can be overcome with the addition of a thin metal-oxide layer on top of the electrode. Using XPS depth profile, we also demonstrated the presence of inter-layer diffusion when silver is used as an electrode material. This inter-diffusion is correlated to declines in the performance of the device when used in conjunction with MoO3 as an HTL. 
The stability under storage in air of OSC in direct architecture was also investigated and we developed a novel strategy to replace the PEDOT:PSS. A poly(3-hexylthiophene) bearing a triethoxysilane function at the end of the chain (P3HT-Si) was anchored to the indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The use of this novel grafted HTL creates a hole selective membrane which drastically reduces the leakage current. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of OSC was improved compared to devices with bare ITO. By replacing PEDOT:PSS by the hydrophobic P3HT-Si, the water penetration in the device is impeded which significantly improved the shelf lifetime of devices. 
These different studies highlight the role of the architecture and, more specifically, of the ETL, HTL and electrode in the stability of OPV devices."

Various accelerated aging tests, i.e. heat aging, UV aging, damp-heat aging and combined UV / damp-heat aging, were performed on full-size PV modules from different PV module manufacturers. The climate-dependence of the degradation was investigated on identical PV modules which have been exposed in different extreme climates for up to six years. A comprehensive degradation analysis was performed, i.e. by means of power measurements, electroluminescence imaging and Raman spectroscopy.

The developed method can be utilized to determine drug content and its related substances. The method validation study proves that the method is accurate, precise, specific and robust. The imatinib mesilate has five specified impurities and can be easily determined using this methodology. All impurities and imatinib peak are resolved using XB ridge C18, 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm column.

133,,2024.0,Atomistic evolution of active sites in multi-component heterogeneous catalysts,"Multi-component metal nanoparticles (NPs) are of paramount importance in the chemical industry, as most processes therein employ heterogeneous catalysts. While these multi-component systems have been shown to result in higher product yields, improved selectivities, and greater stability through catalytic cycling, the structural dynamics of these materials in response to various stimuli (e.g. temperature, adsorbates, etc.) are not understood with atomistic resolution. Here, we present a highly accurate equivariant machine-learned force field (MLFF), constructed from ab initio training data collected using Bayesian active learning, that is able to reliably simulate PdAu surfaces and NPs in response to thermal treatment as well as exposure to reactive H$_2$ atmospheres. We thus provide a single model that is able to reliably describe the full space of geometric and chemical complexity for such a heterogeneous catalytic system across single crystals, gas-phase interactions, and NPs reacting with H$_2$, including catalyst degradation and explicit reactivity. Ultimately, we provide direct atomistic evidence that verifies existing experimental hypotheses for bimetallic catalyst deactivation under reaction conditions, namely that Pd preferentially segregates into the Au bulk through aggressive catalytic cycling and that this degradation is site-selective, as well as the reactivity for hydrogen exchange as a function of Pd ensemble size. We demonstrate that understanding of the atomistic evolution of these active sites is of the utmost importance, as it allows for design and control of material structure and corresponding performance, which can be vetted in silico."

Six kinds of cathode buffer layers, i.e. lithium fluoride, sodium chloride, NaCl/Mg, tris-(8-hydroxy-quinoline) aluminum, bathocuproine and 1,3,5-tris(2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene, were inserted between the photoactive layer and an Al cathode, which played a dominant role in the device’s performance. Devices with the cathode buffer layers above exhibited improved performance. The degradation of these devices with encapsulation was further investigated in an inert atmosphere. The results indicated that devices with inorganic cathode buffer layers exhibited better stability than those with organic cathode buffer layers."
135,10.3390/ijms18010164,2017.0,Comparative Solid-State Stability of Perindopril Active Substance vs. Pharmaceutical Formulation,"This paper presents the results obtained after studying the thermal stability and decomposition kinetics of perindopril erbumine as a pure active pharmaceutical ingredient as well as a solid pharmaceutical formulation containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Since no data were found in the literature regarding the spectroscopic description, thermal behavior, or decomposition kinetics of perindopril, our goal was the evaluation of the compatibility of this antihypertensive agent with the excipients in the tablet under ambient conditions and to study the effect of thermal treatment on the stability of perindopril erbumine. ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, thermal analysis (thermogravimetric mass curve (TG—thermogravimetry), derivative thermogravimetric mass curve (DTG), and heat flow (HF)) and model-free kinetics were chosen as investigational tools. Since thermal behavior is a simplistic approach in evaluating the thermal stability of pharmaceuticals, in-depth kinetic studies were carried out by classical kinetic methods (Kissinger and ASTM E698) and later with the isoconversional methods of Friedman, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa. It was shown that the main thermal degradation step of perindopril erbumine is characterized by activation energy between 59 and 69 kJ/mol (depending on the method used), while for the tablet, the values were around 170 kJ/mol. The used excipients (anhydrous colloidal silica, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, and magnesium stearate) should be used in newly-developed generic solid pharmaceutical formulations, since they contribute to an increased thermal stability of perindopril erbumine."
136,10.1002/aenm.202201267,2022.0,Strong Intermolecular Interactions Induced by High Quadrupole Moments Enable Excellent Photostability of Non‐Fullerene Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics,"Understanding degradation mechanisms of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is a critical prerequisite for improving device stability. Herein, the effect of molecular structure on the photostability of non‐fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is studied by changing end‐group substitution of ITIC derivatives: ITIC, ITIC‐2F, and ITIC‐DM. Using an assay of in situ spectroscopy techniques and molecular simulations, the photodegradation product of ITIC and the rate of product formation are identified, which correlates excellently to reported device stability, with ITIC‐2F being the most stable and ITIC‐DM the least. The choice of acceptor is found to affect both the donor polymer (PBDB‐T) photostability and the morphological stability of the bulk heterojunction blend. Molecular simulations reveal that NFA end‐group substitution strongly modulates the electron distribution within the molecule and thus its quadrupole moment. Compared to unsubstituted‐ITIC, end‐group fluorination results in a stronger, and demethylation a weaker, molecular quadrupole moment. This influences the intermolecular interactions between NFAs and between the NFA and the polymer, which in turn affects the photostability and morphological stability. This hypothesis is further tested on two other high quadrupole acceptors, Y6 and IEICO‐4F, which both show impressive photostability. The strong correlation observed between NFA quadrupole moment and photostability opens a new synthetic direction for photostable organic photovoltaic materials."
137,,2016.0,Local Imaging of Optoelectronic Properties and Film Degradation in Polymer/Fullerene Solar Cells with Electrostatic Force Microscopy,"Local Imaging of Optoelectronic Properties and Film Degradation in Polymer/Fullerene Solar Cells with Electrostatic Force Microscopy Phillip Alexander Cox Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor David S. Ginger Chemistry With power conversion efficiencies on the rise, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) hold promise as a next-generation thin-film solar technology. However, both device performance and stability are inextricably linked to local film structure. Methods capable of probing nanoscale electronic properties as a function of film structure are thus a crucial component of the rational design of efficient and robust devices. This dissertation describes the use of three scanning probe methods for studying local charge generation and photodegradation in polymer/fullerene solar cells. First, we show that time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM) is capable of resolving local photocurrent from sub-bandgap excitation down to attoampere level currents, a result unattainable by traditional contact-mode methods. We find that the local charging rates measured with trEFM are proportional to external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements made on completed devices, making trEFM images equivalent to local EQE maps across the entire solar spectrum. For both phase-segregated and well-mixed MDMO-PPV:PCBM film morphologies, we show that the local distribution of photocurrent is invariant to excitation wavelength, providing local evidence for the controversial result that the probability of generating separated charge carriers does not depend on whether excitons are formed at the singlet state or charge transfer state. Next, we describe how local dissipation imaging can be performed with commercially-available frequency-modulated electrostatic force microscopy (FM-EFM) and show that dissipation maps are highly sensitive to photo-oxidative effects in organic semiconductors. We show that photo-oxidation induced changes in cantilever energy dissipation are proportional to device performance losses. We further develop dissipation imaging by implementing ringdown imaging, which directly measures the quality factor of the cantilever, enabling quantitative dissipation mapping. Using organic photovoltaic materials as a testbed, we study macroscopic device degradation as a function of photooxidation for three different film morphologies. According to EQE measurements, we find that the stability of the macroscopic devices is very sensitive to processing conditions, with films processed with the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane being the most stable. At the microscopic level, we compare the evolution of cantilever power dissipation as a function of photochemical degradation for three different polymer/fullerene blend morphologies, and show that the evolution of local power dissipation correlates with device stability. Lastly, we show that cantilever power dissipation increases more rapidly over large fullerene aggregates than in well-mixed polymer/fullerene regions, suggesting that local photochemistry on the fullerene contributes strongly to the dissipation signal."
138,10.1002/aenm.202104018,2022.0,"Charge‐Selective, Narrow‐Gap Indium Arsenide Quantum Dot Layer for Highly Stable and Efficient Organic Photovoltaics","The past decade has seen a dramatic surge in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of next‐generation solution‐processed thin‐film solar cells rapidly closing the gap in PCE of commercially‐available photovoltaic (PV) cells. Yet the operational stability of such new PVs leaves a lot to be desired. Specifically, chemical reaction with absorbers via high‐energy photons transmitted through the typically‐adapted metal oxide electron transporting layers (ETLs), and photocatalytic degradation at interfaces are considered detrimental to the device performance. Herein, the authors introduce a device architecture using the narrow‐gap, Indium Arsenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) with discrete electronic states as an ETL in high‐efficiency solution‐processed PVs. High‐performing PM6:Y6 organic PVs (OPVs) achieve a PCE of 15.1%. More importantly, as the operating stability of the device is significantly improved, retaining above 80% of the original PCE over 1000 min under continuous illumination, a Newport‐certified PCE of 13.1% is reported for nonencapsulated OPVs measured under ambient air. Based on operando studies as well as optical simulations, it suggested that the InAs CQD ETLs with discrete energy states effectively cut‐off high‐energy photons while selectively collecting electrons from the absorber. The findings of this works enable high‐efficiency solution‐processed PVs with enhanced durability under operating conditions."
139,10.1002/adfm.202100151,2021.0,A Review on Encapsulation Technology from Organic Light Emitting Diodes to Organic and Perovskite Solar Cells,"Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing organic thin‐film based emitters have attracted tremendous attention due to their widespread applications in lighting and as displays in mobile devices and televisions. The novel thin‐film photovoltaic techniques using organic or organic–inorganic hybrid materials such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become emerging competitive candidates with regard to the traditional photovoltaic techniques on account of high‐efficiency, low‐cost, and simple manufacturing processing properties. However, OLEDs, OPVs, and PSCs are vulnerable to the undesired degradation induced by moisture and oxygen. To afford long‐term stability, a robust encapsulation technique by employing materials and structures that possess high barrier performance against oxygen and moisture must be explored and employed to protect these devices. Herein, the recent progress on specific encapsulation materials and techniques for three types of devices on the basis of fundamental understanding of device stability is reviewed. First, their degradation mechanisms, as well as, influencing factors are discussed. Then, the encapsulation technologies and materials are classified and discussed. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of various encapsulation technologies and materials coupled with their encapsulation applications in different devices are compared. Finally, the ongoing challenges and future perspectives of encapsulation frontier are provided."
140,10.1088/2058-8585/ac66ae,2022.0,"Fully solution-processed, light-weight, and ultraflexible organic solar cells","Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have the potential to be superior to other PV technologies for the use in applications that require very high flexibility or maximum specific power (power-per-weight ratio), such as textile integration, wearable electronics, or outer space applications. However, OPV devices also require encapsulation by barrier films to reduce the degradation driven by extrinsic factors, which in turn limits their flexibility and leads to lower specific power values. In this work, fully solution-processed (including both electrodes) semitransparent organic solar cells (OSCs) with performance comparable with conventional indium tin oxide-based devices are processed directly onto different barrier films of varying thicknesses. Direct cell fabrication onto barrier films leads to the elimination of the additional polyethylene terephthalate substrate and one of the two adhesive layers in the final stack of an encapsulated OPV device by replacing the industrial state-of-the-art sandwich encapsulation with a top-only encapsulation process, which yields significantly thinner and lighter ‘product-relevant’ PV devices. In addition to the increase of the specific power to 0.38 W g−1, which is more than four times higher than sandwich-encapsulated devices, these novel OSCs exhibit better flexibility and survive 5000 bending cycles with 4.5 mm bending radius. Moreover, the devices show comparable stability as conventionally encapsulated devices under constant illumination (1 sun) in ambient air for 1000 h. Finally, degradation under damp heat conditions (65 °C, 85% rh) was investigated and found to be determined by a combination of different factors, namely (UV) light soaking, intrinsic barrier properties, and potential damaging of the barriers during (laser) processing."

In this study, it is shown that constitutively active oncogenic fusion proteins that contain PDGF or FGF receptor moieties, caused by specific chromosomal translocations in chronic myeloid neoplasms, escape this negative regulatory mechanism. Background Chimeric oncogenes encoding constitutively active protein tyrosine kinases are associated with chronic myeloid neoplasms. TEL-PDGFRβ (TPβ, also called ETV6-PDGFRB) is a hybrid protein produced by the t(5;12) translocation, FIP1L1-PDGFRα (FPα) results from a deletion on chromosome 4q12 and ZNF198-FGFR1 is created by the t(8;13) translocation. These fusion proteins are found in patients with myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia. Wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases are efficiently targeted for degradation upon activation, in a process that requires Cbl-mediated monoubiquitination of receptor lysines. Since protein degradation pathways have been identified as useful targets for cancer therapy, the aim of this study was to compare the degradation of hybrid and wild-type receptor tyrosine kinases. Design and Methods We used Ba/F3 as a model cell line, as well as leukocytes from two patients, to analyze hybrid protein degradation. Results In contrast to the corresponding wild-type receptors, which are quickly degraded upon activation, we observed that TPβ, FPα and the ZNF198-FGFR1 hybrids escaped down-regulation in Ba/F3 cells. The high stability of TPβ and FPα hybrid proteins was confirmed in leukocytes from leukemia patients. Ubiquitination of TPβ and FPα was much reduced compared to that of wild-type receptors, despite marked Cbl phosphorylation in cells expressing hybrid receptors. The fusion of a destabilizing domain to TPβ induced protein degradation. Instability was reverted by adding the destabilizing domain ligand, Shield1. The destabilization of this modified TPβ reduced cell transformation and STAT5 activation. Conclusions We have shown that chimeric receptor tyrosine kinases escape ubiquitination and down-regulation and that their stabilization is critical to efficient stimulation of cell proliferation."

While there are no concerns about their efficiency, very little is known about their stability under illumination and load. Ionic defects and their migration in the perovskite crystal lattice are some of the most alarming sources of degradation, which can potentially prevent the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we provide direct evidence of electric field-induced ionic defect migration and we isolate their effect on the long-term performance of state-of-the-art devices. Supported by modelling, we demonstrate that ionic defects, migrating on timescales significantly longer (above 103 s) than what has so far been explored (from 10−1 to 102 s), abate the initial efficiency by 10–15% after several hours of operation at the maximum power point. Though these losses are not negligible, we prove that the initial efficiency is fully recovered when leaving the device in the dark for a comparable amount of time. We verified this behaviour over several cycles resembling day/night phases, thus probing the stability of PSCs under native working conditions. This unusual behaviour reveals that research and industrial standards currently in use to assess the performance and the stability of solar cells need to be adjusted for PSCs. Our work paves the way for much needed new testing protocols and figures of merit specifically designed for PSCs."

In addition, the photocatalytic mechanism of MGC was illustrated through modern characterization technology and density functional theory (DFT) computation. The findings of characterization (XRD, SEM-EDX, UV-Vis, XPS) confirmed that MGC was a composite photocatalyst of C3N4-graphite-MoS2 ternary structure, and displayed excellent visible light absorption performance. MGC photocatalyst exhibited the highest degradation efficiencies of MB than that of C3N4 and MoS2 catalyst, and it effectively improved the removal of pollutant. Also, the first-order reaction model suitably described the photocatalytic reaction process. The recycling experiments proved that MGC catalyst possessed remarkable photocatalytic stability in the degradation activities of MB, and the morphology maintained stable after three times of reusing. The ternary composite structure of MGC was conducive to the generation and transfer of the photo-generated electrons and photo-generated holes. Besides, MGC photocatalyst obtained the lowest photoluminescence spectrum intensity, which might decrease the combination probability of photo-induced electrons and holes. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis verified that the active radicals of •OH and •O2- measured in photocatalytic reaction probably played an essential part in the degradation of MB. Furthermore, through calculating the band structure, density of states (DOS), and work function, it was illustrated that the two opposite potential barriers forming between graphite, MoS2 and C3N interface effectively accelerated the division of photo-induced electrons and photo-induced holes in MoS2 and C3N4. Then, the recombination probability of photo-induced electrons and holes was reduced, and hence that greatly improved the photocatalytic efficiency of MB."
144,10.1021/bm100029t,2010.0,Polylactide stereocomplexation leads to higher hydrolytic stability but more acidic hydrolysis product pattern.,"Poly-l-lactide/poly-d-lactide (PLLA/PDLA) stereocomplex had much higher hydrolytic stability compared to plain PLLA, but at the same time shorter and more acidic degradation products were formed. Both materials were subjected to hydrolytic degradation in water and in phosphate buffer at 37 and 60 degrees C, and the degradation processes were monitored by following mass loss, water uptake, thermal properties, surface changes, and pH of the aging medium. The degradation product patterns were determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The high crystallinity and strong secondary interactions in the stereocomplex prevented water uptake and resulted in lower mass loss and degradation rate. However, somewhat surprisingly, the pH of the aging medium decreased much faster in the case of PLLA/PDLA stereocomplex. In accordance, the ESI-MS results showed that hydrolysis of PLLA/PDLA resulted in shorter and more acidic degradation products. This could be explained by the increased intermolecular crystallization due to stereocomplexation, which results in an increased number of tie chains. Because mainly these short tie chains are susceptible to hydrolysis this leads to formation of shorter oligomers compared to hydrolysis of regular PLLA."

The proposed ACL enhances the microwave magnetic field (B1) stability over the whole VCO frequency sweep range, against different sample environments and at varying experimental conditions. By introducing a distributed amplitude detection scheme, the proposed ACL implementation can regulate B1 field intensities in injection-locked VCO arrays with reduced loading effects and minimal phase noise degradation. Extracted-level circuit simulations on an example VCO array implementation demonstrate the functionality and excellent achievable performance of the proposed approach."
146,10.1021/acsami.3c01779,2023.0,Flexible Solution-Processed Electron-Transport-Layer-Free Organic Photovoltaics for Indoor Application.,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have unique advantages of low weight, mechanical flexibility, and solution processability, which make them exceptionally suitable for integrating low-power Internet of Things devices. However, achieving improved operational stability together with solution processes that are applicable to large-scale fabrication remains challenging. Their major limitation arises due to the instable factors that occur both inside the thick active film and from the ambient environment, which cannot be completely resolved via the current encapsulation techniques used for flexible OPVs. Additionally, thin active layers are highly vulnerable to point defects, which result in low yield rates and impede the laboratory-to-industry translation. In this study, flexible fully solution-processed OPVs with improved indoor efficiency and long-term operational stability than that of conventional OPVs with evaporated electrodes are achieved. Benefiting from the oxygen and water vapor permeation barrier of the spontaneously formed gallium oxide layers on the exposed eutectic gallium-indium surface, fast degradation of the OPVs with thick active layers is prevented, maintaining 93% of its initial Pmax after 5000 min of indoor operation under 1000 lx light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. Additionally, by using the thick active layer, spin-coated silver nanowires could be directly used as bottom electrodes without complicated flattening processes, thereby substantially simplifying the fabrication process and proposing a promising manufacturing technique for devices with high-throughput energy demands."
147,10.1021/bm401667b,2013.0,Tuning the Degradation Profiles of Poly(l-lactide)-Based Materials through Miscibility,"The effective use of biodegradable polymers relies on the ability to control the onset of and time needed for degradation. Preferably, the material properties should be retained throughout the intended time frame, and the material should degrade in a rapid and controlled manner afterward. The degradation profiles of polyester materials were controlled through their miscibility. Systems composed of PLLA blended with poly[(R,S)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (a-PHB) and polypropylene adipate (PPA) with various molar masses were prepared through extrusion. Three different systems were used: miscible (PLLA/a-PHB5 and PLLA/a-PHB20), partially miscible (PLLA/PPA5/comp and PLLA/PPA20/comp), and immiscible (PLLA/PPA5 and PLLA/PPA20) blends. These blends and their respective homopolymers were hydrolytically degraded in water at 37 °C for up to 1 year. The blends exhibited entirely different degradation profiles but showed no diversity between the total degradation times of the materials. PLLA presented a two-stage degradation profile with a rapid decrease in molar mass during the early stages of degradation, similar to the profile of PLLA/a-PHB5. PLLA/a-PHB20 presented a single, constant linear degradation profile. PLLA/PPA5 and PLLA/PPA20 showed completely opposing degradation profiles relative to PLLA, exhibiting a slow initial phase and a rapid decrease after a prolonged degradation time. PLLA/PPA5/comp and PLLA/PPA20/comp had degradation profiles between those of the miscible and the immiscible blends. The molar masses of the materials were approximately the same after 1 year of degradation despite their different profiles. The blend composition and topographical images captured at the last degradation time point demonstrate that the blending component was not leached out during the period of study. The hydrolytic stability of degradable polyester materials can be tailored to obtain different and predetermined degradation profiles for future applications."

Microencapsulation of volatile ingredients prior to use in food or beverages is a commonly used process to limit loss and degradation of flavours and aromas during processing and storage. Here, peppermint essential oil was microencapsulated via complex coacervation using a combination of bovine serum albumin and gum Acacia as wall materials. The resulting core-shell microcapsules were chemically crosslinked with a modified food-grade starch, and subsequently spray dried, resulting in dry microcapsules which could be easily redispersed in aqueous solutions. Microcapsule formation and stability, as well as microencapsulation yield of peppermint oil, were investigated as a function of polymer concentration, core material load/wall thickness and crosslinker concentration. The crosslinked peppermint oil microcapsules were spherical and mononuclear both before and after spray drying and redispersion, whereas control coacervate samples without crosslinker did not withstand the spray drying process. Microencapsulation yield as analysed by GC-MS showed no loss of peppermint oil during or after complex coacervation, and 54% loss after spray drying for the best combination of Polymer:Oil ratio and crosslinker concentration used here, indicating good overall protection of the core material."

They switch fast with turnoffs from semi saturated state without current tails and have the same time extremely low saturated UCE values. SiC SBJT's without bipolar degradation were fabricated and packaged in TO-247 packages. The BJT's fabricated were characterized both statically and dynamically in a setup similar to a switching application, as well as tested for stability. A SPICE model was developed and simulations of the switching transitions were done and compared to measurements. Simulations of a boost converter were also done to show the efficiency improvements of a complete system made possible using this type of transistors."

This study reports the first use of quasi-simultaneous operando pair distribution function (PDF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of a battery cell, providing a detailed, atomic-level understanding of the cycling mechanism of Bi2MoO6 as an anode material for Na-ion batteries. This material cycles via a combined conversion-alloying reaction, where electrochemically active, nanocrystalline NaxBi particles embedded in an amorphous Na–Mo–O matrix are formed during the first sodiation. The combination of operando PDF and XAS revealed that Bi obtains a positive oxidation state at the end of desodiation, due to formation of Bi–O bonds at the interface between the Bi particles and the Na–Mo–O matrix. In addition, XAS confirmed that Mo has an average oxidation state of +6 throughout the (de)sodiation process and, thus, does not contribute to the capacity. However, the local environment of Mo6+ changes from tetrahedral coordination in the desodiated state to distorted octahedral in the sodiated state. These structural changes are linked to the poor cycling stability of Bi2MoO6, as flexibility of this matrix allows movement and coalescence of the NaxBi particles, which is detrimental to the electrochemical stability."
151,10.1002/aenm.201803755,2019.0,Twist and Degrade—Impact of Molecular Structure on the Photostability of Nonfullerene Acceptors and Their Photovoltaic Blends,"Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) dominate organic photovoltaic (OPV) research due to their promising efficiencies and stabilities. However, there is very little investigation into the molecular processes of degradation, which is critical to guiding design of novel NFAs for long‐lived, commercially viable OPVs. Here, the important role of molecular structure and conformation in NFA photostability in air is investigated by comparing structurally similar but conformationally different promising NFAs: planar O‐IDTBR and nonplanar O‐IDFBR. A three‐phase degradation process is identified: i) initial photoinduced conformational change (i.e., torsion about the core–benzothiadiazole dihedral), induced by noncovalent interactions with environmental molecules, ii) followed by photo‐oxidation and fragmentation, leading to chromophore bleaching and degradation product formation, and iii) finally complete chromophore bleaching. Initial conformational change is a critical prerequisite for further degradation, providing fundamental understanding of the relative stability of IDTBR and IDFBR, where the already twisted IDFBR is more prone to degradation. When blended with the donor polymer poly(3‐hexylthiophene), both NFAs exhibit improved photostability while the photostability of the polymer itself is significantly reduced by the more miscible twisted NFA. The findings elucidate the important role of NFA molecular structure in photostability of OPV systems, and provide vital insights into molecular design rules for intrinsically photostable NFAs."

Two-dimensional (2D) perovskite analogues feature greater stability toward environmental factors, such as moisture, owing to a hydrophobic organic cation that acts as a spacer between the inorganic layers, which offers a significant advantage over their comparatively less stable 3D analogues. Here, we demonstrate the first example of a formamidinium (FA) containing Dion-Jacobson 2D perovskite material characterized by the BFA n-1Pb nI3 n+1 formulation through employing a novel bifunctional organic spacer (B), namely 1,4-phenylenedimethanammonium (PDMA). We achieve remarkable efficiencies exceeding 7% for (PDMA)FA2Pb3I10 based 2D perovskite solar cells resisting degradation when exposed to humid ambient air, which opens up new avenues in the design of stable perovskite materials."

Edentulous patients with involuntary movements of facial muscles (such as hemifacial spasm) could encounter difficulties in maintaining the stability of their dentures. Not only would the proper and effective occlusion of thedentures be adversely affected, the harmony and compatibility with surrounding tissues (critical factors to be considered in any effort to fabricate a stable set of dentures) could be significantly degraded.

The dinucleotide was subjected to ammonolysis and other basic conditions such as treatment with ethylenediamine and sodium hydroxide at different temperatures. The amide of the carbamoylmethyl group partially hydrolyzed under standard deprotection conditions for oligonucleotide synthesis (conc. aq. NH3 at 55 °C). However, under several other conditions, including saturated NH3 in methanol, the amide remained intact. Treatment of the dinucleotide with Phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus adamanteus venom and Phosphodiesterase II from Bovine spleen, showed that the carbamoylmethyl moiety gives substantial protection of the phosphodiester towards enzymatic degradation."

The OPVC utilized fullerene (C60) as the electron acceptor, ITO‐coated glass as the anode, and aluminum as the cathode. Hybrid electrode buffer layers of MoO3/CuI on the anode side and of Alq3/Ca on the cathode side were used. This shows the effectiveness of the bilayer Alq3/Ca as a cathode buffer layer. The thickness of the Ca layer and its effect on the performance and lifetime of the OPVCs were studied. It was found that an Alq3/Ca structure with 6 nm of Alq3 and 3 nm of Ca has an efficiency (η) of 2.28%, while a device without Ca has an efficiency of only 1.47%. Combining an optimized thickness of the new donor BSTV (22 nm) together with the bilayer cathode buffer layer, a device having an open‐circuit voltage, Voc of 0.84 V, a short‐circuit current, Jsc of 3.60 mA cm−2, and a fill factor, FF of 50% was achieved. However, the efficiency of the OPV with Ca decreases rapidly during the first hours of air exposure, resulting in device performance that is similar to a device fabricated without Ca. After this initial degradation, device performance for both types of OPV evolves similarly with continued air exposure."

The 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) photocatalytic degradation in aqueous suspension was used as a probe reaction. Commercial anatase TiO2 was impregnated with home-prepared double-decker phthalocyanine complexes of the lanthanide metals, such as Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Ho, and Gd.

Citral, linalool, beta-myrcene, limonene, and beta-pinene were used at concentrations of 10, 20, and 30% with respect to the wall material. The greatest percentages of retention occurred at a concentration of 10%. Linalool and citral presented the greatest losses with increase in concentration. The hydrocarbons used were the most retained. Of the hydrocarbons, beta-pinene was better retained in the capsules than limonene, and beta-myrcene was the least retained of all. The capsules presented similar external morphologies, with no apparent cracks or porosity and an average size varying between 15.7 and 23.2 microm. The stability of the capsules to temperature was monitored for 33 days. The degradation products of the monoterpenes were evaluated. The results indicated a greater stability of the capsules containing beta-pinene and citral than of those containing linalool and beta-myrcene presenting the lowest retentions."
159,,2014.0,In vitro enzymatic degradation of lipidified apomorphine,"SUMMARY Lipophilic diester derivatives of apomorphine were synthesized and purified using column chromatography. The extent of intestinal enzymatic degradation of the diester mediated predominantly by pancreatic lipase was assessed in vitro. The potential of lipids to protect against the enzymatic degradation of apomorphine diester is currently being investigated. INTRODUCTION Apomorphine is administered subcutaneously for Parkinson’s disease, as the compound undergoes significant first-pass metabolism upon oral administration. It possesses short half-life causing a need for frequent administration and thus leading to problems with patient compliance 1 . A possible strategy to overcome this may be to develop a lipid based oral delivery system for apomorphine by synthesizing its lipophilic prodrugs. The lipidified apomorphine administered with lipids may have a potential to stimulate the lymphatic transport and thereby, avoid the first pass metabolism. The aim of this study was to synthesize and purify diesters of apomorphine using fatty acid chloride and apomorphine as well as to investigate in vitro enzymatic stability in fasted state simulating intestinal fluids (FaSSIF). EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Apomorphine diesters were synthesized based on the method reported by Borgman et al 2 with some modifications. Apomorphine HCl·1⁄2H2O was dissolved in trifluroacetic acid and treated with an excess of the appropriate acid chloride. The mixture was warmed on a water bath for 6-7 h (65°C), followed by the removal of volatiles under reduced pressure. After liquid-liquid extraction to remove excess of trifluoroacetic acid, the crude product was purified by column chromatography with ethyl acetate:heptane (1:1) with 5% triethylamine. The fractions containing product were collected and the purity was assessed and confirmed by using LC-MS and NMR. The in vitro degradation experiments were based on previously reported method with some modifications 4 . It was performed using 5mL FaSSIF, which was prepared by using bile salts (3mM), phospholipids (0.75 mM), sodium chloride (68 mM) and maleate (20 mM, pH 6.5). Dilauroyl apomorphine (C12 diester) was used in these experiments. The diester was dissolved either in 200μL ethanol without oil or in 100mg soybean oil and 200μL ethanol. The degradation was initiated by addition of pancreatin to yield pancreatic lipase activity of 550U/mL with stirring at 37°C. Samples were collected before addition of enzyme, and 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min after; and further degradation of diester in samples was inhibited with an immediate dilution in organic solvent. The amount of diester was quantified by HPLC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Two apomorphine alkyl diesters were synthesized containing either a C12 or C16 chain. The purity and mass were confirmed by NMR and LC-MS. The structure and MS spectrum of dilauroyl apomorphine (C12 diester) is shown in Fig.1. The diester product was found to be free from the reactants (apomorphine and fatty acid chloride), free fatty acids and monoesters as impurities.

For such applications long term stability of the superconducting parameters is essential, especially the critical temperature and the transition width. Our analysis of the effect of film oxidation on these parameters for Mo/AuPd bilayers shows that even slight oxidation will have a significant effect.

Comparison with LixNi1.02O2 and LixNi0.89Al0.16O2,"The thermal degradation mechanism of LixNi0.70Co0.15Al0.15O2 and LixNi0.90Mn0.10O2 (x = 0.50 and 0.30) was studied by thermal gravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry. Correlation with in situ X-ray diffraction experiments was then achieved to determine the degradation mechanism and to explain the differences in thermal stability observed depending on the material composition. The degradation occurs in two steps:  a first transition between the lamellar phase and a spinel-type phase, and then a second transition between the pseudo-spinel phase and a NiO-type phase through a highly disordered R3m phase. Comparison of the thermal stability of the four materials shows that the addition of cobalt in the aluminum partial substituted materials improves the stability, particularly during the first step. The manganese partial substitution for nickel appears to improve the stability of the pseudo-spinel-type phase in comparison with LixNiO2 phases. The general thermal behavior of these deintercalated m..."

The morphological study illustrated that Fe2O3 nanoparticles were dispersed and embedded well within the PCL matrix. The size of Fe2O3 nanoparticles were below 250 nm. The thermal stability of Fe2O3/PCL nanocomposites was lower than neat PCL, which might be due to Fe2O3 (act as catalyst during the thermal degradation of PCL). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses show that the crystallization temperature of the nanocomposites was slightly enhanced as compared to neat PCL. The polarized optical microscopy (POM) analyses showed that the size of Fe2O3/PCL nanocomposites spherulites were smaller than neat PCL. The photodegradation study presented that the nanocomposites photodegraded higher quantity of rhodamine B dye as compared to neat PCL. The neat PCL degraded about 24 and 72% while Fe2O3 (6 wt%)/PCL nanocomposites degraded about 72 and 98% of dye within 2 and 10 h, respectively."

To directly evaluate the role of individual oligosaccharides in the secretion of IgA, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to selectively eliminate the two N-linked attachment sites reported to be glycosylated in alpha heavy chains. Transfected wild-type and mutant alpha genes were expressed in kappa light-chain-producing MPC-11 variant myeloma cells, and secretion kinetics of the IgAs were compared. Removal of either or both glycosylation sites led to intracellular alpha heavy-chain degradation and a 90 to 95% inhibition of IgA secretion. These results reveal that both N-linked oligosaccharides of the alpha heavy chain are essential for intracellular stability and normal secretion of IgA. This suggests that the key function of carbohydrate here is to maintain proper conformation of the glycoprotein. We also found that when expressed in the MPC-11 variant cells, alpha heavy chains were glycosylated at a third, normally unused site."

Incorporation of high levels of α-tocopherol into LDPE film was found to inhibit oxidation of a linoleic acid emulsion stored in contact with the film at 6°C. However, the presence of 360 ppm caused changes in mechanical properties and an increase in oxygen transmission. Levels as high as 3400 ppm α-tocopherol also caused yellowing and reduction in crystallinity of the material. Thus, the use of high amounts of α-tocopherol in LDPE, which might be needed in active packaging applications, requires careful consideration of the protective requirements for each specific food and the maintenance of the desired properties of the packaging material.

The human enzyme was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography, and the active fractions contained a protein that was detected with antibodies shown to recognize E. coli RNase E. RNA containing four repeats of the destabilizing motif AUUUA and RNA from the 3' untranslated region of human c-myc mRNA were also found to be cleaved by E. coli RNase E and its human counterpart in a fashion that may suggest a role of this activity in mammalian mRNA decay. It was also found that RNA containing more than one AUUUA motif was cleaved more efficiently than RNA with only one or a mutated motif. This finding of a eukaryotic endoribonucleolytic activity corresponding to RNase E indicates an evolutionary conservation of the components of mRNA degradation systems."
166,10.1002/cphc.201402749,2015.0,Methods for improving the lifetime performance of organic photovoltaics with low-costing encapsulation.,"Recent years have seen considerable advances in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), most notably a significant increase in their efficiency, from around 4 % to over 10 %. The stability of these devices, however, continues to remain an issue that needs to be resolved to enable their commercialization. This review discusses the main degradation processes of OPVs and recent methods that help to increase device stability and lifetime. One of the most effective steps that can be taken to increase the lifetime of OPVs is their encapsulation, which protects them from atmospheric degradation. Efficient encapsulation is essential for long-term device performance, but it is equally important for the commercialization of OPVs to strike a balance between achieving the maximum device protection possible and using low-cost processing for their encapsulation. Various encapsulation techniques are discussed herein, with emphasis on their cost effectiveness and their overall suitability for commercial applications."

The UV spectrum was scanned between 200 to 400 nm and 270.5 nm was selected as maximum wavelength for absorption. Beer’s law was obeyed in the concentration range of 10(80 *g/ml. Good accuracy (100.18(100.26%), precision (%RSD 0.997(0.995) were found, the method was successfully applied to the pharmaceutical dosage form containing the above(mentioned drug without any interference by the excipients. Results of the analysis were validated as per ICH guidelines. Forced degradation studies includes the effect of temperature, oxidation, photolysis and susceptibility to hydrolysis across a wide range of pH values, were carried out according to the ICH requirements which can be used for the routine and quality control analysis of Atomoxetine hydrochloride in raw material and pharmaceutical formulations."

Consequently, one of the most important unsolved issues facing a new industry is understanding what governs lifetime in organic devices and discovering solutions to mitigate degradation mechanisms. Historically, the active organic components are considered vulnerable to photo-oxidation and represent the primary degradation channel. However, we present several (shelf life and light soaking) studies pointing the relative stability of the active layers and instabilities in commonly used electrode materials. We show that engineering of the hole/electron layer at the electrode can lead to environmentally stable devices even without encapsulation."

The corresponding H-phosphonate building block was also synthesised, and from this intermediate, a 2′-O-[N-(aminoethyl)carbamoyl]methyl-containing dinucleotide could be made. We also performed studies on the chemical and enzymatic stability of this dinucleotide. The dinucleotide was subjected to different ammonolysis and other basic conditions, and HPLC analysis showed that the modification was intact to most conditions, but that there was some minor hydrolysis when NH3 (concd. aq.) was used at 55 °C. Under several other sets of conditions, including saturated NH3 in methanol, and ethylenediamine, the amide remained intact. Treatment of the dinucleotide with Phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus adamanteus venom and Phosphodiesterase II from bovine spleen showed that the N-(aminoethyl)carbamoylmethyl moiety gives the phosphodiester linkage substantial protection against enzymatic degradation; the phosphodiester was not degraded by PDE II at all after seven days."

After 7 days in culture, the cells were stimulated for 24 h with noradrenaline, and a high level of thermogenin mRNA was then observed. If noradrenaline treatment was continued, the mRNA level remained high, but, upon withdrawal of noradrenaline, the level decreased rapidly, with a half-life of only 2.7 h. The presence of transcriptional (actinomycin) or translational (cycloheximide) inhibitors prolonged the apparent half-life by about 50%. The presence of noradrenaline during transcriptional blockade led to a further stabilization of thermogenin mRNA. It was concluded that an induced (or short-lived) gene product is important for thermogenin mRNA degradation. Direct interaction of noradrenaline with the cultured brown adipocytes could apparently not mimic the paradoxical destabilization of thermogenin mRNA in vivo, previously observed in the cold-exposed mouse [Jacobsson, Cannon and Nedergaard (1987) FEBS Lett. 244, 353-356], indicating significant differences between the systems in vitro and in vivo."

For cell internalization a specific cell system, highly expressing the scavenger receptor LOX-1 was used. The results indicate that LOX-1 binds and internalizes a broad family of DNA structures of different sizes that, however, have a different fate and lifetime inside the cells. Covalently linked tetrahedra, octahedra or chainmails are intact inside cells for up to 18 hours whilst the same DNA nanostructures without covalent bonds along with square box and rectangular origami are rapidly degraded. These data suggest that non-covalently linked structures may be useful for fast drug release whilst the covalently-linked structures could be appropriate vehicles for slow release of molecules."

The main problem with their durability is the chemical degradation of the active polymers used as material transport layers, photoactive layers, membranes, etc., for the device functions, mainly caused by detrimental radical species from unwanted side reactions. Introducing additives that scavenge radicals before their attack of the device‐configuring polymers is one of the promising strategies to significantly improve their life. In particular, Ce‐based radical scavengers including free Ce3+ are considered to be highly efficient radical scavengers, with a rapid and regenerative redox reaction. However, those radical scavengers possess detrimental interaction with the active materials in the devices, which hinders charge carrier and material transport for the device function, thereby reducing the device efficiency. Herein, an organometallic complex of Ce3+ is applied, and is coordinated by dipicolinate ligands as a radical scavenger for the chemical stability of polymers employed and durability enhancement in fuel cell and organic photovoltaic (OPV) device applications. Owing to the stabilizing effect of dipicolinate ligands toward Ce3+, disadvantageous interaction between radical scavenger and polymer material is suppressed, which results in the improved device stability without reducing the initial performance."
173,10.1080/02726351.2013.769470,2013.0,"Organic Solar Cells: A Review of Materials, Limitations, and Possibilities for Improvement","Significant attention has been given during the last few years to overcome technological and material barriers in order to develop organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) with comparable cost efficiency similar to the inorganic photovoltaics (PVs) and to make them commercially viable. To take advantage of the low cost for such devices, major improvements are necessary which include: an efficiency of around 10%, high stability from degradation under real-world conditions, novel optically active materials, and development of novel fabrication approaches. In order to meet such stringent requirements, the research and development in OPVs need to improve upon the short diffusion length of excitons, which is one of the factors that are responsible for their low power conversion efficiency. This review discusses some of the most significant technological developments that were presented in the literature and helped improve photovoltaic performance, such as tandem architectures, plasmonics, and use of graphitic nanostructural materials, among others. Tandem organic solar cells with embedded plasmonics are a promising approach to further increase the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells, by harvesting complementary spectral regions with high quantum efficiencies. Polymeric nanocomposites incorporating graphitic nanostructures were extensively investigated for the next generation of efficient and low-cost solar cells, since such nanomaterials show excellent electrical and mechanical properties, excellent carrier transport capabilities, and provide an efficient pathway to the dissociated charge carriers."
174,,2010.0,"Production, Characterization and Stability of Organic Solar Cell Devices","Despite the fact that the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is in a rapid progress, organic solar cells continue taking backstage roll in the growing markets of various solar technologies. The main challenge of the field is to develop devices that would possess all the optimal properties required for efficient, stable and cheap solar cells, i.e. devices that can deliver high photoconversion efficiencies and long lifetimes and can be efficiently produced in large scales using roll-to-roll coating technologies. This dissertation is primarily devoted to the issues of photoconversion efficiency and device lifetimes. In particular, descriptions of some practical approaches for different device designs and processing of active layer for typical small scale OPV devices were presented. The emphasis was put on some optimizing techniques for processing of active layer that can significantly improve the device photoconversion efficiency. The techniques were further applied for manufacturing and characterization of solar cell devices based on various materials. In particular, a number of thermocleavable polymers were studied and devices based on such materials were produced and characterized. The applicability of such materials in photovoltaic devices was shown and further challenges were discussed. Another task of this work was to manufacture and study inverted device structures and compare their properties with normal structure based devices. Device based on both structure were successfully produced with same level of performance in terms of photoconversion efficiency, yet with totally different stability performance. As another task, metal oxides, such as MoO3 or V2O5 were studied in solar cell devices as buffer layers instead of PEDOT:PSS. Although the device efficiencies obtained with metal oxides were inferior to PEDOT based device, it was shown that such materials can possibly improve the device efficiency if the processing of the layers is optimized. The final part of the work is devoted to the issue of stability. In particular, a setup comprising an atmospheric chamber was presented for efficient lifetime evaluation of OPV devices and examples of exploitation of the setup were shown. Lifetime studies of various thermocleavable polymers were carried out and compared to commonly used thiophene based polymers. Comparative degradation studies were carried out for normal and inverted device structures under different atmospheric conditions, which revealed different degrading features for different structures. While the normal geometry devices were rather stable in oxygen and rapidly degraded in"
175,10.1021/acssynbio.8b00279,2018.0,A System for Gene Expression Noise Control in Yeast,"Gene expression noise arises from stochastic variation in the synthesis and degradation of mRNA and protein molecules and creates differences in protein numbers across populations of genetically identical cells. Such variability can lead to imprecision and reduced performance of both native and synthetic networks. In principle, gene expression noise can be controlled through the rates of transcription, translation and degradation, such that different combinations of those rates lead to the same protein concentrations but at different noise levels. Here, we present a “noise tuner” which allows orthogonal control over the transcription and the mRNA degradation rates by two different inducer molecules. Combining experiments with theoretical analysis, we show that in this system the noise is largely determined by the transcription rate whereas mean expression can be independently adjusted by mRNA stability. This noise tuner enables twofold changes in gene expression noise over a fivefold range of mean protein levels. We demonstrated the efficacy of the noise tuner in a complex regulatory network by varying gene expression noise in the mating pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which allowed us to control the output noise and the mutual information transduced through the pathway. The noise tuner thus represents an effective tool of gene expression noise control, both to interrogate noise sensitivity of natural networks and enhance performance of synthetic circuits."
176,10.15252/embj.201693889,2016.0,FBW7 suppression leads to SOX9 stabilization and increased malignancy in medulloblastoma,"SOX9 is a master transcription factor that regulates development and stem cell programs. However, its potential oncogenic activity and regulatory mechanisms that control SOX9 protein stability are poorly understood. Here, we show that SOX9 is a substrate of FBW7, a tumor suppressor, and a SCF (SKP1/CUL1/F‐box)‐type ubiquitin ligase. FBW7 recognizes a conserved degron surrounding threonine 236 (T236) in SOX9 that is phosphorylated by GSK3 kinase and consequently degraded by SCFFBW7α. Failure to degrade SOX9 promotes migration, metastasis, and treatment resistance in medulloblastoma, one of the most common childhood brain tumors. FBW7 is either mutated or downregulated in medulloblastoma, and in cases where FBW7 mRNA levels are low, SOX9 protein is significantly elevated and this phenotype is associated with metastasis at diagnosis and poor patient outcome. Transcriptional profiling of medulloblastoma cells expressing a degradation‐resistant SOX9 mutant reveals activation of pro‐metastatic genes and genes linked to cisplatin resistance. Finally, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity destabilizes SOX9 in a GSK3/FBW7‐dependent manner, rendering medulloblastoma cells sensitive to cytostatic treatment."

A new, sensitive, stability-indicating, and cost and time-effective isocratic reversed-phase UHPLC method has been developed for quantitative analysis of felbamate, an antiepileptic drug, both in the bulk drug and in pharmaceutical dosage forms. Chromatographic separation of felbamate and its two impurities was achieved on a C18 column with a simple buffer–methanol mobile phase; the run time was 8 min. Quantification was achieved by ultraviolet detection. Resolution between the impurities was >2.0. Response was a linear function of concentration over the range 0.1–3.0 μg mL−1, correlation coefficient >0.999, for felbamate and the impurities. The method is capable of detecting the two impurities at levels of 0.002% (0.02 μg mL−1) of the test concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 (1 μL injection). The same sensitivity was achieved for all the degradation products formed during stress studies in which the drug was subjected to hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis, and thermal degradation. Substantial degradation occurred under acidic and basic conditions. The stressed test solutions were assayed against felbamate working standard and the mass balance in each case was close to 100%, indicating the method is stability-indicating. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness in accordance with ICH Guidelines."

However to translate this promising efficiency to economically viable applications, long term stability is a fundamental requirement. A number of degradation pathways, both extrinsic and intrinsic, reduce the long term stability of OPVs. Here, the photovoltaic properties of a highly efficient bulk heterojunction PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend were investigated as a function of ex situ thermal annealing. The changes in charge generation, separation, and transport due to thermal annealing were measured and related to changes in the microstructure and photovoltaic performance. A 30% drop in the power conversion efficiency of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends upon thermal annealing at 150 °C was identified as mainly due to morphological instability induced by strong phase separation of donor and acceptor molecules of the blend films. Based on the insight gained from these investigations, enhanced thermal stability was demonstrated by replacing the PC71BM fullerene acceptor with a non-fullerene acceptor ITIC, for which power conversion efficiency dropped only by 9% upon thermal annealing at 150 °C."

Recent approaches to improve mechanical durability involve modifying the side-chain or main-chain structures of conjugated polymers in the active layer, but in general it is difficult to simultaneously optimize electronic properties, morphology, and mechanical stability. Here, we present a general approach to improve the mechanical stability of bulk heterojunction active layers through incorporation of an internal elastic network. Network-stabilized bulk heterojunction OPVs are prepared using reactive small molecular additives that are rapidly cross-linked through thiol–ene coupling after processing the active layer. Thiol–ene reactions catalyzed by a base or initiated through short exposure to UV light produce insoluble, elas..."
180,10.3390/ELECTRONICMAT2020016,2021.0,On the Role of LiF in Organic Optoelectronics,"Organic optoelectronic device behaviour is heavily dependent on interfacial effects due to the device architecture and thickness. Interfaces between the inorganic electrodes and the active organic layers play a defining role in the all of the electronic and stability processes that occur in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic solar cells (OPVs). Amongst the many interlayers introduced at these interfaces to improve charge carrier movement and stability, LiF has proven to be the most successful and it is almost ubiquitous in all organic semiconductor devices. Implemented at both top and bottom contact interfaces, doped into the charge transporting layers, and used as encapsulants, LiF has played major roles in device performance and lifetime. This review highlights the use of LiF at both top and bottom contacts in organic optoelectronics, discusses the various mechanisms proposed for the utility of LiF at each interface, and explores its impact on device lifetimes. From examples relating to charge carrier flow, interfacial electronic level modification, and interfacial stability, a comprehensive picture of the role of LiF in organic devices can be formed. This review begins with a brief overview of the role of the interface in OLEDs and OPVs, and the general properties of LiF. Then, it discusses the implementation of LiF at the top contact electrode interface, followed by the bottom substrate contact electrode, examining both performance and degradation effects in both cases."

In the operation of a permanent magnet synchronous motor, the nonlinearly parameterized-uncertainties degrade control performances, causing the instability of motor speed and output torques. Based on the analysis of temperature effects and friction torque model, a composite controller is proposed in this paper which considers model uncertainties and external disturbances. An adaptive controller involving an online time-varying scaling gain is employed to eliminate the influence of nonlinearly parameterized-uncertainties. In addition, an extended state observer (ESO) is used to estimate the disturbance in the control system in which the estimated value is used to compensate for the feed-forward. Numerical simulation and experiment are performed and the results show that the proposed method may alleviate the performance degradation due to nonlinearly parameterized-uncertainties and disturbances. Simultaneously, it may improve the stability and anti-disturbance capacities of the system."

Liu (1) reported fluoride emission rates (FER) with varying time dependencies, related to the operating conditions. Aarhaug (2) has shown that OCV conditions causes decaying FER, while an on/off cycle according to FCTestNet (3) resulted in increasing FER. Sulfur emission rates (SER) in combination with FER offers possible information about sidechain versus backbone attack on the ionomer. Inaba (4) reported FER and SER for Fenton testing of chemical stability, but data for effluent analysis data are scarce. Aarhaug (5) has shown that high concentrations of sulfate in the MEA from production processes need be removed prior to effluent analysis."

Ceria is used as an oxygen storage component in automotive exhaust emission control systems, but the degradation of its oxygen storage capacity (OSC) after extended use at high temperatures has been a problem. Our results for the first time establish a direct correlation between the concentration of vacancy-interstitial oxygen defects and OSC. The surface area, on the other hand, exhibits much less correlation with OSC. The results also show that zirconia, which is known to retard the degradation when incorporated into ceria, reduces ceria and preserves oxygen defects. It is suggested that oxygen defects are the source of OSC in ceria-based catalyst supports, and the preservation of oxygen defects is critical for the stability of OSC against thermal aging."

Except for pain at the site of injection, which disappeared after a few hr., no serious side reactions could be detected. The drug can be stored for 5 years at 5° with less than 7 per cent decomposition. The decomposition products were found to be less toxic than the unchanged oxime.

185,10.1039/c5cp00283d,2015.0,Direct observation of the dealloying process of a platinum-yttrium nanoparticle fuel cell cathode and its oxygenated species during the oxygen reduction reaction.,"Size-selected 9 nm PtxY nanoparticles have recently shown an outstanding catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, representing a promising cathode catalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Studying their electrochemical dealloying is a fundamental step towards the understanding of both their activity and stability. Herein, size-selected 9 nm PtxY nanoparticles have been deposited on the cathode side of a PEMFC specifically designed for in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS). The dealloying mechanism was followed in situ for the first time. It proceeds through the progressive oxidation of alloyed Y atoms, soon leading to the accumulation of Y(3+) cations at the cathode. Acid leaching with sulfuric acid is capable of accelerating the dealloying process and removing these Y(3+) cations which might cause long term degradation of the membrane. The use of APXPS under near operating conditions allowed observing the population of oxygenated surface species as a function of the electrochemical potential. Similar to the case of pure Pt nanoparticles, non-hydrated hydroxide plays a key role in the ORR catalytic process."

In this work we demonstrate solution-based effective barrier coatings based on composite of poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) and mica flakes for the protection of poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based organic solar cells (OSCs) against photobleaching under illumination conditions. In the first step we developed a protective layer with cost effective and environmentally friendly methods and optimized its properties in terms of transparency, barrier improvement factor, and bendability. The developed protective layer maintained a high transparency in the visible region and improved oxygen and moisture barrier quality by the factor of ~7. The resultant protective layers showed ultra-flexibility, as no significant degradation in protective characteristics were observed after 10 K bending cycles. In the second step, a PVB/mica composite layer was applied on top of the P3HT film and subjected to photo-degradation. The P3HT films coated with PVB/mica composite showed improved stability under constant light irradiation and exhibited a loss of <20% of the initial optical density over the period of 150 h. Finally, optimized barrier layers were used as encapsulation for organic solar cell (OSC) devices. The lifetime results confirmed that the stability of the OSCs was extended from few hours to over 240 h in a sun test (65 °C, ambient RH%) which corresponds to an enhanced lifetime by a factor of 9 compared to devices encapsulated with pristine PVB."

Plants offer a safe and cost‐effective production platform for biopharmaceuticals, vaccines and industrial enzymes boosting biomass conversion to biofuels. Production of intact and functional protein is a prerequisite for large‐scale protein production, and extensive host‐specific post‐translational modifications (PTMs) often affect the catalytic properties and stability of recombinant enzymes. Here we investigated the impact of plant PTMs on enzyme performance and stability of the major cellobiohydrolase TrCel7A from Trichoderma reesei, an industrially relevant enzyme. TrCel7A was produced in Nicotiana benthamiana using a vacuum‐based transient expression technology, and this recombinant enzyme (TrCel7Arec) was compared with the native fungal enzyme (TrCel7Anat) in terms of PTMs and catalytic activity on commercial and industrial substrates. We show that the N‐terminal glutamate of TrCel7Arec was correctly processed by N. benthamiana to a pyroglutamate, critical for protein structure, while the linker region of TrCel7Arec was vulnerable to proteolytic digestion during protein production due to the absence of O‐mannosylation in the plant host as compared with the native protein. In general, the purified full‐length TrCel7Arec had 25% lower catalytic activity than TrCel7Anat and impaired substrate‐binding properties, which can be attributed to larger N‐glycans and lack of O‐glycans in TrCel7Arec. All in all, our study reveals that the glycosylation machinery of N. benthamiana needs tailoring to optimize the production of efficient cellulases."

Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold have been widely used as linker layers for sensor surfaces. However, the degradation of the thiol-gold bond can limit the performance and durability of such surfaces, directly impacting their performance and cost-effectiveness. To this end, a new family of materials based on N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) has emerged as an alternative for surface modification, capable of self-assembling onto a gold surface with higher affinity and superior stability as compared to the thiol-based systems. Here we demonstrate three applications of NHC SAMs supporting a dextran layer as a tunable platform for developing various affinity-capture biosensor surfaces. We describe the development and testing of NHC-based dextran biosensor surfaces modified with each of streptavidin, nitrilotriacetic acid, and recombinant Protein A. These affinity-capture sensor surfaces enable oriented binding of ligands for optimal performance in biomolecular assays. Together, the intrinsic high stability and flexible design of the NHC biosensing platforms show great promise and open up exciting possibilities for future biosensing applications."
189,,2015.0,Facile route to freestanding CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 crystals using inverse solubility,"Since the first peer-reviewed publications of metalorgano halide perovskite based solar cells in 20091, research in materials of this family has undergone immense revival. They unite a broad range of suitable characteristics including long-range charge diffusion2, high extinction coefficient as well as ease of fabrication3. With solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies now exceeding 20%4, some already regard them as possible competitors to the well-established silicon technology5,6. Despite the undisputable impressive developments in conversion efficiencies for laboratory scale devices since the first reports, many non-trivial issues including long-term device stability and reproducibility, material degradation and toxicity of the water-soluble lead halide as well the establishment of reliable device testing protocols remain yet to be solved7. Much effort has been invested into the optimization of deposition conditions for thin films for application in solar cells with processes ranging from simple one-step solution deposition over sequential deposition processes8,9 to vapor based processes10,11. In most reported solution growth methods for freestanding crystals, supersaturation is achieved by cooling saturated solutions or by addition of poor solvents12,13. To the best of our knowledge, none of the reported protocols for the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 structures, including thin films as well as freestanding products, rely on inverse solubility. We report a facile method for rapid growth of large, freestanding crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 from a solution of γ -butyrolactone (GBL) through heating at unconventionally high temperatures. To our knowledge, the possibility of formation of crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 from solution in a good solvent without additives has not been reported. Several methods for the growth of freestanding crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 from solution have been reported14. Commonly, growing large freestanding crystals in solution is a slow process but Yang et al.15 have demonstrated a simple and efficient method for growth of CH3NH3PbI3 via sequential solution growth method. Their process allowed for the formation of crystals of a range of habits and sizes. Recently, Kollek et al. have reported a novel single-precursor route for the preparation of a range of nanostructures including porous, shape-anisotropic single crystals via crystal-to-crystal transformation16. Studies of important physical properties such as thermal conductivity, Hall Effect and others, commonly have to rely on freestanding structures rather than thin films17. Reported formations of"

The thermal stability of a number of organic liquids was evaluated at temperatures between 648 and 698 K and at H2 partial pressures of about 7 MPa. Certain saturated and partially-saturated, fused-ring compounds with no alkyl groups or bridges are quite stable at these conditions. Of the compounds tested, tetrahydronaphthalene, tetrahydroquinoline, and decahydronaphthalene were the most stable. Analysis of the liquids at the end of the thermal stability evaluation supports some speculation concerning possible degradation reactions."

Curcumin, one of the most important pharmacologically significant natural
products, has gained significant consideration among scientists for decades since its multipharmacological
activities. 1, 3-Dicarbonyl moiety of curcumin was found to be accountable for the
rapid degradation of curcumin molecule. The aim of present work is to replace 1, 3-dicarbonyl moiety
of curcumin by pyrazole and phenylpyrazole derivatives with a view to improving its stability and to
investigate the role of substitution in N-phenylpyrazole curcumin on its antibacterial activity against
both Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria.



Pyrazole derivatives of curcumin were prepared by heating curcumin with phenyhydrazine/
substituted phenyhydrazine derivatives in AcOH. The residue was purified by silica gel column
chromatography. Structures of purified compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR and Mass spectroscopy.
The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity by the microdilution broth
susceptibility test method against gram positive (S. aureus) and gram negative (E. coli).



Effects of substitution in N-phenylpyrazole curcumin derivatives against S. aureus and E. coli
were studied. The most active N-(3-Nitrophenylpyrazole) curcumin (12) exhibits twenty-fold more potency
against S. aureus (MIC: 10μg/mL)) and N-(2-Fluoroophenylpyrazole) curcumin (5) fivefold more
potency against E. coli (MIC; 50 μg/mL) than N-phenylpyrazole curcumin (4). Whereas, a remarkable
decline in anti-bacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli was observed when electron donating
groups were incorporated in N-phenylpyrazole curcumin (4). Comparative studies of synthesized compounds
suggest the effects of electron withdrawing and electron donating groups on unsubstituted phenylpyrazole
curcumin (4).



The structure-activity relationship (SAR) results indicated that the electron withdrawing
and electron donating at N-phenylpyrazole curcumin played key roles for their bacterial inhibitory effects.
The results of the antibacterial evaluation showed that the synthesized pyrazole derivatives of
curcumin displayed moderate to very high activity in S. aureus. In conclusion, the series of novel curcumin
derivatives were designed, synthesized and tested for their antibacterial activities against S. aureus
and E. coli. Among them, N-(3-Nitrophenylpyrazole curcumin; 12) was most active against S. aureus
(Gram-positive) and N-(2-Fluoroophenylpyrazole) curcumin (5) against E. coli (Gram-negative) bacteria.

193,10.1056/NEJMoa1508419,2016.0,Variant ASGR1 Associated with a Reduced Risk of Coronary Artery Disease.,"BACKGROUND
Several sequence variants are known to have effects on serum levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol that alter the risk of coronary artery disease.


METHODS
We sequenced the genomes of 2636 Icelanders and found variants that we then imputed into the genomes of approximately 398,000 Icelanders. We tested for association between these imputed variants and non-HDL cholesterol levels in 119,146 samples. We then performed replication testing in two populations of European descent. We assessed the effects of an implicated loss-of-function variant on the risk of coronary artery disease in 42,524 case patients and 249,414 controls from five European ancestry populations. An augmented set of genomes was screened for additional loss-of-function variants in a target gene. We evaluated the effect of an implicated variant on protein stability.


RESULTS
We found a rare noncoding 12-base-pair (bp) deletion (del12) in intron 4 of ASGR1, which encodes a subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, a lectin that plays a role in the homeostasis of circulating glycoproteins. The del12 mutation activates a cryptic splice site, leading to a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon that renders a truncated protein prone to degradation. Heterozygous carriers of the mutation (1 in 120 persons in our study population) had a lower level of non-HDL cholesterol than noncarriers, a difference of 15.3 mg per deciliter (0.40 mmol per liter) (P=1.0×10(-16)), and a lower risk of coronary artery disease (by 34%; 95% confidence interval, 21 to 45; P=4.0×10(-6)). In a larger set of sequenced samples from Icelanders, we found another loss-of-function ASGR1 variant (p.W158X, carried by 1 in 1850 persons) that was also associated with lower levels of non-HDL cholesterol (P=1.8×10(-3)).


CONCLUSIONS
ASGR1 haploinsufficiency was associated with reduced levels of non-HDL cholesterol and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)."
194,,2011.0,Activity and stability of feruloyl esterase A from Aspergillus niger in ionic liquid systems,"Feruloyl esterases (FAEs; EC 3.1.1.73) are accessory plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, which catalyse the hydrolysis of the ester bond between ferulic acid and the monosaccharide to which it is covalently linked. FAEs can however also be brought to catalyse the (trans)esterification reaction in solvents that favour synthesis over hydrolysis, i.e. systems with low water content such as organic solvents or ionic liquids (ILs). The esterification of sinapic acid with glycerol catalysed by FAE A from Aspergillus niger (AnFaeA) in a series of ILs containing 15% (v/v) buffer showed that AnFaeA stability – and hence activity – was highly dependent on the anion nature: AnFaeA was stable and active for more than 2 hours in [PF 6 ] - -based ILs, but rapidly lost activity in [BF 4 ] - -based systems. This effect can be explained in terms of hydrogen bonding capacity of the two anions: As predicted by the quantum chemistry-based COSMO-RS method, [BF 4 ] - has a tendency to form hydrogen bonds and thus interfere with the secondary structure of the enzyme, while [PF 6 ] - is unlikely to form hydrogen bonds and therefore does not cause denaturation of the enzyme. Similar results have been obtained for lipases [1], but this is the first report on FAE stability in ILs [2]. COSMO-RS, which is now widely used for solvent screening in the complex IL systems [3], may be a valuable tool for fast enzyme stability predictions and/or solvent screening in the future."

No analytical method is reported for estimation of impurities in Piribedil. The objective of this work was to develop a stability indicating method for estimation of impurities in Piribedil Tablets by using quality by design approach. Piribedil and its impurities are having different absorption maxima hence known impurities and unknown impurities were quantified at 210 nm and 238 nm respectively. Phosphate buffer (pH 4.3; 25 mM) and mixture of Phosphate buffer, Methanol, Acetonitrile (30:40:30, v/v respectively) were used in gradient elution mode. Zorbax SB Phenyl (150 x 4.6) mm, 3.5 µm column was used for separation. Mobile phase was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute and column was maintained at 45°. Injection volume was optimized as 10 µl. Critical chromatographic parameters such as Column oven temperature and pH of buffer were optimized by performing Design of experiments. Forced degradation studies were performed and all the degradants formed during forced degradation, were well separated from known impurities and from Piribedil peak. Mass balance was found more than > 98% in all the stressed conditions. The developed method was validated and found specific, precise, linear, accurate, rugged and robust."

This approach is based on the solidsolution hardening concept, according to which interaction of impurity atoms with dislocations makes the motion of the latter more difficult. Photoluminescence imaging spectroscopy is employed to investigate incorporation of Sb+ implants at the buried interface and also to assess its impact on structural degradation. Spectral results are analyzed considering both the onset of n-type doping and irradiation damage. The latter factor was estimated separately from supplementary measurements of high-energy (2.5 MeV H+) proton-irradiated 4H-SiC epilayers. We compare results of optically stimulated SF formation in virgin and Sb implanted regions and provide a comprehensive picture of the defect evolution, including microscopic details of the imminent nucleation sites."
197,10.1136/jcp.24.8.690,1971.0,Stability of prothrombin and factor VII in freeze-dried plasma,"The stability of prothrombin and factor VII was studied using accelerated degradation tests in three preparations of freeze-dried pooled normal plasmas. In a previous report (Brozović, Gurd, Robertson, and Bangham, 1971) factor X was shown to be relatively unstable in these preparations of freeze-dried plasma: it was calculated that up to 8% of the original factor X activity would be lost after 10 years at −20°C, up to 54% at 4°C, and up to 90% at room temperature. The losses of factor VII activity were estimated to be negligible at −20°C, between 2 and 18% at 4°C, and between 20 and 70% of the original activity at 20°C, after 10 years of storage. Prothrombin was found to be less stable than factor VII: the expected loss in 10 years at −20°C may be up to 4%, at 4°C up to 30%, and at 20°C up to 83% of the initial activity. These findings indicate that in freeze-dried plasma prothrombin as well as factor X may be insufficiently stable for plasma to serve as long-term reference material for the standardization of the one-stage prothrombin time. Moreover, the loss of prothrombin and factor X in freeze-dried plasma stored at 4°C may be so high that when it is required to preserve these factors it may be necessary to store freeze-dried plasma at lower temperatures."
198,10.1166/JBN.2009.1042,2009.0,Lipid nanomedicines for anticancer drug therapy.,"More than half of all people diagnosed with cancer receive chemotherapy. Unfortunately, most chemotherapy drugs cannot tell the difference between a cancer cell and a healthy cell. In this sense, some other drawbacks often encountered with antineoplastic compounds, such as poor stability and specificity and a high occurrence of drug-resistant tumor cells may be overcome to some degree by incorporating them into drug delivery systems. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) have arisen considerable interest in recent years. These are particles of submicron size made from a lipid matrix that is solid at room and body temperature. Moreover, the biodegradable and biocompatible nature of SLN makes them less toxic than other nanoparticulate systems. SLN are capable of encapsulating hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, and they also provide protection against chemical, photochemical or oxidative degradation of drugs, as well as the possibility of a sustained release of the incorporated drugs. Along with these last issues, the feasibility of scaling up for large scale production and the low cost of lipids as compared to biodegradable polymers or phospholipids have favoured their use as potential drug delivery systems. This review focuses on the recent advances in SLN as carriers for chemotherapeutic agent delivery."

The breakthrough was achieved in 1991 with the demonstration of a DNSC system reaching more than 7% efficiency and after a decade of intense research the commercialization is in reach. Besides efficiency, stability is equally important for the step from research to the market. Therefore, the stability of such devices has been under close investigation since the DNSC was presented. In this contribution we summarize the literature about device testing and the attempts to understand the degradation mechanisms. Solar cells developed for energy production are discussed as well as alternative systems for low power applications, e.g., DNSCs on plastic substrates. The components (substrate, nano-structured TiO2, dye, electrolyte, additive and counter electrode) are analyzed towards their stability and how it affects the durability of the entire system. From this analysis, guidelines for testing and improving the stability of the DNSC are deduced."
200,,2021.0,Solution Coated PVB/Mica Flake Coatings for the Encapsulation of Organic Solar Cells,": Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) die due to their interactions with environmental gases, i.e., moisture and oxygen, the latter being the most dangerous, especially under illumination, due to the fact that most of the active layers used in OPVs are extremely sensitive to oxygen. In this work we demonstrate solution-based effective barrier coatings based on composite of poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) and mica ﬂakes for the protection of poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based organic solar cells (OSCs) against photobleaching under illumination conditions. In the ﬁrst step we developed a protective layer with cost effective and environmentally friendly methods and optimized its properties in terms of transparency, barrier improvement factor, and bendability. The developed protective layer maintained a high transparency in the visible region and improved oxygen and moisture barrier quality by the factor of ~7. The resultant protective layers showed ultra-ﬂexibility, as no signiﬁcant degradation in protective characteristics were observed after 10 K bending cycles. In the second step, a PVB/mica composite layer was applied on top of the P3HT ﬁlm and subjected to photo-degradation. The P3HT ﬁlms coated with PVB/mica composite showed improved stability under constant light irradiation and exhibited a loss of <20% of the initial optical density over the period of 150 h. Finally, optimized barrier layers were used as encapsulation for organic solar cell (OSC) devices. The lifetime results conﬁrmed that the stability of the OSCs was extended from few hours to over 240 h in a sun test (65 ◦ C, ambient RH%) which corresponds to an enhanced lifetime by a factor of 9 compared to devices encapsulated with pristine PVB."
201,10.1029/2020EF001495,2020.0,Tackling the Trickle: Ensuring Sustainable Water Management in the Arab Region,"Water scarcity in the Arab region is intensifying due to population growth, economic development, and the impacts of climate change. It is manifested in groundwater depletion, freshwater ecosystem degradation, deteriorating water quality, low levels of water storage per capita, and added pressures on transboundary water resources. High‐income Arab countries have sought to circumvent the ever‐present challenges of water scarcity through agricultural imports (virtual water trade), desalination, and, increasingly, wastewater reuse. In this review article, we argue that the narrative of water scarcity and supply‐side technological fixes masks more systemic issues that threaten sustainable water management, including underperforming water utilities, protracted armed conflict and displacement, agricultural policies aimed at self‐sufficiency, evolving food consumption behaviors, the future of energy markets, and educational policy. Water management challenges, particularly on the demand side, and responses in the Arab region cannot be understood in isolation from these broader regional and international political and socioeconomic trends. Recognizing the complex and interdependent challenges of water management is the first step in reforming approaches and shifting to more sustainable development outcomes and stability in the Arab region and beyond."

Over three million deaths are similarly prevented from measles, neonatal tetanus and pertussis (51). These achievements are partly attributable to the training of staff in the proper storage and transport of vaccines and partly to improvements in the cold chain. However, vaccines are still not being stored and transported properly in many areas. Questions are often raised as to what should be done with stocks of vaccines that have been exposed for varying periods to elevated temperatures. There is no simple and cheap method that can be used in the field to assess whether a vaccine exposed to ambient temperature has retained at least the minimum required potency, although the vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) now provided with oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) can indicate the level of heat exposure of individual vials. Vaccine potency can be determined only by costly laboratory assays, the results of which are often delayed for several months. Only a large number of doses can justify sending a vaccine for retesting (from 2000 doses for poliomyelitis and measles vaccines, to 200 000 doses for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine) (45). A knowledge of a vaccine's stability, especially of the rate of decline in potency at a given temperature, can be helpful in determining storage requirements. The present document …"

 Generation of Fullerene from a Poly(fullerene)","This article appraises the thermal, photo‐ and photo‐oxidative stability of poly(fullerene)‐alt‐[bismethylbenzene)]s (PFBMBs) prepared by the atom transfer radical addition polymerization (ATRAP) with particular attention paid to their use as additives in organic photovoltaic devices. PFBMBs are of interest due to their well‐defined structures based on alternating, main‐chain, fullerene‐methylene links. This work shows by way of a wide range of characterization techniques and a small library of PFBMBs with varying side chains, however, that PFBMBs are relatively unstable. Given that prior work has shown that other main‐chain fullerene polymers, such as poly(pyrrolidinofullerene)s, are inherently stable, we suggest a degradation mechanism specific to the fullerene‐methylene links of PFBMBs, which explains their unusual behavior. This work suggests that polymers based on fullerene each have their own specific stabilities and qualities and that PFBMBs might be of more use in purposes other than OPVs where in situ delivery of fullerene is required, for example, in medical applications. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

204,10.1039/C4TA02137A,2014.0,7.9% efficient vapor-deposited organic photovoltaic cells based on a simple bulk heterojunction,"Efficient organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on vapor-deposited small molecule materials frequently utilize a planar-mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) architecture, in which a mixed layer of electron donating and accepting materials is sandwiched between neat, planar layers of the donor and acceptor. The neat layers contribute to photocurrent, help minimize the dark current and maximize the device open-circuit voltage. The use of organic semiconductors as the planar layers is not however without complication, as the low charge carrier mobility in these materials can hinder efficient charge collection. In this work, we examine OPVs where the neat donor layer between the anode and the mixture is replaced with a layer of MoOx. An average device power conversion efficiency of (7.7 ± 0.3)% is realized under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) solar simulated illumination in a uniformly mixed heterojunction OPV based on the donor–acceptor pairing of 2-{[7-(4-N,N-ditolylaminophenylen-1-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4-yl]methylene}malononitrile (DTDCPB)–C70 without any adjacent donor or acceptor layers. Correcting for spectral mismatch, an average device power conversion efficiency of (7.9 ± 0.3)% is obtained, with a champion device efficiency of 8.2%. The use of MoOxversus a neat donor layer is found to reduce the series resistance and facilitate charge collection from the mixed layer, leading to an increased fill factor and short-circuit current. To our knowledge, this result is among the highest single-cell efficiencies reported for vapor-deposited small molecule OPVs. We further find that mixed OPVs based on DTDCPB–C70 exhibit a promising shelf lifetime, showing no degradation in efficiency after more than seven months. Thus, the removal of the neat planar organic layer can favorably affect device efficiency without potentially adversely impacting stability."

Because CAR participates physiologically in the formation of tight-junction protein complexes, we examined whether molecular mechanisms known to down-regulate cell-cell adhesions cause loss of CAR expression. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)–mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a phenomenon associated with tumor progression that is characterized by loss of epithelial-type cell-cell adhesion molecules (including E-cadherin and the tight junction protein ZO-1), gain of mesenchymal biochemical markers, such as fibronectin, and acquisition of a spindle cell phenotype. CAR expression is reduced in tumor cells that have undergone EMT in response to TGF-β. This down-regulation results from repression of CAR gene transcription, whereas altered RNA stability and increased proteasomal protein degradation play no role. Loss of CAR expression in response to TGF-β is accompanied by reduced susceptibility to adenovirus infection. Indeed, treatment of carcinoma cells with LY2109761, a specific pharmacologic inhibitor of TGF-β receptor types I and II kinases, resulted in increased CAR RNA and protein levels as well as improved infectability with adenovirus. This was observed in cells induced to undergo EMT by addition of exogenous TGF-β and in those that were transformed by endogenous autocrine/paracrine TGF-β. These findings show down-regulation of CAR in the context of EMT and suggest that combination of therapeutic adenoviruses and TGF-β receptor inhibitors could be an efficient anticancer strategy.

206,10.1002/cbic.200900342,2009.0,The Conserved Glu in the Cyclotide Cycloviolacin O2 Has a Key Structural Role,"Cyclotides are a large family of plant peptides that are characterised by a head‐to‐tail circular backbone and three disulfide bonds that are arranged in a cystine knot. This unique structural feature, which is referred to as a cyclic cystine knot, gives the cyclotides remarkable stability against chemical and biological degradation. In addition to their natural function as insecticides for plant defence, the cyclotides have a range of bioactivities with pharmaceutical relevance, including cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. A glutamic acid residue, aside from the invariable disulfide array, is the most conserved feature throughout the cyclotide family, and it has recently been shown to be crucial for biological activity. Here we have used solution‐state NMR spectroscopy to determine the three‐dimensional structures of the potent cytotoxic cyclotide cycloviolacin O2, and an inactive analogue in which this conserved glutamic acid has been methylated. The structures of the peptides show that the glutamic acid has a key structural role in coordinating a set of hydrogen bonds in native cycloviolacin O2; this interaction is disrupted in the methylated analogue. The proposed mechanism of action of cyclotides is membrane disruption and these results suggest that the glutamic acid is linked to cyclotide function by stabilising the structure to allow efficient aggregation in membranes, rather than in a direct interaction with a target receptor."

However, further improvement of operational stability remains a challenge. In this contribution, focus is placed on corrosion and delamination of the metal contact, which are mainly caused by oxygen or water vapor ingress but in other cases also via mechanical wear and different thermal expansion coefficients. So‐called pinholes and electrode edges provide pathways for ingress of water vapor and oxygen, which may attack the metal–organic interface. Thus, electrical insolation via formation of insulating metal oxide and concomitant mechanical delamination occurs. As charge injection and extraction is suppressed at insulated and delaminated areas, the active area contributing to power conversion gets reduced. This work links analytical and numerical predictions about the active area in contact with the electrode to experimentally observe dependencies. Spatially and time‐resolved electroluminescence measurements provide information on location, size, and growth‐rate of insulated areas. Area loss rates for dark spots depend either sub‐linear (for early stages and edge‐ingress) or linear (later stages) on time. The initial defect size has a clear impact on growth rates.

The use of naphthalene-based processing additives has been undertaken, which is shown to reduce the initial power conversion efficiency by 23%–42%, primarily due to a decrease in the short-circuit current density, but also fill factor. However, the stability is greatly enhanced by using such additives, with the long term stability (T50%) enhanced by a factor of four. The results show that there is a trade-off between initial performance and stability to consider when selecting the initial process additives. XPS studies have provided some insight into the decreased degradation and show that using 1-chloronaphthalene (ClN) leads to reduced morphology changes and reduced oxidation of the thiophene-ring within the PCPDTBT backbone."

While substantial attention has been focused on optimization of active layer chemistry, morphology, and processing, far less research has been directed to understanding charge transport at the interfaces between the electrodes and the active layer. Electrical properties of these interfaces not only impact efficiency, but also play a central role in stability of organic solar cells. Low work function metals are the most widely used materials for the electron transport layer with Ca being the most common material. In bulk heterojunction OPV devices, low work function metals are believed to mirror the role they play in OLEDs, where such metals are used to control carrier selectivity, transport, extraction, and blocking, as well as interface band bending. Despite their advantages, low work function materials are generally prone to reactions with water, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide from air leading to rapid device degradation. Here we discuss the search for a new metallic cathode interlayer material that increases device stability and still provides device efficiency similar to that achieved with a Ca interlayer."

PEGs of four different molecular weights (2k, 6k, 10k, and 20k) were functionalized with G1-allyl dendrons using anhydride chemistry to produce tetra-functional TEC crosslinkable PEGs. The tetra-functional PEGs were subsequently crosslinked with a tri-functional thiol in ethanol to form hydrogels. The synthesized hydrogels were characterized with respect to swelling behaviour, rheological properties and hydrolytic degradation. It was found that the molecular weight of the PEG chain greatly influences the final properties of the hydrogel, where a higher molecular weight of PEG gives an increased weight swelling ratio from 240% for PEG-2k hydrogels to 1400% for PEG-20k hydrogels, as well as decreased elastic moduli, with Young's moduli ranging from 106 MPa to 6 MPa, for PEG-2k and PEG-20k hydrogels, respectively. It was also found that the hydrolytic stability in alkaline conditions (pH 10) decreased when the molecular weight of PEG in the hydrogels increased."

Pyrolyses were carried out in anhydrous closed system (gold vessels) during times ranging from 1 to 360 h under isothermal conditions (325−425 °C) and various pressures (120, 400, and 800 bar) in the range of those occurring in petroleum systems. Results show that degradation of n-C25 follows a first-order kinetics under isothermal conditions at 120 bar. The main chemical class produced along increasing severity is the saturated hydrocarbons ranging from C10 to C22 (80 wt %). The gas contribution is very low (<2 wt %) up to 85 wt % conversion. On the basis of the linearity of the Arrhenius plot, accurate kinetic parameters were calculated (E = 68.2 kcal/mol and A = 6.1 × 1017 s-1). An extrapolation of these kinetic parameters to geological conditions shows that n-C25..."

its Nutraceutical Properties","Anthocyanin pigments are readily degraded during processing and storage of foodstuffs that can have a
dramatic impact on color quality and may also affect the nutritional properties. Total anthocyanin pigment
content and indices for polymeric color and browning are easily measured with simple spectrophotometric
methods. Once individual pigments are identified, their changes can be monitored by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). The edible fruits of 12 plants were extracted in methanol and subjected to
solvent–solvent partitioning to yield three fractions, hexane, ethyl acetate, and aqueous. A number of factors
affecting anthocyanin stability and color are discussed in this review. Anthocyanins are probably the most
spectacular of plant pigments since they are responsible for most of the red, purple and blue pigmentation of
flowers, hits and vegetables. However, because of their highly reactive nature, anthocyanins readily
degrade, or react with other constituents in the media, to form colorless or brown colored compounds. The
presence of an oxonium ion adjacent to carbon 2 makes the anthocyanins particularly susceptible to
nucleophilic attack by such compounds as sulfur dioxide, ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide and even water.
Loss of anthocyanin pigmentation also occurs in the presence of oxygen and various enzymes, and as a
result of high temperature processing. Certain degree of pigment stabilization may be conferred by acylation
with various organic acids, co pigmentation, self-association and/or metal chelation. In addition, pH has a
marked effect on anthocyanin stability, and on the color of media containing these pigments. A number of
anthocyanin-rich sources have been investigated for their potential as commercial pigment extracts. Although
their application is primarily limited to acidic media, continued research on the chemistry of anthocyanins
may lead to application and stabilization of these pigments in a wider variety of food products."

Only homopolymeric adenosine tails located at the 3′ end were efficiently removed by the exonuclease. The poly(A) removing activity did not require any specific sequences in the mRNA body either for poly(A) removal or for accumulation of the deadenylated mRNA. We conclude that the poly(A) removing activity is a 3′ exonuclease since (i) reaction intermediates gradually lose the poly(A) tail, (ii) degradation is prevented by the presence of a cordycepin residue at the 3′ end and (iii) RNAs having internally located poly(A) stretches are poor substrates for degradation. The possible involvement of the poly(A) removing enzyme in regulating mRNA translation and stability is discussed."

The commonly used organic semiconductor PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) is hygroscopic in nature and can therefore be easily damaged if exposed to air and/or light illumination. In this study, we doped PEDOT:PSS with WOx nanocrystallites and found that organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with the WOx doped PEDOT:PSS degrade only by 5%, while OPVs with undoped PEDOT:PSS retain only 23% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after storing for 5000 h in air. Also, doping PEDOT:PSS with WOx enhances the initial PCE by ∼13%, owing to reduced leakage current density and better Ohmic contact between the PEDOT:PSS and the anode."

The majority of compounds demonstrated an elevation of in vitro potency relative to that of the parent nucleoside, and unlike d4T, all retained full activity in thymidine kinase-deficient cells. The compound bearing a p-chloro aryl group (8e) expressed nanomolar activity in vitro, a 14-fold increase in activity relative to that of the unsubstituted phosphoramidate (100-fold compared to d4T). An assay using pig liver esterase was used to establish the stability of the compounds to enzymatic degradation. While there was no apparent correlation between in vitro activity and half-life of enzymatic degradation, there was a close correlation between compound lipophilicity, determined by octanol/water partition coefficient, and in vitro potency. We suggest that substitutions made to the aryl moiety of the aryl phosphoramidate of d4T that result in enhancing lipophilicity may serve to increase the cellular uptake of the prodrug by passive diffusion, leading to the expression of antiviral potency at reduced prodrug concentrations."

219,,2006.0,Transforming growth factor-beta receptor inhibition enhances adenoviral infectability of carcinoma cells via up-regulation of Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor in conjunction with reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"Expression of the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) is frequently reduced in carcinomas, resulting in decreased susceptibility of such tumors to infection with therapeutic adenoviruses. Because CAR participates physiologically in the formation of tight-junction protein complexes, we examined whether molecular mechanisms known to down-regulate cell-cell adhesions cause loss of CAR expression. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a phenomenon associated with tumor progression that is characterized by loss of epithelial-type cell-cell adhesion molecules (including E-cadherin and the tight junction protein ZO-1), gain of mesenchymal biochemical markers, such as fibronectin, and acquisition of a spindle cell phenotype. CAR expression is reduced in tumor cells that have undergone EMT in response to TGF-beta. This down-regulation results from repression of CAR gene transcription, whereas altered RNA stability and increased proteasomal protein degradation play no role. Loss of CAR expression in response to TGF-beta is accompanied by reduced susceptibility to adenovirus infection. Indeed, treatment of carcinoma cells with LY2109761, a specific pharmacologic inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor types I and II kinases, resulted in increased CAR RNA and protein levels as well as improved infectability with adenovirus. This was observed in cells induced to undergo EMT by addition of exogenous TGF-beta and in those that were transformed by endogenous autocrine/paracrine TGF-beta. These findings show down-regulation of CAR in the context of EMT and suggest that combination of therapeutic adenoviruses and TGF-beta receptor inhibitors could be an efficient anticancer strategy."
220,,2015.0,Synthesis and characterisation in organic electronics,"Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted great interest in recent years due to their potential for offering low-cost solar energy conversion. However, problems, such as low efficiency and short lifetimes limit their application. Mechanical and electrical instability of OPVs is a result of complex degradation processes such as delamination. As this process occurs at the weakest interface in OPV devices, located between poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(p-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and the photoactive layer, the adhesion could be improved by introduction of an interlayer between the aforementioned layers. To this end, new amphiphilic interfacial copolymers were designed. The aim was to obtain a block copolymer consisting of a hydrophilic block being in contact with the PEDOT:PSS layer and a hydrophobic block interacting with the photoactive layer. Since, roll-to-roll OPV production requires deposition of materials from solution, a post-deposition method of thermal transformation of the hydrophobic copolymer into amphiphilic material was developed. Firstly, a protocol for the synthesis of thermally modifiable R-alkyl p-styrene sulfonates was optimised using Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. Subsequently, thermal behaviour of the products comprising various alkyl protecting groups was investigated. As a result, the isobutyl group was identified as the most thermally labile, but storage-stable, protecting group, and therefore, was used for synthesis of the thermally modifiable poly(isobutyl p-styrene sulfonate) (PiBSS) block. In the next step, the best conditions for preparation of the poly(dodecyl p-styrene sulfonate) (PDDSS) hydrophobic block were optimised. Finally, a library of new interfacial PiBSS-b-PDDSS copolymers with varied lengths of both blocks was synthesised. Thermal behaviour of the copolymers was tested in the bulk and in films, with the thin film morphologies studied further by Grazing Incidence Small- and Wide-angle X-ray Scattering. Preliminary electrical studies on devices with the incorporated interlayer were performed showing the potential for further use of these copolymers in OPV. In the industrial component of this thesis (Chapter 4), a series of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(p- styrene sulfonate) (PEO-PSS) block copolymers was synthesised for application as counter ion templates in EDOT polymerisation. Significant differences in PEDOT dispersion quality were observed whist using PEO-b-PSS, PSS-b-PEO-b-PSS and PEO-PSS multiblock copolymers, showing that the latter gave the most stable dispersions. Overall, this work presents the preparation of new copolymers particularly attractive to roll- to-roll industrial printing of organic electronics for their long-term stability"
221,,2008.0,"Increased systemic stability, tumor accumulation and in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a secretory phospholipase 2-degradable liposomal form of cisplatin.","AACR Annual Meeting-- Apr 12-16, 2008; San Diego, CA

5618 

Cisplatin is one of the most potent antitumor agents known, displaying activity against a large number of solid tumors. However, side-effects such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity as well as cellular resistance to the agent mean that this is not a first choice drug in many cancers. An improved drug delivery system which is expected to reduce these side effects is highly desirable. We have designed a liposomal form of cisplatin (LiplaCis) that can be specifically degraded by secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). sPLA2 is often present in tumor tissues, either expressed by the cancerous cells or by infiltrating immune cells thereby assuring a site-specific release in the tumor micro-environment. The specificity of sPLA2-mediated release was demonstrated in vitro with cells highly resistant to LiplaCis in the absence of sPLA2. In contrast, in the presence of sPLA2 the IC50 values are lower than for free cisplatin which is due to a simultaneous release of lysolipids from the liposomes. In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments in rats and mice show an increased stability in plasma and the effect is present after >14 days. Xenograft studies in nude mice using the mouse mammary carcinoma tumor model MT-3, the mouse colon carcinoma CT-26 or the human colon carcinoma Colo205 revealed long-lasting tumor accumulation of LiplaCis within hours after administration. Efficacy studies using the MT-3 -model showed improved tumor elimination compared to the free drug with similar toxicity. Thus, LiplaCis is expected to perform better than free cisplatin in the clinic and phase one studies will be initiated in early 2008."

 has been established and validated for the simultaneous quantification of lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil 
 fumarate, doravirine and efavirenz in bulk and pharmaceutical formulations. The chromatographic 
 separation was performed on Acquity Ethylene Bridged Hybrid Phenyl (50 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) 
 column. The isocratic elution system of water and acetonitrile in the ratio 50:50 v/v pumped at a flow rate 
 0.4 ml/min in isocratic mode. The injection volume set was 1 μl and the detection wavelength was 238 nm. 
 The column temperature was set at 30o. The retention times of lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 
 doravirine and efavirenz were found to be 1.012 min, 1.233 min, 1.428 min and 1.666 min respectively 
 with a total run time of 3 min. The proposed method was validated according to International Council 
 on Harmonisation Q2 (R1) guidelines. The percentage recoveries were found to be in the range of 99.56 
 -100.40 %. The relative standard deviation values obtained during precision studies were found to be 
 less than 2. Linearity between concentration and response was found within the specified concentration 
 range and the correlation coefficient was found to be 0.999 for all the drugs. Degradation studies were 
 carried out under various stress conditions such as acid, base, oxidation, heat and light and found no 
 interference of degraded impurity peaks at the retention time of analyte peaks. Hence, the proposed 
 ultra-performance liquid chromatographic method can be utilized in the routine quality investigation of 
 lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, doravirine and efavirenz either individually or simultaneously 
 in bulk and co-formulated dosage forms."

Post-treatment of the films in supercritical carbon dioxide, in the presence of small amounts of either tetraisopropoxide, tetramethoxysilane, or other precursors, greatly improved the thermal stability of the mesoporous coatings without affecting their optical transparency or integrity. Nanosized anatase crystallites formed within the mesostructured walls, during the supercritical fluid treatment and calcination, prevented unidirectional contraction of the films and collapse of the pore walls at the high temperatures employed. In addition, the post-treated mesoporous titania films exhibited high photocatalytic efficiency in the degradation of waste organic compounds."

Integrating plasmonics with OPVs has improved their efficiency; however, the stability effects are unknown. We demonstrate that plasmonic effects can improve the lifetime and efficiency. The aging effects on charge carrier generation and transport are investigated. Confocal time-resolved photoluminescence of Au nanoparticle (NP) doped polymer blend was performed to understand the plasmonic effects on excited-state dynamics. Hot exciton generation is observed directly at the Au-NP surface, which contributed to achieving a nearly perfect exciton dissociation yield. We found that slow aging of the plasmonic effect and the hot exciton contribution are the reasons for the improved lifetimes of plasmon-enhanced OPVs. This work opens up a new direction for improving the stability of OPVs and enhancing the application of plasmonics."

To establish specificity and to develop a stability indicating method, Danazol was subjected to the stress conditions like oxidative, acid, base, hydrolytic, thermal and photolytic degradation. Chromatographic separation was achieved on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) by quality by design (QbD) approach. The eluted compounds were monitored at 270 nm. All the degradation products were well resolved from the main peak, proving the stability-indicating power of the method.

227,,2016.0,Solution processed hole extraction interfaces for polymer solar cells,"Organic semiconductors often make poor ohmic contacts with electrodes due to the 
deep energy levels forming an energetic barrier at the interfaces between the organic 
layer and the electrode contact. The mismatch in energy levels at the interface was 
overcome by inserting PEDOT:PSS material as an anode interlayer for achieving good 
ohmic contact and selecting single types of charge carriers at the polymer-electrode 
interface. Despite the significant development that was observed in the OPVs 
performance, the residual moisture and the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS can cause 
degradation of the organic films and therefore affect long term stability. Metal oxides 
were later suggested as alternative interlayers to the PEDOT:PSS which exhibited high 
performance and long lifetimes. However, many of the metal oxide studies reported in 
literature used vacuum deposition methods, such as thermal evaporation and sputter 
deposition, which are not necessarily desirable for large-scale production. 
This thesis shows that it is possible to deposit Vanadium oxide (V2Ox) from solution in 
ambient conditions requiring no post-deposition treatment and achieving comparable 
efficiency to the most widely used interlayer materials. Using a combination of 
spectroscopic techniques and device characterisation, it is shown that solutionprocessed 
V2Ox can be used to replace evaporated metal oxides in optoelectronic 
devices which are fabricated at high temperatures. The work also goes on to show that it 
is possible to solution-process nickel oxide from a nickel acetylacetonate precursor and 
obtain a power conversion efficiency > 5%. Finally, the lifetime study of OPV devices 
utilising various anode interlayer materials shows that the stability of optimised V2Ox 
devices can be comparable with other interlayer materials."
228,,2016.0,Micromechanical Modeling of Oxidation Induced Stresses in SiC/SiC Composites,"Silicon Carbide fiber reinforced composites are used in high temperature aerospace and propulsion applications due to their light weight, increased toughness and high thermal stability. However, their durability is limited due to environmental degradation. This paper focuses on the oxidation of SiC fibers and SiC/SiC composites at high temperature. The constrained volume expansion accompanying oxidation leads to development of large residual volumetric growth stresses. A micromechanical model was used to study the effect of oxidation induced stresses in a SiC fiber and in a unitcell of a SiC/SiC lamina. The oxidation induced strains are estimated by using Pilling- Bedworth expansion ratio and applied to the oxide layer as volumetric strains. The evolution of the oxide layer and stresses during isothermal aging was simulated using finite element methods. Two studies have been conducted considering with intact PyC and eroded PyC interphase regions. Paper describes the stresses developing during oxide growth with linear elastic and visco-elastic oxide layer behaviors. Simulations results are compared with experimental data and predictions from other models obtained from published literature."
229,,2011.0,Fast switching 1200 V 50 A silicon carbide BJT's in boost converters,"Silicon carbide (SiC) bipolar junction transistors (BJT's) are normally-off fast switching devices with very low collector-emitter voltages (VCE), combining the best of properties from unipolar and bipolar technology. They switch fast with turn-offs from semi saturated state without current tails and have the same time extremely low saturated UCE values. SiC BJT's free from bipolar degradation were fabricated and packaged in TO-247 packages. The BJT's fabricated were characterized both statically and dynamically in a setup similar to a switching application, as well as tested for stability. A SPICE model was developed and simulations of the switching transitions were done and compared to measurements. The good properties of SiC BJT's make a large impact on system design. Higher efficiencies can be achieved at higher switching frequencies, which reduce size of inductances and heat sinks, as has been shown by simulations."

Evidence is presented here for rapid decay of common organic films such as N,N′‐bis(naphthalen‐1‐ yl)‐N,N′‐bis(phenyl)‐benzidine (NPB), tris(8‐hydroxy‐quinolinato)aluminum (Alq3), and rubrene when they are in contact with an UV‐ITO substrate. While the photoluminescence (PL) of these organic films deposited on an UV‐ITO substrate decay rapidly under illumination; those on quartz substrates are comparatively much more stable. Results from X‐ray and UV photoemission spectroscopies (XPS and UPS) further suggest that degradations of the rubrene films on UV‐ITO substrate are mainly attributed to active oxygen species generated upon UV‐ozone treatment. These reactive oxygen species on the UV‐ITO surface behave as a reservoir of oxygen that interacts with rubrene and shifts its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level away from the Fermi level. This interaction induces a gap‐state in the energy gap of rubrene, which acts as a charge recombination center. More importantly, enhanced stabilities of rubrene‐based organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are demonstrated when they are fabricated on gold‐coated or trifluoromethane (CHF3) plasma‐treated ITO. The presented works shows that the commonly used UV‐ITO substrate is a threat to the stability of addlayer organic semiconducting films."

Mutant vectors were constructed and CV-1 cells were transfected with constructs, where Cys402 was substituted for a serine, and metabolically labelled with [3H]-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcN). Radioimmunoprecipitation with an hyperimmunserum, specific for gp 120/gp 160, and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated presence of gp 160, whereas gp 120 was replaced by [3H]-GlcN-labelled material, migrating as a diffuse band corresponding to 80-105 k, suggesting increased sensitivity of mutant e n v gene products to proteolysis after cleavage to gpl20. Wild type gpl20 and gpl60 bound to CD4, whereas neither gpl60 nor gpl20 from mutant-transfected cell lysates did bind to CD4. Altogether the results indicated that Cys402, probably by participating in a disulfide bridge, is essential for (i) the CD4-binding ability of e n v gene products and for (ii) the physical stability of gp 120."

After its uptake into macrophage lysosomes by receptor-mediated endocytosis, oxLDL is poorly degraded, resulting in ceroid-containing foam cells. We studied the influence ofoxLDL on lysosomal enzyme activity and, in particular, on lysosomal membrane stability and the modulation of these cellular characteristics by HDL and vitamin E (vit-E). Unexposed cells and cells exposed to acetylated LDL (AcLDL) were used as controls. The lysosomal marker enzymes cathepsin L and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAbetaGase) were biochemically assayed in J-774 cells after fractionation. Lysosomal integrity in living cells was assayed by the acridine orange (AO) relocation test. Cathepsin D was immunocytochemically demonstrated in J-774 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that the total activities of NAbetaGase and cathepsin L were significantly decreased, whereas their relative cytosolic activities were enhanced, after oxLDL exposure. Labilization of the lysosomal membranes was further proven by decreased lysosomal AO uptake and relocation to the cytosol of cathepsin D, as estimated by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. HDL and vit-E diminished the cytotoxicity of oxLDL by decreasing the lysosomal damage. The results indicate that endocytosed oxLDL not only partially inactivates lysosomal enzymes but also destabilizes the acidic vacuolar compartment, causing relocation of lysosomal enzymes to the cytosol. Exposure to AcLDL resulted in its uptake with enlargement of the lysosomal apparatus, but the stability of the lysosomal membranes was not changed."

Magnetic susceptibility (MS) has been proposed as an inexpensive, long-term monitoring proxy of the degradation of HC. We acquired repeated down hole MS logging data in boreholes at a HC-contaminated field research site in Bemidji, MN, USA. The MS data were analyzed in conjunction with redox conditions and iron availability within the source zone to better assess whether MS can serve as a proxy for monitoring HC contamination in unconsolidated sediments. The MS response at the site diminished during the sampling period, which was found to coincide with depletion of solid phase iron in the source zone. Previous geochemical observations and modeling at the site suggest that the most likely cause of the decrease in MS is the transformation of magnetite to siderite, coupled with the exhaustion of ferrihydrite. Although the temporal MS response at this site gives valuable field-scale evidence for changing conditions of iron cycling and stability of iron minerals it does not provide a simple proxy for long-term monitoring of biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the smear zone."
234,,2013.0,QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF SIALIC ACID IN INDIAN MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS,"Background: Sialic acids are acidic sugars with a 9-carbon backbone, expressed as terminal residue on mammalian glycoconjugates. Sialic acid was found in two forms as N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) in meat and milk products. Neu5Ac is important for the brain and neuro development while Neu5Gc is suspected as human carcinogen. There is no data reported on sialic acid content in Indian milk and milk based products. Objective: To determine sialic acid (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc) content in Indian milk and milk products and thermal stability of non-human sialic acid (Neu5Gc) evaluation. Design: Milk products like chocolate, infant food products, milk based energy drinks, butter etc were examined for the sialic acid content. For Neu5Gc thermal stability studies cow, buffalo, cross cows and processed milk were used. Conclusion: The study indicates the level of sialic acid (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc) in Indian milk and milk based products. Further the stability studies shows degradation (20 to 22 %) of non-human sialic acid (Neu5Gc) to the total sialic acid content."
235,10.1021/MA991773E,2000.0,Synthesis and Properties of Hydroxy-Terminated Poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s,"This paper describes the biosynthesis and properties of bacterial poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s (PHA) with predominantly hydroxyl end groups. Hydroxy termination is achieved by the addition of low molecular weight diols to the culture. It is found that low molecular weight diols of various structures can be easily incorporated as chain ends, when used during fermentation, by a variety of microorganisms. Incorporation of a chiral diol does not appear to be stereospecific; both (R)- and (S)-1,2-propanediols were incorporated into the polymer. Moreover, both primary and secondary hydroxyl groups of 1,2-propanediol were found to have reacted. It was found that an increase in the hydroxy termination in P(3HB) leads to an increase in the thermal stability, most likely by prolonging the condensation reaction and delaying the degradation reaction."
236,10.1046/J.1432-1033.2003.03606.X,2003.0,Tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme is processed by proprotein-convertases to its mature form which is degraded upon phorbol ester stimulation.,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM17) is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of type I membrane proteins and mediates the ectodomain shedding of various membrane-anchored signaling and adhesion proteins. TACE is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, which is subsequently proteolytically processed to the catalytically active form. We have identified the proprotein-convertases PC7 and furin to be involved in maturation of TACE. This maturation is negatively influenced by the phorbol ester phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), which decreases the cellular amount of the mature form of TACE in PMA-treated HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, we found that stimulation of protein kinase C or protein kinase A signaling pathways did not influence long-term degradation of mature TACE. Interestingly, PMA treatment of furin-deficient LoVo cells did not affect the degradation of mature TACE. By examination of furin reconstituted LoVo cells we were able to exclude the possibility that PMA modulates furin activity. Moreover, the PMA dependent decrease of the mature enzyme form is specific for TACE, as the amount of mature ADAM10 was unaffected in PMA-treated HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. Our results indicate that the activation of TACE by the proprotein-convertases PC7 and furin is very similar to the maturation of ADAM10 although there is a significant difference in the cellular stability of the mature enzyme forms after phorbol ester treatment."
237,,2015.0,Characterisation and lifetime studies of CPDT- and BT- based photovoltaic cells,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices provide an opportunity for low cost, printable solar cells. This thesis focuses upon improving power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and lifetimes of OPV devices, with an emphasis on studying materials made from cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) monomers. The first part of the work focuses on characterising the optical and electrical properties of new materials based on this material system. A donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) small molecule, with the monomer order of CPDTBT-CPDT (C2B1) was trialled and demonstrated an optical band gap of 1.8 eV. OFET mobility was measured as 5 x 10 cm.V.s in the saturation region, and when blended with phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), gave a PCE of 1.54% under AM1.5G illumination. The moderate performance directed research towards donor-acceptor (D-A) polymers (PCPDTBT), synthesised using direct heterolytic arylation. OPV devices made with this material blended with PC71BM gave a maximum PCE of 4.23%, when tested under AM1.5G. OPV device performance is slightly higher than for PCPDTBT synthesised using more established techniques. This is the first known report of a working device with an active layer polymer synthesised using the direct heterolytic arylation route. The stability of the PCPDTBT material was tested using a combination of OPV device data and analytical instruments. From device data, PCPDTBT was shown to be less stable than the more commonly reported P3HT material. Significantly, processing additives used to optimise the active layer morphology, are shown to be detrimental to long-term performance, approximately halving the device half-life (T50%). The physical changes are examined using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and show that the inclusion of processing additives leads to greater morphological changes during ageing experiments. The chemical changes occurring in PCPDTBT were examined using XPS and show that light soaking leads to observations of severe oxidation, with a break-up of the aromatic rings, formation of sulphates at the thiophene ring, chain scission in the polymer backbone and loss of side chains. However, it is concluded that morphological changes are mostly responsible for the observed decrease in OPV device PCE. PCPDTBT with thermally initiated cross-linking behaviour is characterised and used to fabricate OPV cells. Cross-linkable PCPDTBT demonstrates a PCE of 3.65%, which is similar to its non-cross-linkable analogue, however, improved stability is observed from ageing experiments. This increase in stability, investigated further using AFM and GISAXS, is a result of fewer morphological changes in the active layer. While the work has focussed on PCPDTBT, many of the conclusions regarding the analysis of material degradation could be of wider interest to the field. The analysis could provide some new insights, on the degradation and stability of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives."
238,,2014.0,Untersuchung des Einflusses der Matrix und photoprotektiver Additive auf die Eigenschaften von Fluorophoren mittels Einzelmolekülspektroskopie,"Due to its easy detectability fluorescence is widely used in spectroscopy to investigate a variety of chemical and biochemical samples. The characteristics of fluorescence like intensity, lifetime, anisotropy and quantum yield contain information about electronic structure, mobility and orientation of fluorophores and they depend on the fluorophores environment. This interaction was used to characterize the environment as well as to tune the fluorophores. The first goal of this work was to investigate the feasibility of fluorescence-based local force probes for polymers under tension, using the fluorescence signal of an oligoparaphenylenevinylene derivative (OPV 5) with a twisted molecular backbone. Improved optical sensors of this type should in principle be able to monitor local mechanical stress in transparent samples down to the single molecule level, which harbors promising applications in polymer and nano science and technology. To investigate correlations between the impact of an external mechanical force on the molecular framework of fluorophores and the resultant changes of their fluorescence properties OPV 5 was used to dope thin foils made of PVC. The foils were stretched by applying uniaxial force and three major optical effects were observed simultaneously. First, the fluorescence anisotropy increased, which indicates a reorientation of the fluorophores within the matrix. Second, the fluorescence lifetime decreased by approximately 2.5 % (25 ps). Finally, an increase of the emission energy of about 0.2% (corresponding to a blue-shift of 1.2 nm) was observed. In addition, analogous measurements with Rhodamine 123 as an inert reference dye showed only minor effects which can be attributed to matrix effects due to refractive index changes. To relate the observed spectroscopic changes to the underlying changes in molecular properties, the measured optical effects where compared to quantum-chemical calculations. Both, the observed blue-shift of fluorescence and the reduced lifetime of OPV 5 under tensile stress are consistent with the results of the semiempirical calculations. The accuracy of a fluorescence signal is limited by the number of detected photons, hence it is important to investigate and extend the fluorescence photon emission capabilities of fluorophores. Therefore the second goal of this work was to optimize the fluorescence signal of a fluorophore. In this context, three different additives which enhance the fluorescence signal were investigated as selective quenchers for triplet or radical states of Rhodamine 110 (Rh 110): 1) mainly triplet state quencher 4-(phenylazo)-benzoic acid (AZB-C) 2) the triplet and radical cation state quencher 4-(phenylazo)anilin-benzoic acid (A-AZB-C) 3) the strong antioxidant 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2- carboxylic acid (Trolox). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in combination with power plot analysis was used to describe the entire fluorescence output according to a derived kinetics model for excitation and fluorescence of Rh 110. Under air saturated conditions the triplet and radical cation states were observed as dark states of Rh 110, where the radical cation state was the major populated state. Hence the application of quencher A-AZB-C which effectively prevented the triplet and radical formation even at high excitation irradiance led to strongest enhancement of the fluorescence signal. At an excitation irradiance of 1 MW/cm² and 600 µM A-AZB-C a tenfold increase of the fluorescence countrate to approximately 2.4 MHz was observed. The application of the mainly triplet quenching AZB-C led to a significantly smaller enhancement of the fluorescence signal. At the same excitation irradiance of 1 MW/cm² and a concentration of 800 µM only a six times increased fluorescence countrate was observed. In case of application of the strong antioxidant Trolox the formation of an additional dark state, the radical anion state, was observed. Hence the enhancement of fluorescence signal with Trolox alone was similar to AZB-C. It was possible to quench effectively the radical anion state observed in the presence of Trolox with AZB-C. Consequently the enhancement of fluorescence signal in the presence of a mixture between Trolox and AZB-C was similar like with A-AZB-C alone. Additionally the photo destruction reaction of Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) and the impact of the additives A-AZB-C and AZB-C on the photo stability of Rh 123 were investigated. It was found that the main pathway for the photo destruction reaction of Rh 123 in the presence of oxygen proceeds via the first excited singlet state of Rh 123. For this reason the investigated additives had only weak influence on the photo stability of Rh 123 in the presence of oxygen. Under deoxygenated conditions the photo stability of Rh 123 was increased by a factor of ten if the additive A-AZB-C or AZB-C with concentrations of 100 µM were added to the dye solution. Especially in single molecule detection (SMD) techniques with short dwell times of the fluorophores in the confocal volume, where only small numbers of fluorescence photons can be collected from each fluorophore, the enhancement of the fluorescence signal can significantly improve the measurements. Short dwell times can be also a result of directed flow. Therefore the third goal of this work was the application of additives for compensation of fluorescence photon loss under flow conditions. In this context, the fluorescence signals from Rh 123 and Rh 110 at flow conditions were investigated, using a combination of a single molecules detection fluorescence setup with a microfabricated diffusive mixer (micromixer). The quantitative analysis of SMD measurements in the micromixer requires the characterization of the flowpattern. One approach for calculating the flow in microchannels is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Here the fabrication precision of microchannels in general limits the accuracy of numerical calculations. At the same time FCS as experimental approach can probe the flow velocity in microchannels directly. However the characterization of flow pattern by FCS is limited by photon statistics and positioning accuracy of the confocal volume in the microchannels. At the same time the characterization of the flow pattern by FCS demands many single FCS measurements. Using the complementary combination of CFD with FCS it was possible to overcome most of the limitations of both methods. Thus a small number of FCS measurements provided necessary information for accurate numerical calculation of the flow pattern. Vice versa the knowledge of the flow pattern in combination with FCS provided the accurate position of the confocal volume inside of a microchannel. Moreover using the calculated flow velocity for calibration of the confocal volume in single focus FCS measurements it was possible to estimate the precise value for the diffusion coefficient of Rh 110 The time resolution of the micromixer is set by the time required for diffusively mixing and the dwell time needed to collect a given number of photons. In fact, the flow induced photon loss limited the maximum flow velocity for SMD measurements to 4 µm/ms, which degraded the maximum time resolution of the used micromixer from 1.8 ms to 3 ms. One approach to collect enough fluorescence photons at high flow is to increase the excitation intensity, however this alone is unsatisfactory since it increases the probability to populate long lived triplet and radical states. The application of the dark state quencher A-AZB-C with 400 µM concentration in combination with a high excitation irradiance of 170 kW/cm² SMD measurements of Rh 123 improved the fluorescence signal by a factor of four. Thereby the flow induced photon loss was compensated, so that the time resolution of the micromixer was finally limited only by the time required for diffusively mixing."
239,10.18520/CS/V107/I9/1377-1379,2014.0,A case of polymer photovoltaics in India,"Polymer solar cells are light weight, flexible and inexpensive. There has been great progress in three important aspects of polymer solar cells in the last decade, i.e. efficiency, stability and processing. The efficiencies of single-junction solar cells have been improved by stacking two or more complementary single cells in the form of tandem cells. There has been tremendous progress in roll-to-roll processing of single and tandem cells resulting in the setting up 1 GW solar power parks in Denmark and south of Spain. India has an ambitious programme of setting up solar energy power houses up to 300 GW by 2030. However, subcritical research and development is taking place in the field of polymer solar cells in India. It is high time we decide to pursue intensive polymer photovoltaics in the country. Following the commentary by Bose, I discuss here polymer photovoltaics in India. The progress in polymer photovoltaics has no parallel in any technological growth in the world. Polymer solar cells being light weight, flexible and inexpensive can be produced by cheap low-temperature solution processing. Three important aspects of polymer solar cells, i.e. efficiency, stability and processing have shown tremendous progress. Tang reported the first polymer solar cell in 1986 using bilayer structure demonstrating a power conversion efficiency of 1%. The last decade witnessed the impressive development in bulk heterojunction concept in polymer solar cell technology leading to the increase in single-junction cell efficiency from 4% in 2005 (refs 8 and 9) to state-of-the-art present-day efficiencies of 8–9% (refs 10–15; Figure 1). By optimization of materials with proper band gap (necessarily low band gap), energy levels and carrier mobility, efficiencies up to 10–12% are achievable in single-junction solar cells. The organic tandem solar cells comprising two series-connected single cells and covering complementary solar spectra can reach theoretical Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of 15% (refs 17 and 18). You et al. have demonstrated an efficiency of 10.6% in solution-processed tandem cells (Figure 2). Heliatek Co, Germany has recently demonstrated certified 12% efficiency in a vacuumprocessed small-molecule organic triplejunction device with an active area of > 1 cm. There has been remarkable progress in the stability of bulk heterojunction solar cells in the last ten years. There are various degradation phenomena taking place in polymer solar cells. When the device is illuminated, complex chemical reactions of organic semiconductors with oxygen and moisture have been observed. Similarly, interface is another source of degradation. The diffusion of the electrode materials into an active layer, acidity of the poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)– polystyrene-para-sulfonic acid (PEDOT : PSS) layer and change of morphology of active layer are some reasons for the degradation of polymer solar cells. These instabilities can be significantly reduced by appropriate encapsulation. Flexible poly(3-hexyl thiophene) : (6,6)-phenylC61-butyric methyl ester) (P3HT : PC61BM), organic photovoltaics (OPV) devices encapsulated with food-quality packaging barrier film have shown a lifetime over 1200 h. Where a higher quality barrier film was used, lifetimes of 4000 h (at 65C/85% relative humidity) have been achieved. Peters et al. recently reported a lifetime of 7 years for poly[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl2,5-thiophenediyl]–(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric methyl-ester (PCDTBT–PCBM) solar cells. An inter-laboratory outdoor stability study of flexible roll-to-roll coated organic photovoltaic modules (P3HT : PCBM inverted architecture) in different geographical locations from the southern and northern hemispheres has been undertaken. The most stable modules have demonstrated lifetime of more than 10,000 h and sub-cell analyses revealed stability of up to 17 months. Development has also taken place in the processing of polymer solar cells resulting in the setting up 1 GW solar power parks in southern Spain and Denmark. Spin coating is the most popular method in OPV device fabrication in research laboratories. Various printing and coating techniques have been found compatible to fast roll-to-roll processing. In the past it was confined to single donor– acceptor polymer solar cells. Frederic Krebs and his research team at the Technical University of Denmark have demonstrated for the first time the successful roll-to-roll manufacture of tandem OPV modules, each comprised of a stack of 14 discrete layers which are rapidly printed, coated or deposited on top of another by a machine reminiscent of a printing press (Figure 3). The processing was carried out under simple conditions; it is very fast with single solar cell module being printed onto blank foil each second. The whole processing is cheap"
240,10.3109/03639045.2010.535823,2011.0,Early development evaluation of AZD8081: a substrate for the NK receptors,"The purpose of the present study was to find out if AZD8081, a dual neurokinin (NK)1/2 receptor antagonist, was suitable for development of an oral, solid immediate release (IR) formulation and in a further perspective also as an oral extended release (ER) formulation. AZD8081 is a base with pKa values <2.5 and about 8.5. The measured intrinsic solubility is about 0.1 mg/mL and the solubility in FaSSIF (fasted simulated small intestinal fluid) is about 3.2 mg/mL. Aqueous buffer solutions are stable for at least 1 month between pH 1–7 up to 37°C. In the solid-state, a mixture of amorphous and crystalline substance showed significant chemical instability in the initial stress testing studies. No degradation was, however, observed for highly crystalline material at similar conditions. It is concluded that the impurity profile and/or the present solid-state of the batches affect the stability of the substance. The amorphous contribution of the substance is the main cause to the observed degradation in solid-state. Crystalline AZD8081 is polymorphic with two known monotropic forms, form A and form B. Both forms are only slightly hygroscopic ansolvates with melting points of approximately 108°C and 117°C, respectively. Form B is the more stable of the two forms and is therefore most suited for further development. The candidate is suitable for development of standard IR formulations since no specific limitations of significance for formulation development were identified. In addition, the good stability in human intestinal fluid and in colon slurry makes AZD8081 a suitable candidate for ER formulation."
241,10.1002/POLA.24742,2011.0,Novel macrothiols for the synthesis of a structurally comprehensive dendritic library using thiol–ene click chemistry,"In the last decades, the fabrication of ordered nano- and microporous structures has attracted increasing interest due to their specific properties and multiple possible applications in electronics, as templates or in the biological field. The development of such materials has been favored by the introduction of the simple breath-figure templating method in the 1990’s. In order to fully exploit the potential of these porous materials, the use of advanced functional molecules as precursors is essential. One suitable class of molecules is the well-defined linear-dendritic hybrids (LD hybrids) family. The structural variations, multiple end-groups and possible amphiphilicity of these molecules are significant advantages that could lead to highly sophisticated functional materials with potential usage in biology. Therefore, this project was directed towards the synthesis of advanced LD hybrids and the evaluation of their ability to form ordered functional porous films.A degradation and toxicity study was initially conducted on polyester-based 2,2-bis(methylol)propionic acid (bis-MPA) dendrimers under physiological conditions to support the potential usage of these molecules for biological purposes. The materials were found to undergo a relatively fast depolymerization process at pH 7.5. Moreover, the initial dendrimer and its decomposition products were proven to be non-toxic for immune competent cells, allowing for the utilization of these molecules for biological applications.A linear-dendritic-linear hybrid library was successfully synthesized from biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and bis-MPA building blocks using a combination of ring-opening polymerization (ROP)and copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). The materials, consisting of one long PEG block connected to the focal point of the dendron and several PCL arms attached at its periphery, were used to construct ordered porous films using the breath figure method. The polymeric architecture strongly affected the ordering of the films with a more regular morphology obtained from a more flexible polymer. Changing the semi-crystalline PCL to amorphous polylactide (PLA) also permitted the formation of porous arrays. Interestingly, films obtained from inverted structures possessing one long PCL block and several short PEG chains, also presented a regular morphology. Moreover they could be activated to exhibit multiple surface hydroxyl groups.To increase the number of orthogonal synthetic methodologies available for the preparation of advanced macromolecules, high molecular weight dendritic macrothiols were synthesized. These molecules were efficiently coupled to a number of core molecules via thiol-ene coupling, generating a comprehensive library of dendritic materials. This approach represents an attractive alternative to the commonly used, but potentially toxic, CuAAC.Exploiting the obtained results, a final LD hybrid was synthesized from atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) derivatives and thiol-ene coupling (TEC) with macrothiols. This macromolecule was successfully utilized to form functional ordered porous arrays and the availability of peripheral alkyne functional groups was demonstrated by efficient coupling with fluorescent Rhodamine-B. The HEMA-backbone allowed for the introduction of cross-linkable azide groups that were used to significantly improve the thermal stability of the films from 50 °C to 200 °C. These materials have the potential to be used in applications such as catalysis, in medicine and as sensors."
242,10.1021/bm701049g,2008.0,Chitosan film as rhBMP2 carrier: delivery properties for bone tissue application.,"Tissue engineering approaches need biomaterials with suitable properties to provide an appropriate environment for cell attachment and growth. The performance of these biomaterials can be greatly enhanced through the incorporation of bioactive agents. For this reason, we developed chitosan films with cell-attachment ability, rhBMP-2 carrier capacity, and good in vivo performance, and we employ them as covering for implantable materials. In this work, we have tried to explain how the rh-BMP2 is delivered to the surroundings from the development chitosan films. Protein diffusion from film, film stability versus in vitro dissolution, and biodegradation were evaluated to study rhBMP-2 delivery. Our results show that chitosan film has sufficiently good features to be used as an rhBMP-2 carrier. A low diffusion rate was observed, which was sufficient to quickly induce an in vitro differentiation stimulus, although heavily activated films retain more than 80-85% of the protein on the film. On the other hand, we estimated that chitosan film dissolution due to initial acidification in the wound environment is no more than 15-20%. We also estimated chitosan film response to lysozyme and concluded that degradation via this process proceeded at a slow kinetic rate. In addition, rhBMP-2 in vitro activity after film processing, as well as in vivo film behavior, were studied. We confirm that rhBMP-2 remains active on the film and after release, both in vitro and in vivo. These results support the conclusion that the developed chitosan film allows sustained release of the rhBMP-2 osteoinductive protein and could be used as an activated coat for implant and surgical prosthesis."
243,10.1002/pssa.201532950,2016.0,Effect of additional electron acceptor in hybrid P3HT:PCBM:ZnO spin‐coated films for photovoltaic application,"Concerted efforts need to be undertaken to overcome limited efficiencies and instability issues in order to ensure a niche for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) in the PV market. Recent improvements on tandem structures aside, in order to achieve further improvements it is sensible to construct test‐case scenarios on bulk heterojunction cells. One aspect, involving the low mobility of charge carriers, caused by the short exciton diffusion length in the active layer, has been targeted. In this regard, attempts to incorporate inorganic semiconductors into organic blends in hybrid organic solar cells, in various configurations, have so far been promising. In this work, ZnO nanoparticles were mixed into the poly (3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blend, and used as additional acceptors of electrons in the active layer. Metal–oxide interface layers between the active layer and ITO and the top contact layer, respectively, were introduced in the solar cell to compensate for environmental degradation. Thermo‐gravimetric analyses of the active layers revealed improved thermal stability of P3HT upon incorporating ZnO in the polymer matrix. The photovoltaic properties demonstrated that the addition of ZnO nanoparticles in the P3HT:PCBM bulk‐heterojunction solar cell causes an increase in the power conversion efficiency, while excessive loading of ZnO decreases the efficiency."

Consequently, understanding device lifetime and mitigating degradation pathways have become vital to the success of a new industry. Historically, the active organic components are considered vulnerable to photo-oxidation and represent the primary degradation channel. We present several (shelf life and light soaking) studies pointing to the relative stability of the active layers and instabilities in commonly used electrode materials. We show that engineering of the metal electrode and hole/electron injection layer can lead to environmentally stable devices without encapsulation."
245,,2017.0,Chemically modified PTFE particles as solid lubricant additive for the fixation on substrate surfaces,During the irradiation of high molecular weight poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) in presence of oxygen perfluoroalkyl(peroxy) radicals and functional groups are formed which allow chemical coupling reactions (cc = chemical compatibilized) with oils and plastics. Contrary to the well-known inert properties of perfluorinated organic compounds high-effective additives can be produced by radiation modification and subsequent chemical compatibilization of such substances with olefinically unsaturated groups of oils/lubricants. By the irradiation process high molecular weight PTFE degrades by C-C and C-F bond scission to lower molecular weight PTFE microparticles which possess perfluoroalkyl(peroxy) radicals. These radicals are used for the chemical compatibilization reaction with olefinically unsaturated groups base oils. The tribological properties and the dispersion stability of the resulting oil-PTFE-cc (cc = chemical compatibilized) dispersions are significantly enhanced in comparison to physical mixture of oil and PTFE micropowder. These oil-PTFE-cc-dispersions show primarily anti-wear (AW) properties. The use of reactive groups (e.g. phosphite groups) in the oil gives the dispersions extreme pressure (EP) properties additionally. This article demonstrates the usefulness of the oil-PTFE-cc-dispersions in rolling bearings using phosphite-modified PTFE products as additive in lubricants (FE-8 test). The investigations are completed by the examination of roller elements by SEM/EDX analysis. A model is shown to explain the effect of phosphite groups on oxidic/hydrolytic metal surfaces.
246,10.1002/APP.13216,2004.0,Blends of poly(ε‐caprolactone‐b‐lactic acid) and poly(lactic acid) for hot‐melt applications,"The condensation reaction product of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and a hydroxyl-terminated four-armed poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) was studied by size-exclusion chromatography, DSC, and NMR. The use of both L-lactic acid (LLA) and rac-lactic acid (rac-LA) was studied and the use of two different catalysts, stannous 2-ethylhexanoate [Sn(Oct) 2 ] and ferrous acetate [Fe(OAC) 2 ], was also investigated. The thermal stability and adhesive properties were also measured for the different formulations. The characterization results suggested the formation of a blend of PLA and a block-copolyester of PLA and PCL. The results further indicated partial miscibility in the amorphous phase of the blend showing only one glass-transition temperature in most cases, although no randomized structures could be detected in the block-copolymers. The polymerization in the Fe(OAc) 2 -catalyzed experiments proceeded slower than in the Sn(Oct) 2 -catalyzed experiments. The discoloring of the polymer was minor when Fe(OAC) 2 was used as catalyst, but significant when Sn(Oct) 2 was used. The ferrous catalyst also caused a slower thermal degradation. Differences in the morphology and in the adhesive properties could be related to the stereochemistry of the poly(lactic acid)."
247,10.1149/ma2015-02/39/1623,2015.0,Synchrotron Based Structural Investigations of Mass-Selected PtxGd Nanoparticles and a Gd/Pt(111) Single Crystal for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction,"Gd/Pt(111) Single Crystal for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction DTU Orbit (20/10/2019) Synchrotron Based Structural Investigations of Mass-Selected PtxGd Nanoparticles and a Gd/Pt(111) Single Crystal for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hinders the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). The ORR activity is enhanced by alloying Pt with late transition 3d metals (i.e. Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu)1. However, these compounds tend to degrade in a fuel cell by dealloying. An alternative approach is to alloy Pt with rare-earth elements. Their highly negative alloying energy may provide them with kinetic stability against dealloying under reaction conditions. A recent publication from our group reported the high ORR activity and stability of polycrystalline Pt5Gd2. In this work, we present the experimental results of mass-selected PtxGd nanoparticles synthesized by gas aggregation after sputtering of an alloy target in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)3. PtxGd nanoparticles with nominal sizes of 3, 5, 7, and 9 nm were selected using time-of-flight mass filtering and deposited on glassy carbon (GC) disk electrodes. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements in 0.1 M HClO4 were used to measure the activity in comparison to pure Pt 4. The ORR specific activity increases with the nanoparticle size; a maximum mass activity is achieved with the 7 nm sample, ~3.6 A/mg Pt at 0.9 V. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest that the high ORR activity is due to a compressive strain exerted by the alloy core onto the Pt overlayer at the surface. The structure formed on these types of alloys2 is further elucidated using a Gd/Pt(111) single crystal. The alloy was prepared in UHV by depositing 150 Å of Gd followed by annealing, thus simulating a bulk single crystal. It was characterized in vacuo using low energy electron diffraction, ion scattering spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption of CO. Subsequently, the crystal was transferred to an electrochemical cell, where a 1 nm thick Pt overlayer was formed; this constitutes the active phase for oxygen reduction. Using synchrotron based grazing X-ray diffraction, we determine the structure of the alloy and the Pt overlayer. The diffraction contributions from the Pt overlayer is separated from the Pt5Gd alloy, and the analysis of both diffraction patterns are presented. By investigating such well-defined structures, we gain valuable scientific insight into the relationship between their structure and functionality. On the basis of this insight, we can develop even better catalysts for oxygen electroreduction. References 1. Chen, C. et al.

248,,2016.0,Design of porous nanostructured solid catalysts,"This thesis aims at developing and characterize novel porous nanostructered materials for heterogeneous catalysis. The catalysts are prepared with the goals of increased activity and stability in mind. This will result in lessened waste of precious elements, starting materials, and energy, for a more sustainable chemical industry. Chapter 1 gives a short introduction to the e ect of heterogeneous catalysis upon the current chemical industry. The scope of the thesis will also be sketched. Chapter 2 is a description of the methods used in the thesis, to characterize the materials produced. These include X-ray powder di raction, physisorption analysis, and electron microscopy. This include common use, and possible pitfalls. Chapter 3 is an introduction to zeolites and their properties, mainly shape selectivity and catalytic activity. The di usion limitations imposed by the porous system in zeolites will be examined as well, and strategies on how to overcome this limitations will be presented. Chapter 4 describes the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites with a carbon secondary hard template. The carbon is generated through the decomposition of methane over nickel nanoparticles. This is done as an in situ process, directly upon the silica source for the zeolite. This method is signi cantly cheaper than previously reported for carbon templates. This increases the feasibility of utilizing mesoporous zeolites for various applications. The mesoporous zeolite possessed a greater total pore volume, while still matching its conventional counterpart in terms of crystallinity and acidity. Samples of conventional and mesoporous zeolites were tested in a model catalytic reaction. Here, the mesoporous zeolite exhibited much higher conversion, which is contributed to the enhanced di usion. Chapter 5 explains the fundamentals of fuel cells, as a mean to transform chemical energy into electricity. The focus is on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), as the main technique explained. The chapter will also cover degradation mechanisms of the catalyst employed in PEMFC, such as carbon corrosion and particle agglomeration."
249,,2015.0,Synthesis and characterization of plasma polymer thin films from γ-terpinene for encapsulation of electronic devices,"The rapid development of polymers and polymer based materials is leading to a number of promising organic devices e.g., solar cells and solid-state lighting, advancing display technology, sensors, and thin-film transistors. One obstacle to this development is the susceptibility of these devices to water vapor and oxygen that causes rapid degradation in many organic electronic devices. In order to maintain the efficiency and guarantee the minimum lifetime needed for various applications, high barrier performance encapsulation materials and structures must be developed. In this work, radio frequency (RF) plasma deposited γ–terpinene thin films were considered as a potential candidate for OPVs, specifically as encapsulation coatings, and as insulating layers in flexible electronics. 
 
γ-terpinene is a non-synthetic isomeric hydrocarbon derived from Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil. Thin films from this monomer were fabricated using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition in this research work under varied process conditions. The resultant polymer, plasma polymerized γ-terpinene (pp–GT) thin films were found to be optically transparent, with refractive indices in a range of 1.57–1.58 (500 nm). The optical band gap (Eᵍ) of pp–GT thin films were ~3 eV that fell into the insulating Eᵍ region. Independent of deposition conditions, the surfaces were smooth and defect-free, with uniformly distributed morphological features. Films fabricated at higher deposition power displayed enhanced resistance to delamination and wear, and improved hardness, from 0.40 GPa (10 W) to 0.58 GPa (75 W). 
 
Investigations on the wetting, solubility and chemical composition of pp–GT thin films revealed that the polymers were structurally dissimilar to the original monomer and highly cross-linked. The polymer surfaces were hydrocarbon-rich, with oxygen present in the form of O–H and C=O functional groups. The oxygen content decreased with deposition power, with films becoming more hydrophobic and, thus, less wettable. The polymers were determined to resist solubilisation in solvents commonly used in the deposition of organic semiconducting layers, including chloroform and chlorobenzene, with higher stability observed in films fabricated at higher RF power. 
 
Electrically, pp–GT thin films were highly insulating, possessing decreasing conductivity from 1.39 × 10⁻¹²S/cm (10W) to 1.02 × 10⁻¹³S/cm (75W), attributed to the change in the chemical composition and structure of the polymer. At a frequency of 100 kHz, the dielectric constant varied from 3.69 (10 W) to 3.24 (75 W). The current density–voltage (J−V) characteristics revealed that at higher applied voltage region, Richardson Schottky conduction was the dominant DC conduction mechanism. 
 
pp–GT thin films were demonstrated to be optically, physically and chemically stable under the ambient conditions. The bulk of aging occurred after fabrication was attributed to oxidation and volumetric relaxation. Photostability experiments showed that photooxidation takes place under UV irradiation in oxygen–rich conditions. With UV–C light, photodegradation occurred by additional cleavage pathways. Photostability could be improved (UV-C) or completely achieved (UV-A) in an oxygen-poor environment. Finally, fully characterized pp–GT encapsulation layers were integrated with organic PCPDTBT:PC₇₀BM solar cell to validate the effectiveness of the barrier layers. The encapsulated solar cell exhibited very slow decrease in efficiency compared to the nonencapsulated device."
250,,2016.0,Synthesis and characterisation of interfacial layers in organic solar cells,"The quest for renewable energy sources has led to growing attention in the research of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), as a promising alternative to fossil fuels, since these devices have low manufacturing costs and attractive end-user qualities, such as ease of installation and maintenance. Wide application of OPVs is majorly limited by the devices lifetime. With the development of new encapsulation materials, some degradation factors, such as water and oxygen ingress, can almost be excluded, whereas the thermal degradation of the devices remains a major issue. Two aspects have to be addressed to solve the problem of thermal instability: bulk effects in the photoactive layer and interfacial effects at the photoactive layer/charge-transporting layers. In this work, the interface between photoactive layer and electron-transporting zinc oxide (ZnO) in devices with inverted architecture was engineered by introducing polymeric interlayers, based on zinc-binding ligands, such as 3,4-dihydroxybenzene and 8-hydroxyquinoline. Also, a cross-linkable layer of poly(3,4-dimethoxystyrene) and its fullerene derivative were studied. At first, controlled reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation was employed to achieve well-defined polymers in a range of molar masses, all bearing a chain-end functionality for further modifications. Resulting polymers have been fully characterised, including their thermal and optical properties, and introduced as interlayers to study their effect on the initial device performance and thermal stability. Poly(3,4-dihydroxystyrene) and its fullerene derivative were found unsuitable for application in devices as they increased the work function of ZnO and created a barrier for electron extraction. On the other hand, their parental polymer, poly(3,4-dimethoxystyrene), and its fullerene derivative, upon cross-linking, resulted in enhanced efficiency and stability of devices, if compared to control. Polymers based on 8-hydroxyquinoline ligand had a negative effect on the initial stability of the devices, but increased the lifetime of the cells under accelerated thermal stress. Comprehensive studies of the key mechanisms, determining efficiency, such as charge generation and extraction, were performed by using time-resolved electrical and spectroscopic techniques, in order to understand in detail the effect of the interlayers on the device performance. Obtained results allow deeper insight into mechanisms of degradation that limit the lifetime of devices and prompt the design of better materials for the interface stabilisation."

Emphasis was placed on relative humidity (RH) at the measurement site (as opposed to storage or conditioning RH). The films were plasticized with either triethyl citrate or diethyl phthalate. The results show that the films respond rapidly to changes in the environmental humidity. This in turn influences the data obtained from DMTA and tensile testing; thus, good control of the humidity is essential. Absorption isotherms have been obtained for the two types of films, and the results were interpreted in terms of the equilibrium moisture content which is determined by the polar nature of the plasticizer. This factor must be considered when formulating a film composition because moisture can, apart from its influence on mechanical properties, also speed the chemical degradation processes. When the stability of a film composition during storage is studied, the actual measurements on the films should preferably be done at 0% RH, irrespective of the storage RH. At 0% RH, the mechanical testing results will reflect the chemical stability correctly, without interference from plasticizing effect of absorbed water. A functionality test for films has been suggested: DMTA under isothermal conditions using either step or continuous humidity scans. Isothermal dynamic humidity scans on the DMTA were performed for the first time, and the utility of these measurements is discussed."
253,,,Application Considerations in System Integrity Protection Schemes ( SIPS ),"1. Abstract This paper describes some of the critical engineering, design, and applications of the latest technology for the implementation of System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS). Applicability of the advanced analytical techniques for various types of SIPS applications on the basis of modern technology is also addressed. An overview is presented of traditional scheme requirements leading to the SIPS of the future. A new survey is described in the paper, which should provide valuable information about power industry trends and experiences in SIPS. The electric power grid is the "" pivot point "" that balances the generation and load. Maintaining the integrity of this pivot point is imperative for the effective operation of interconnected power systems. As such, the balance of power is only as reliable as the weakest pivot point in the system. When a major disturbance occurs, protection and control actions are required to stop the power system degradation, restore the system to a normal state, and minimize the impact of the disturbance [1]. Control center operators must deal with a very complex situation and rely on heuristic solutions and policies [1], [2]. Local protection systems arrest the propagation of the fast-developing emergencies through automatic actions. Local protection systems, however, are not able to address the entire power system, which may be affected by the disturbance. The trend in power system planning utilizes tight operating margins, with less redundancy in the grid. At the same time, addition of non-utility generators and independent power producers, an interchange increase in a growing competitive environment and introduction of fast control devices make the power system more complex to operate. This changing environment highlights the need for automated systems with advanced monitoring and intuitive interface tools to enable real-time operator interactions. On the other hand, the advanced measurement devices and communication technology in wide-area monitoring and controls, FACTS devices (better operational and stability control), and new analytical and heuristic procedures provide better ways to detect and control an impending system collapse [3], [4], [5], [6]. Advanced detection and control strategies through the concept of System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) offer a cohesive management of the disturbances. SIPS is a concept of using system information from local as well as relevant remote sites and sending this information to a processing location to counteract propagation of the major disturbances in the power system.

254,10.1021/AC970395D,1998.0,Solid-phase microextraction with temperature-programmed desorption for the analysis of iodination disinfection byproducts.,"An analytical approach for the determination of chlorination and iodination disinfection byproducts based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was developed. Solid-phase microextraction presents a simple, rapid, sensitive, and solvent-free approach to sample preparation in which analytes in either air or water matrixes are extracted into the polymeric coating of an optical fiber. Analytes are subsequently thermally desorbed in the injection port of a gas chromatograph for separation, detection, and quantitation. Thermal degradation of iodoform was observed during desorption from a polyacrylate fiber in initial GC/MS and GC/ECD experiments. Experiments were designed to determine SPME conditions that would allow quantification without significant degradation of analytes. Isothermal and temperature-programmed thermal desorptions were evaluated for efficacy in transferring analytes with wide-ranging volatilities and thermal stabilities into chromatographic analysis columns. A temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) (120-200 degrees C at 5 degrees C/min with an on-column injection port or 150-200 degrees C at 25 degrees C/min with a split/splitless injection port) was able to efficiently remove analytes with wide-ranging volatilities without causing thermal degradation. The SPME-TPD method was linear over 2-3 orders of magnitude with an electron capture detector and detection limits were in the submicrogram per liter range. Precision and detection limits for selected trihalomethanes were comparable to those of EPA method 551. Extraction efficiencies were not affected by the presence of 10 mg/L soap, 15 mg/L sodium iodide, and 6000 mg/L sodium thiosulfate. The SPME-TPD technique was applied to the determination of iodination disinfection byproducts from individual precursor compounds using GC/MS and to the quantitation of iodoform at trace levels in a water recycle system using GC/ECD."

Aspects on conjugation chemistry and biodistribution.,"Boron-containing compounds like closo-dodecaborate(2-) are in theory suitable for radioactive labeling with halogens. The boron-halogen bond is stronger than carbon-halogen bond and is not likely to be recognized by deiodinating enzymes in vivo. Peptides and proteins may be conjugated with various closo-dodecaborate(2-)-containing ligands, and thereafter, the conjugate can be iodinated. Since closo-dodecaborate(2-) is more avidly iodinated than tyrosine in moderately acidic media, such conjugates may be directly labeled on the boron part with radioisotopes of iodine using the standard Chloramine-T procedure. Mercapto-undecahydro-closo-dodecaborate(2-) (BSH) was reacted with the double bond of allyldextran to form a boronated dextran compound of the molecular size of about 70 kDa. This compound, in the text denoted as Dx-BS, and cesium dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate(2-) were labeled using iodine-125. The two compounds were administered to rats in order to study their in vivo stability. The results indicate that iodinated Dx-BS is stable for about 20 h in vivo. The degradation rate, as indicated by thyroid uptake, was found low. [125I]Iodo-closo-dodecaborate(2-), which is a possible degradation product of [125I]Dx-BS-I, was rapidly excreted in urine without significant accumulation in any organ."

The encapsulation, for which EVA is used in most c-Si PV modules, is of great importance for the long-term stability of PV modules. Delamination between the encapsulation and the solar cell or the glass may occur whilst outdoor exposition. In order to understand the processes which take place at the EVA/Silicon and EVA/Air interface during exposure to UV radiation and elevated temperature, thin non-cross-linked EVA films, spin coated onto silicon substrates to a thickness of 80 and 95 nm, were made from commercial EVA foils and from EVA pellets without stabilizing agents. The samples were aged at different temperatures (23°C and 85°C) with and without UV radiation for 200 h. The topography and the material properties of the surface were measured every 40 hours by Tapping Mode AFM and Raman Spectroscopy. Thus, the temporal evolution of morphology changes could be examined. Surface crystallization was observed, especially for the irradiated samples. EVA films which were exposed to UV light at room temperature did not show any morphological changes, indicating the necessity of a certain temperature to trigger crystallization processes. The samples with non-stabilized EVA degraded faster than the samples with additives. The Raman Spectra of the non-stabilized EVA sample gave evidence for changes in the chemical structure of the material. This finding could explain the different surface structures observed in the AFM images."

Thermal stability of the bulk hybrid materials was examined by TGA, and films were examined by UV−vis spectroscopy following thermal treatment and photochemical irradiation.

259,,2013.0,Preservation of bacterial DNA by binding to dentin,"The fate of DNA from dead cells is an important issue when interpreting results from root canal infections analysed by the PCR technique. DNA from dead bacterial cells is known to be detectable long time after cell death and its stability is dependent on many different factors. This work investigated factors found in the root canal that could affect the recovery of microbial DNA. In an ex vivo experiment, DNA from non-viable gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis was inoculated in instrumented root canals and recovery of DNA was assessed by PCR over a two-year period. DNA was still recoverable two years after cell death in 21/25 teeth. The fate of DNA from the gram-negative bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and the gram-positive Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was assessed in vitro. DNA from dead F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius could be detected by PCR six months post cell death even though it was clear that the DNA was released from the cells due to lost of cell wall integrity during the experimental period. The decomposition rate of extracellular DNA was compared to cell-bound and it was evident that DNA still located inside the bacterium was much less prone to decay than extracellular DNA.Free (extracellular) DNA is very prone to decay in a naked form. Binding to minerals is known to protect DNA from degradation. The fate of extracellular DNA was assessed after binding to ceramic hydroxyapatite and dentine. The data showed that free DNA, bound to these materials, was protected from spontaneous decay and from enzymatic decomposition by nucleases.The main conclusions from this thesis were: i) DNA from dead bacteria can be detected by PCR years after cell death ex vivo and in vitro. ii) Cell-bound DNA is less prone to decomposition than extracellular DNA. iii) DNA is released from the bacterium some time after cell death. iv) Extracellular DNA bound to hydroxyapatite or dentine is protected from spontaneous decomposition and enzymatic degradation."
260,,2010.0,A Novel Approach for Efficient Utilization of Cotton into Nonwovens,"Smart textiles integrated with fiber shaped photovoltaic (PV) device could be used as a sustainable and ubiquitous power source for wearable and other electronic devices. In this study, effects of fabric structures on power conversion efficiency of PV fabrics were investigated. Three different PV fabrics were constructed: plain, 1⁄4 twill and 5 harness sateen on tapestry loom. Light and dark I-V characteristics of these PV fabrics were determined, to compare the performance of different PV fabrics. INTRODUCTION Fiber shaped organic photovoltaic (OPV) wires are the potential candidates for smart PV fabric applications because of their flexibility and weavability. The fiber shaped OPV wires are still in its infant stage and the efficiency of these wires is still lower than <1% [1,2] as compared to 5% of their flat organic counterpart. The OPV fiber (Konarka Technologies, Inc., Lowell, MA) is a flexible wire shaped PV cell based on nanostructure bulk heterojunction composites [3]. A phase separated, OPV layer, comprises of conductive polymer poly (3hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor material and fullerene derivative, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor material. The OPV layer is coated onto a thin metal primary electrode (cathode) wire made of stainless steel. A second wire, serve as a secondary electrode (anode), made of stainless steel wire coated with silver particles [3]. The electrical contacts between the two wires are established by wrapping secondary electrode wire around the PV coated primary electrode wire [3]. The two wire system is then encased into protective transparent outer polymer cladding. Experimental OPV fiber was obtained in spool form and stored in a controlled environment. PV fabric samples were woven on Mirrix Zach Tapestry Loom (Mirrix Tapestry & Bead Looms, Francestown, NH) with three different fabric structures, i.e. plain, 1⁄4 twill and 5 harness sateen weave, and with the following specifications: fabric length 5.08 cm, fabric width 10.16 cm, epcm 15.74 cm, ppcm 6.3. For warp, 30 Tex white polyester yarn was used and for weft, three picks of OPV fibers were weaved after every five picks of polyester yarn. The crimp in the OPV fiber was measured using the crimp tester (ASTM D 3883). We connected serially four sets of three picks/set of OPV fiber to make PV woven panel. The light I-V characteristics of PV woven panels were determined on solar I-V tester, ORIEL 6271 (Newport Corporation, Stratford, CT) equipped with AM 1.5 filter. The irradiance from the solar I-V tester was set at 100 mW/cm. The dark I-V characteristics were determined using reversed biased I-V measurement. The voltage is sourced (KEITHLEY 617 programmable electrometer) from 0 V to a voltage level where the device begins to break down. The resulting current is measured and plotted as a function of the applied voltage. The projected area of the OPV fiber was taken as its length multiplied by the diameter of the primary electrode wire, i.e. 0.01016 cm. Various PV parameters were determined from the I-V characteristic curves, i.e. maximum power point, fill factor and power conversion efficiency [4]. Eq. (1), (2) and (3) shows the maximum power, fill factor and power conversion efficiency calculation. Maximum Power Pmax = Vmax*Imax (1) Fill Factor FF = (Vmax*Imax)/(Voc*Isc) (2) Efficiency % = Pmax/Pin*100 (3) RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crimp in the yarn was measured by taking out three picks of OPV fiber (length 30.48 cm) and then straightens the OPV fiber such that there is no waviness present in the fiber. The percentage excess length of OPV fiber over the initial length is expressed in terms of crimp values. Table I show the crimp values for different PV fabrics. TABLE I: Crimp values for different PV fabrics. Fabric Initial Length Final Length Crimp Plain PV fabric 30.48 cm 32.30 cm 6.0% 1⁄4 twill PV fabric 30.48 cm 31.54 cm 3.5% 5 harness sateen PV fabric 30.48 cm 31.39 cm 3.0% The light I-V characteristics of 30.48 cm long OPV fiber and different PV woven panels consisting of 129.2 cm (plain)126.16 cm (1/4 twill) – 125.56 cm (5 harness sateen) long OPV fiber were determined and shown in figure 1 and 2. Table II shows various photovoltaic parameters for OPV fiber and PV fabrics calculated from light I-V characteristic curves. From Table II we can see that the efficiency of OPV fiber is ~0.96% as compared to ~3.0% for same fiber reported by Lee et al [5]. Lee at el reported ~3.0% efficiency for freshly prepared OPV fiber, but the OPV fiber we tested is already 1 year old and the PV layer has been degraded likely due to the inadequate barrier properties of the polymer cladding to moisture and oxygen. Very little information is available regarding stability of the OPV fiber at this time. FIGURE 1: IV characteristic curve of OPV fiber. FIGURE 2: IV characteristic curves for different PV fabrics TABLE II: Photovoltaic parameters for OPV fiber and PV fabrics.

Moreover, within the different PV fabrics, we see variations in the efficiency value and is maximum for 5 harness sateen PV fabric, i.e. 0.32% and minimum for plain PV fabric, i.e. 0.23%, whereas for 1⁄4 twill PV fabric, it lies in between, i.e. 0.28%. This lower efficiency in case of PV fabrics as compared to individual OPV fiber is due to the shadowing of parts of the OPV fibers and due to several resistive losses, i.e. losses due to electrical connections, resistive losses due to the stainless steel wire substrate and electrical contacts between the two electrode wire. The dark I-V measurements for 30.48 cm long OPV fiber and different PV woven panels were carried out to determine the diode properties and different PV parameters. In order to determine these parameters, the dark I-V characteristics were plotted on semi log scale and the curve is divided into three regimes [5]: I. At low positively biased voltage, the parallel resistance Rp, limits the current through an OPV cell. II. At moderate bias voltage, current through an OPV cell is controlled by the diode properties. III. At higher voltage, the series resistance Rs, limits the current through an OPV cell. The dark I-V characteristic results show that the different fabric structures affects the series resistance of the OPV fiber. Series resistance is maximum in case of plain PV fabric (1184 Ω) and is minimum in case of 5 harness sateen (318 Ω). This is because of the following reasons: the crimp in the yarn (TABLE I) that leads to extra length of OPV fiber per pick, the bending of OPV fiber at the point of interlacement may disturbed the electrical contact points between the two electrodes and the shadowing of textile yarns on the OPV fiber.

The experimental results suggests that 5 harness sateen woven PV fabrics gives better efficiency as compared to 1⁄4 twill and plain woven PV fabrics. FUTURE WORK PV fabric geometrical model will be developed to understand the effects of fabric structures on power conversion efficiency of the PV fabrics.

Transmission electron microscopy micrographs showed that 75% of the clay platelets were completely exfoliated. This high degree of exfoliation resulted in a large improvement in thermal stability and UV absorption properties without sacrificing optical clarity. Cone calorimetry tests clearly showed that the heat release rate was far lower and more gradual in the nanocomposites than in pure resins. Thermal gravimetric analysis measurements showed that the thermal stability of nanocomposites was enhanced by almost 50°C (at 50 wt% loss) when the samples were thermally degraded under nitrogen. These results are consistent with a dramatic increase in the specific heat of the nanocomposites as verified by high precision differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Additionally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results indicated that the introduction of clay did not change the chemical structure of acrylic resins."
262,10.1046/J.1523-1755.2003.08811.X,2003.0,Clinical trial experiences with Physioneal.,"The kidneys play an important role in maintaining the acid-base balance, as they excrete hydrogen ions and regenerate bicarbonate, thereby regulating intra- as well as extracellular pH, which are vital for normal cell function. In patients with renal failure, the inability of the kidneys to excrete an excess of hydrogen ions results in metabolic acidosis due to retention of acid degradation products, which has a detrimental effect on protein as well as amino acid turnover and leads to hypercatabolism1. In these patients, treatment with bicarbonate has been shown to improve nitrogen balance and decrease both whole body amino acid oxidation and protein degradation2. Metabolic acidosis also negatively affects cardiac, as well as bone, function. Consequently, one of the most important objectives of any dialysis therapy, including peritoneal dialysis (PD), is to correct acidosis. The correction of acidosis in PD is generally more stable than what can be achieved with intermittent hemodialysis3, and this may be one of the most important advantages of PD compared to hemodialysis. Historically, bicarbonate was the first buffer used in PD to correct uremic acidosis. However, the use of this buffer was soon discontinued due to its poor stability in the PD solution4. In a search for alternative buffering agents, bicarbonate was replaced by either lactate or acetate. Both buffers maintain effective acid-base balance as they react with hydrogen ions derived from carbonic acid, thereby regenerating bicarbonate. Acetate, however, was subsequently found to be associated with loss of ultrafiltration and sclerosing peritonitis5. Its use was abandoned in the 1980s, leaving lactate as the only buffer used in PD for many years."
263,,2010.0,Rational Design and Preparation of Organic Semiconductors for use in Field Effect Transistors and Photovoltaic Cells,"The goal of this research was to develop methods to control the material properties of organic semiconductors, like solubility, stability, charge mobility, and self-assembly, through structural design. Investigations of structure-property relationships were conducted to optimize the properties of organic semiconductors for applications in organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).Chapter 1 gives an introduction to charge transport in organic semiconductors, and describes how the structure of conjugated molecules can affect their electrical performance and facilitate facile solution deposition. Furthermore, factors that can affect the stability of organic semiconductors to ambient conditions are discussed. Also, the device characteristics of OFETs and OPVs are summarized as a reference for subsequent chapters.Chapter 2 discusses the investigation of the air stability of distyryl oligothiophenes in OFETs. This work made use of thermally labile solubilizing groups to facilitate solution deposition of the oligothiophenes. In addition to device characterization, an extensive analysis of the thin film morphology using AFM, NEXAFS and GIXD is presented. This work revealed the general stability of distyryl oligothiophenes to oxidative degradation, and the high degree of crystallinity in our thin films.In Chapter 3, the charge transporting properties of pentathiophene monolayer islands is analyzed using current sensing AFM. The pentathiophenes were prepared with carboxylic acid moieties for self assembly, and the sub-monolayer films were transferred onto conductive substrates using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The morphology of the monolayers was observed to be sensitive to the alkyl substitution pattern of the pentathiophenes, which in turn affected charge transport. Hierarchical supramolecular assemblies of oligothiophenes and block copolymers are studied in Chapter 4. The structure of the assemblies is studied by TEM and small angle X-ray scattering, confirming successful formation of supramolecular assemblies. Thin films are studied further by grazing incidence X-ray scattering, and their charge transporting properties are evaluated in OFETs. This work demonstrates that non-covalent self-assembly can be used to access nanostructured thin films of functional organic semiconductors.Finally, Chapter 5 discusses the photophysical, morphological, and electronic properties of boron(subphthalocyanine)s with conjugated axial ligands. The tendency of these materials to form polycrystalline films instead of amorphous films was shown to be very sensitive to axial ligand structure and coordination geometry. The morphology of thin films was also shown to affect OPV device characteristics, with crystalline films supplying higher photocurrents."

The results showed that Teragard formulation was the lowest in its content of sulfotep than both Dursban and Bestban formulations where the level of sulfotep as micrograms was 53.71, 164.96 and 323.92 for Teragard, Dursban and Bestban, respectively. Also results show that chlorpyrifos a.i. in all tested formulations was unstable when exposure to high degrees of temperature (45and50°C), while Sulfotep is relatively stable. The loss of the active ingredient (a.i) in chlorpyrifos formulations Teragard, Bestban and Dursban was 89.07, 87.96 and 88.63%, respectively after 144 hours of exposure to 5o°C; while the percentage loss of sulfotep was 33.22, 23.56 and 13.41 % for Teragard, Dursban and Bestban, respectively after 144 hours of exposure to this temperature. The data showed that exposure to direct sunlight was more effective in chlorpyrifos degradation in its formulations than exposure to UV-rays where, the percentage loss of chlorpyrifos (a.i) in its tested formulation were 92.72, 90.69 and 91.08% after 48 hours of exposure to direct sunlight for Teragard, Dursban and Bestban, respectively and the percentage loss of sulfotep was 37.61, 25.77 and 15.76% after 48 hours of exposure to direct sunlight for Teragard, Dursban and Bestban, respectively.

265,,2007.0,MICROPHONICS IN CW TESLA CAVITIES AND THEIR COMPENSATION WITH FAST TUNERS,"Superconducting linac cavities of single pass Free Electron Lasers or Energy Recovery Facilities have a very low or near zero beamloading and are thus operated at a high quality factor with a narrow RF resonance, respectively. Following the phase and amplitude stability of the RF field is very easily degraded by any kind of mechanical detuning. In CW operation microphonics is the main error source for cavity detuning. To achieve high field stabilities in the regime of 0.02 ◦ in phase and 1·10 −3 down to 1·10 −4 in amplitude a fast tuning system is mandatory to compensate the detuning. In this paper the microphonics detuning measured at HoBiCaT will be shown and analyzed with respect to a detuning controller application. The controller design is given by a combination of a feedback and adaptive feedforward approach based on fast piezo tuners implemented in the Saclay coarse tuner designs. It will be shown, that at 1.8 K and loaded quality factors between 3·10 7 -1·10 8 a compensation of a least a factor of two up to seven is achievable."
266,,2004.0,ard-): A human gene that reverses the effects of temperature- sensitive and deletion mutations in the Escherichia coli rne gene,"The Escherichia colt me gene affects a variety of bacterial functions, induding the activity of RNase E. We report the existence of a human gene (ard-), for activator of RNA decay) that complements temperature-sensitive and deletion mutations of me in E. colU, allowing growth of medefective cells, correcting abnormal cell shape, activating chemical decay of bulk mRNA, and producing site-specific cleavages characteristic of RNase E in vivo and in vitro. ardnencodes a higly basic 13.3-kDa proline-rich peptide that has features in common with Rne and also with eukaryotic proteins implicated in RNA binding and macromolecular transport. The rne (also known as ams or hmpl) locus of Escherichia coli, which is essential for bacterial cell growth, affects the activities of RNases E, K, P, III, and F and the overall stability of bulk RNA (1). While there is substantial evidence that rne encodes at least the catalytic activity ofRNase E (2, 3), the Rne protein may also include domains important in RNA binding or macromolecular transport (4, 5). Additionally, two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations that have pleiotropic effects on rne function alter a region ofthe Rne protein that resembles CafA, a bacterial protein recently implicated in maintaining the elongated cell shape characteristic of E. coli cells-raising the possibility that the rne gene product may also have a structural role (6, 7). Consistent with the notion that the first biological molecules were RNAs rather thanDNA or proteins (8) is evidence that mechanisms for RNA processing and decay are very ancient and highly conserved evolutionarily (9-11). The experiments reported here were initiated to facilitate phylogenetic analysis ofendonucleolytic decay mechanisms and to identify eukaryotic genes specifying functions analogous to those encoded by rne. We report the existence of a human gene named activator of RNA decay (ard-1)* that reverses the pleiotropic effects of ts and deletion mutations in rne. This gene encodes a 13.3-kDa protein that has features in common with the E. coli rne gene product and with eukaryotic proteins implicated in endocytosis, macromolecular transport, and RNA binding. MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains, Plasmids, and Bacterial Phages. The ts E. coli HAK117 and N3431, which carry the re-i (12) and rne-3071 (13) mutations, respectively, have been described. KW086 (MC1061 recA rnets zce-726::TnlO) and KW087(rne+), which are congenic except at the rme locus, were constructed by phage P1 transduction (14) using donor strain CH1828 (15). HAK117-AKC was produced by lysogenizing the rnets mutant strain HAK117 with AKC helper phage (16). AYES (16) phage containing a human cDNA library prepared from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes (16) was kindly provided by Stephen Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston). pMW19 is a AYES-derived plasmid that lacks any cDNA insert. Restriction mapping and subcloning ofDNA for sequencing used the pUC18 plasmid in the DH5 host. Media and Growth Conditions. Luria broth (LB) liquid and solid medium containing appropriate antibiotics were used in these experiments, except where indicated; supplements of 0.4% maltose and 0.5 mM MgSO4/0.25 mM CaCl2 were added for A infection and P1 transduction experiments, respectively. Where indicated, isopropyl (3-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 5 mM (in liquid medium) or 1 mM (in solid medium). Transformations and other manipulations were done using standard procedures (17). Isolation of Complementing Plasmids. Approximately 5 x 106 phage from a AYES human lymphocyte cDNA library (16) were incubated with 5 x 108 HAK117 cells at 300C for 30 min without shaking. IPTG was added to 5 mM, and after further incubation with shaking for 2 h at 300C, phage-infected cells were plated on prewarmed (440C) LB plates containing kanamycin (Km, 25 ug/ml), ampicillin (Ap, 25 g/mil), and IPTG (1 mM) and then incubated at 440C. Bacterial colonies growing at 440C were purified twice by plating them in the presence of antibiotics at 300C and were tested again with or without IPTG for growth at 440C. DNA blot analysis of the human genomic DNA using the 32P-labeled Xho I-HindHI fragment of ard-) cDNA was done according to Sambrook et al. (17). Analysis of RNA Decay. Chemical decay of bulk RNA (12, 18), in vivo degradation of RNAI (19), and in vitro cleavage of 9S RNA (20) were analyzed as described. Radioactive 9S RNA and RNA probes complementary to RNAI were synthesized in vitro (21) using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) on plasmids pUC18T7/T3 pBRori (19) and pTH90 (22), respectively. Autoradiograph bands were scanned densitometrically (Molecular Dynamics 300S) for measurements of RNA half-life. Sequence Analysis. Deletion fragments of cloned cDNA were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chainterminating method (23). Bands were separated by electrophoresis on 6-8% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. Automated sequencing for fluorescence-labeled samples was carried out on an ABI model 373A sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of the nucleic acid and predicted protein sequences used the FASTDB 5.4 program of IntelliGenetics and the BLAZE 1.0 program (24).

267,10.1063/1.59749,1999.0,The role of RF in the optimized shear scenario on JET,"RF heating and current drive with ion cyclotron waves and Lower Hybrid waves have been crucial for the development of the Optimized Shear scenario on JET to high performance. Peaked electron temperature profiles and improved energy confinement could be obtained with electron heating both from LHCD and ICRH during plasma current ramp up. ICRH and NBI comparisons allow to separate heating and fueling and suggest a dominant role of core heating in the formation of an Internal Transport Barrier (ITB). ICRH and NBI powers are there equivalent. Pressure profile control by varying the composition of centrally peaked ICRF and broader NBI deposition improves MHD stability. Current profile modifications in a wide range have been obtained with LHCD and in combination with NBI during current ramp up. During the high performance phase, however, LH coupling degrades strongly due to the steep edge density gradient resulting in a drop of the density in front of the LH antenna to the cut-off density. High fusion performance achieving simultaneously high beta values and bootstrap currents is predicted in scenario modeling using pressure and current profile control with ICRF and LHCD."

 Analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by multiparameter immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy allows non-invasive characterization of cancer cell biomarker expression in real time. This information can be helpful in prognosis, treatment selection, and stratification of cancer patients. AccuCyte® is a density-based unbiased isolation method that transfers nucleated cells from whole blood to slides for the characterization of CTCs and other rare cells. RarePlex® panel kits are IF staining reagents used on automated slide staining instruments to label cells to differentiate CTCs from white blood cells (WBC). CyteFinder® is a seven-channel automated fluorescent imaging system that rapidly scans microscope slides and applies machine learning algorithms to identify CTCs. Together, these technologies provide an end-to-end solution for CTC characterization. For analysis, blood is drawn into AccuCyte blood collection tubes (BCTs) containing a preservative which maintains cell properties prior to processing onto slides. Once slides are prepared, they can be stored at -20°C without significant biomarker degradation. This flexible workflow allows investigators to bank samples for batch analysis and to begin sample collection prior to validating the IF assay to be used. This study was designed to evaluate: (1) stability time between collection in the AccuCyte BCT and sample processing; (2) performance of an improved version of the AccuCyte kit with higher nucleated cell isolation capacity; and (3) storage time that AccuCyte prepared slides can be banked frozen prior to staining. The study was performed using model CTCs and cancer patient samples. Metrics to determine performance were CTC recovery and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of biomarker expression. Our results demonstrate that the AccuCyte BCT preserves blood components for at least 5 days after collection without significant effect on CTC recovery or biomarker expression. The latest version of the AccuCyte kit demonstrated a higher cell isolation capacity and could collect up to 60% more nucleated blood cells than the previous version, increasing CTC recovery. The increased capacity was demonstrated in patients treated with hematopoietic growth factors, whose WBC count was significantly higher than the normal range. Finally, accelerated-aging study results demonstrated that AccuCyte-prepared slides can be stored at -20°C for at least 4 years without significant effect on most biomarkers tested. In conclusion, enhancements to the AccuCyte-CyteFinder platform reported here increase flexibility and performance for analysis of CTCs in global clinical trials by allowing longer periods of time before collected blood samples need to be processed and by extending the length of time processed slides can be banked before they are stained.

Delay-hardened hybrid PUF cells use differential clock delay insertion to favor circuit evaluation in the desired direction while leveraging burn-in-induced aging for selective bit destabilization enabling quick identification and masking of unstable cells, and subsequent temporal-majority-voting with soft dark-bit masking to reduce PUF bit error by 3.9 times to 1.45% resulting in ~5 ppb failure probability. A stable full-entropy 128-b key is finally generated from the 1024 raw PUF bits using BCH error correction and AES-CBC-based entropy extraction. An all-digital design with compact PUF cell layout occupying  $1.84~\mu \text{m}^{2}$  achieves: 1) 4-fJ/b energy-efficiency with 3-μW leakage at 0.65 V, 70 °C; 2) peak operating frequency of 1 GHz resulting in 1.2-μs key generation latency; 3) robust operation with stable key generation across 0.55–0.75 V, and 25 °C–110 °C; 4) 14 times separation between intra/inter-PUF hamming distances with 0.99993 entropy ensuring cryptographic quality randomness and uniqueness; 5) 48% higher PUF stability with long-term aging by leveraging transistor degradation to reinforce favorable cell bias; and 6) resiliency to power cycling attacks with common centroid clock routing measured from 49.5% hamming distance between array’s evaluation and wake-up states."
270,10.1002/jctb.6345,2020.0,Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) purification through dilute aqueous ammonia digestion at elevated temperatures,"BACKGROUND: Purification of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is a challenging step, given the difficulty of achieving high PHA purity, while maintaining polymer integrity, in a sustainable and cost‐efficient manner. This study evaluated the potential of dilute ammonia digestion as a method to purify PHA from mixed microbial consortia. RESULTS: Digestion temperatures were critical to the obtainable purity and the amount of recovered PHA. At temperatures below 75 °C (regardless of the incubation time and ammonia concentration), a low PHA recovery (down to 65%) and no increase in purity was observed. By increasing the temperature above 75 °C, a significantly higher PHA purity and higher recovery (above 90%) could be achieved. Temperatures maximizing the purity (140 °C) led to a detrimental reduction in the molar mass of the isolated PHA, but the use of a sonication pre‐treatment enabled to increase the purity at temperatures leading to limited molar mass loss (75–115 °C). The impurities still present in the recovered PHA did not compromise its thermal stability, and no significant degradation occurred during melting of PHA with 86% purity (comparably to pure chloroform‐extracted PHA). Conversely, PHA recovered through sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) digestion underwent severe degradation during melting, despite presenting higher purity (98%). CONCLUSIONS: High PHA purity, recovery and thermal stability can be obtained with dilute ammonia digestion. These observations, combined with the possibility of reusing ammonia within the process, make this method a promising approach for a more sustainable purification of PHA. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry"
271,10.1002/aenm.201100411,2011.0,BCP/Ag/MoO3 Transparent Cathodes for Organic Photovoltaics,"IO N Flexible solar cells have attracted attention due to their advantages in low cost roll-to-roll fabrication and potential application in fl exible electronic devices. [ 1–6 ] Typical fl exible solar cells on a transparent substrate compose of bottom anode, thin-fi lm semiconductor, and a top cathode. [ 4 ] When the plastic fi lm was used as the substrate, the direction of incoming light is from substrate, a front illumination. [ 7 ] However, there is a distinct disadvantage in the plastic substrate, a high water vapor permeation rate (10 1 –10 − 1 g/m 2 /day at 25 ° C). [ 8 ] Such problem could be solved by employing a thin metal foil and stainless steel substrate. However, those substrates are opaque. Thus the device structure of fl exible solar cells on the opaque substrate composed of a refl ective bottom anode, a thin-fi lm semiconductor, and a transparent top cathode, [ 4 ] leading to a back illumination structure. In this confi guration of fl exible solar cells, the light incomes from top transparent cathode and makes photoexcited electrons in the semiconductor materials. [ 9 ] Thus, high power conversion effi ciency (PCE) of solar cells could be achieved by improving the optical transmittance of cathode in the devices. However, because the transparent top cathode composed by thin-fi lm of metal layer such as Ag/ Al and Ag/Au has low transmittance ( < 60%), more than 40% of the incident light is refl ected at the surface of top electrode, resulting in low PCE (1.1%) of the organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells. [ 10 , 11 ] This low transmittance of the top cathode has become one of the main obstacles to achieve high effi ciency solar cells. Hence, several other techniques such as alkali metal/Ag double layer and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) cathode have been studied to improve the optical transmittance of top electrode. [ 12–17 ] When an alkali metal surface such as Ca, Li, or Ba was deposited prior to the Ag or Al thin fi lm, one could obtain a high transmittance value ( > 70%) and low sheet resistance ( ∼ 10 ohm/sq), [ 12 , 13 ] leading to an increased PCE (1.7%) of OPV cells. But, such alkali metals caused the degradation of OPVs during the operation because of their susceptibility of moisture which is one of the most important factors on OPV device stability. [ 18 , 19 ] TCO materials such as ZnO, IZO and ITO were another candidate for transparent cathode. [ 20–23 ] Even though the TCO electrode has a good conductivity and high transmittance to obtain a high effi ciency (1.5%) in OPV devices, it was suffering from"
272,,2017.0,"Removal of Direct Dye using Activated Carbon Prepared from Prosopis juliflora Bark: Isothermal, Thermodynamic and Kinetic Studies","Effluents discharged from textile, paper, rubber, plastics, leather, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and food industries have been found to be the main sources of water pollution. Textile industries discharge a lot of wastewaters containing different dyes like direct, reactive, mordant, acid and basic dyes. The direct dyes are the second largest dye class in the color index, which are used for dyeing rayon, linen, cellulosic fibers, wool and silk. Generally, dyes have a relatively low fixation degree on the textile substrate and hence 10-50% of the dye is unexhausted and remains in the dye bath as a waste [1]. These dyes are recalcitrant molecules, which are difficult to degrade biologically [2]. They are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic affecting human beings, fish species and microorganisms. Hence, their removal from wastewaters has become environmentally important [3]. Thus, the removal of dyes from colored effluent of textile industries is of major concern. Various techniques like chemical coagulation [4], electrolysis, chemical oxidation [5], photochemical degradation [6], membrane filtration [7], biological treatment, adsorption by activated carbon [8] are known to be effective for the removal of dyes from polluted water. Amongst, the numerous techniques available for dye removal, adsorption is the procedure of choice giving excellent results as it can be utilized for decolouration of dye effluents [9, 10]. Most commercial systems currently use activated carbon as a sorbent to remove dyes from effluents because of its excellent adsorption ability. However, although activated carbon is a preferred sorbent, its widespread use is restricted due to high cost. In order to decrease the cost of treatment, various attempts have been made to find inexpensive adsorbents. A sorbent can be considered low-cost if it requires little processing, being abundant in nature, a by-product or waste material generated from another industry [11]. Such alternatives include low cost activated carbons prepared from natural products like bagasse [12], nutshells [13], Jute fiber [14], rice husks [15], plum kernels [16] and coconut shells [17]. Activated carbons prepared from various products are widely used as adsorbents due to their high adsorption capacity, large surface area, microporous nature, chemical and thermal stability. In this article, an attempt has been made by Abstract Activated carbon of Prosopis juliflora Bark (PJBAC) is prepared using muffle furnace and employed for the removal of Direct Brown MR (DBMR) dye from aqueous solutions. Surface morphological studies carried out for unloaded and loaded carbons; indicate the surface changes in the porous nature of the dye loaded PJBAC. Batch equilibration experiments pertaining to the study of operating factors viz., varying initial dye concentrations, preset time intervals and different doses of PJBAC, variable pH and temperature environments are verified to assess the sorptive nature of PJBAC. Optimized conditions have been setup as 400 mg/L initial concentration; 60 min contact time; 100 mg dosage, pH 2 and 30 0 C temperature for a maximum of 90.2% dye removal with a sorption capacity of 180.4 mg/g. The isothermal plots for Langmuir, Freundlich and Tempkin equations are tested, wherein the best fit of linearity is observed for both Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms, suggesting monolayer/multilayer sorption. Thermodynamic parameters are calculated to study the nature of sorption, observed as endothermic, irreversible and spontaneous for DBMR-PJBAC system. Kinetic studies reveal the applicability of second order kinetic model."
273,10.2527/1999.7792428X,1999.0,Combined effect of epinephrine and exercise on calpain/calpastatin and cathepsin B and L activity in porcine longissimus muscle.,"The objective of the study was to improve the understanding of the relationship between the effect of epinephrine plus exercise and meat tenderness. The calpain, calpastatin, and cathepsin B + L activities and postmortem proteolysis in porcine longissimus muscle were studied. The muscle glycogen stores were depleted in five pigs by s.c. injection of epinephrine (.3 mg/kg) at 15 h antemortem and exercise on a treadmill (5 min, 3.8 km/h) immediately before slaughter. Antemortem injection of epinephrine and treadmill exercise resulted in higher ultimate pH (6.32 vs 5.66 in control) and decreased (P < .05) thaw loss, cooking loss, and shear force values. The muscle energy depletion treatment increased (P < .05) the muscle mu-calpain activity measured 42 min postmortem, and at 24 h mu-calpain activity was still approximately 50% greater in the high ultimate pH group. Also, as the ratio of mu-calpain to calpastatin increased (P < .01), the overall proteolytic potential of the calpain system were greater. These observations suggest that the muscle energy level may influence the activity of the calpain system in the living animal. The high ultimate pH group showed lower (P < .001) cathepsin B + L activity in the myofibrillar and the soluble fractions after 8 d of storage, suggesting that the increased ultimate pH increased the stability of the lysosomal membrane and thereby reduced the release of cathepsins from the lysosomes during storage. The SDS-PAGE showed increased (P < .001) degradation of a 39-kDa band in the epinephrine and exercise-treated samples. Degradation products at 30, 31, and 32 kDa were labeled by troponin-T antibody in western blot. An appearing 24-kDa band was identified as a troponin-I degradation product in western blot. The proteolytic degradation pattern of myofibrillar proteins during storage differed in control and treated samples, supporting the hypothesis that calpain-mediated proteolysis was affected after treatment, resulting in meat with high ultimate pH."
274,,2016.0,Abstract 19: Role of Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing of Alu Elements in Human Vascular Inflammatory Diseases,"Background: Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is catalysed by ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) and is an important posttranscriptional regulator of RNA metabolism. Although RNA editing is essential for life, its role in cardiovascular disease is unknown. Methods and Results: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of human endothelial cells revealed that ADAR1 is the main RNA editor in HUVECs. The vast majority of editing events are detected in Alu regions due to their ability to form double-stranded structures, a prerequisite for RNA editing. A-to-I RNA editing of the primate-specific Alu elements is observed in 25% of poly(A)+ transcripts and in 44% of ribosomal RNA-depleted transcripts. Cathepsin S (CTSS), an extracellular matrix degrading enzyme, has 3 Alu elements in its 3’-untranslated region and is among the most extensively edited mRNAs. Interestingly, ADAR1 silencing downregulates CTSS mRNA expression, whereas ADAR1 overexpression results in an increase of both CTSS RNA editing rate and CTSS mRNA expression. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), luciferase reporter and iCLIP assays showed that A-to-I RNA editing of the Alu elements in the 3’UTR of CTSS mRNA regulates the recruitment of the stabilizing RNA-binding protein HuR to CTSS 3’UTR and, thus, controls CTSS mRNA stability and expression. CTSS Alu RNA editing is increased under hypoxic or pro-inflammatory conditions in vitro , as well as in patients with coronary or carotid atherosclerotic vascular disease. Further, the extent of CTSS Alu RNA editing rate correlated with various markers of subclinical atherosclerosis including intima-media thickness and number of atherosclerotic plaques. Importantly, ADAR1 and the extent of CTSS RNA editing correlated with CTSS expression levels in patients’ samples from 6 non-overlapping cohorts of patients with inflammatory vascular diseases (total n=366), including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, carotid atherosclerotic plaques and thoracic aortic aneurysms. Conclusion: This study shows for the first time that Alu A-to-I RNA editing is a critical modulator of inflammatory gene expression in all stages of atherosclerotic vascular disease development."
275,10.1128/jvi.57.3.848-856.1986,1986.0,Biosynthesis of adenovirus type 2 i-leader protein,"The i-leader is a 440-base-pair sequence located between 21.8 and 23.0 map units on the adenovirus type 2 genome and is spliced between the second and third segments of the major tripartite leader in certain viral mRNA molecules. The i-leader contains an open translational reading frame for a hypothetical protein of Mr about 16,600, and a 16,000-Mr polypeptide (16K protein) has been translated in vitro on mRNA selected with DNA containing the i-leader (A. Virtanen, P. Aleström, H. Persson, M. G. Katze, and U. Pettersson, Nucleic Acids Res. 10:2539-2548, 1982). To determine whether the i-leader protein is synthesized during productive infection and to provide an immunological reagent to study the properties and functions of the i-leader protein, we prepared antipeptide antibodies directed to a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide which is encoded near the N terminus of the hypothetical i-leader protein and contains a high acidic amino acid and proline content. Antipeptide antibodies immunoprecipitated from extracts of adenovirus type 2-infected cells a major 16K protein that comigrated with a 16K protein translated in vitro. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis by Edman degradation of radiolabeled 16K antigen showed that methionine is present at residue 1 and leucine is present at residues 8 and 10, as predicted from the DNA sequence, establishing that the 16K protein precipitated by this antibody is indeed the i-leader protein. Thus, the i-leader protein is a prominent species that is synthesized during productive infection. The i-leader protein is often seen as a doublet on polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that either two related forms of i-leader protein are synthesized in infected cells or that a posttranslational modification occurs. Time course studies using immunoprecipitation analysis with antipeptide antibodies revealed that the E1A 289R T antigen and the E1B-19K (175R) T antigen are synthesized beginning at 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 h postinfection, respectively, whereas the i-leader protein is synthesized starting at about 8 h postinfection and continues unabated until at least 25 h postinfection. The i-leader protein is very stable, as determined by pulse-chase labeling experiments, and accumulates continuously from 8 to 25 h postinfection, as shown by immunoblot analysis. The synthesis of i-leader protein does not depend upon viral DNA replication. Thus, the i-leader protein is a viral gene product of unknown function and high stability that is made in large quantities at intermediate times of productive infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Polymers containing >96% 1,2-cyclopent-2-enylenvinylene units were obtained by low-temperature-initiated cyclopolymerization of diethyl dipropargylmalonate (DEDPM) by Mo(N-2,6-i-Pr2-C6H3)(CHCMe2Ph)(OCH(CH3)2)2. In the presence of quinuclidine, >96% 5-membered ring structures were realized at room temperature, e.g., using Mo(N-2,6- Me2-C6H3)(CHCMe2Ph)(OC(CH3)3)2. 4-(Ethoxycarbonyl)-4-(1S,2R,5S)-(+)-menthyl-1,6-heptadiyne was cyclopolymerized to determine the configuration of the double bond (i.e., the cis/trans ratio) and the tacticity of the poly(ene) backbone. Poly(4-(ethoxycarbonyl)-4-(1S,2R,5S)-(+)-menthyl-1,6- heptadiyne) again consisted of >96% 5-membered rings and possessed an all-trans tactic, presumably isotactic structure. A linear plot of number of monomers added (N) vs. molecular weight suggested that cyclopolymerization of DEDPM proceeded in a living manner. At least a class-V living system was confirmed by the stepwise synthesis of poly(DEDPM). Molecular weight distributions (PDIs) of 1.16-1.37 resulted from ratios of the rate constants for polymerization (kp) to initiation (k i), k p/k i >> 1. Influences of temperature, the base and steric and electronic effects of the arylimido and alkoxy ligand are presented. Complementary to the use of well-defined Schrock initiators, poly(DEDPM) containing exclusively 5-membered rings was accessible by the use of the quaternary systems MoCl5-n-Bu4Sn-EtOH-quinuclidine and MoOCl4-n-Bu4Sn-EtOH-quinuclidine. Though virtually identical polymers were obtained, the polymerization systems themselves were controlled, yet not living, as is the case with Schrock initiators. Selected polymer properties such as stability, degradation behavior, conductivity, and thermoresponsive behavior will be discussed. Finally, the polymerization behavior of other monomers such as N,N-dipropargylaniline (1), dipropargyl sulfide (2), 1,8-diethynylnaphthalene (3) and 1,2-diethynyltetramethyldisilane (4) is presented."
277,,2012.0,Interpenetrating polymer network of chitosan crosslinked silicone as medical implants,"Introduction Adherence of bacteria, named as bacterial colonisation on medical implant surface is the first step in the outbreak of implant-related infections. Bacterial colonisation has many different growth and survival strategy. One such type of colonisation is microbial biofilm formation, which is notably a risk full factor when takes place on the surface of inserted implants. These bacteria infect the patients by producing an extensive exopolysaccharide,‘glycocalyces’. Often in combination with derivatives from the host environment, the glycocalyces form a confluent protected biofilm on tissues and implanted materials.Rapidly dividing bacteria can spread along the surface of a device within the glycocalyx of the biofilm. Some of the surface bacteria can be shed and become free to attach to a new, non-colonised surface. For deriving nutrients and to counter cationic antimicrobial agents, an ion exchange matrix is formed within the biofilm. The biofilm structure also facilitates the interaction between different bacteria. The interaction of bacteria results in co-operative activities, like cross-feeding, and promoting genetic exchange and resistance transfer.Bacteria covered by biofilm can be more resistant to antimicrobial agents even at high concentration. This makes serious complications in treatment of implant related infections [1] . Catheter related infections are more frequent in postoperative stages of patients. Because of the size, shape and ambient environment, the biofilm formation is quite faster in implanted catheters both the outer and luminal wall of the device. A site specific active antimicrobial agent administered at high concentration can increase the success of antimicrobial chemotherapy Medical devices range from easily inserted and retrieved contact lenses, urinary catheters and endotracheal tubes to surgically implanted cardiac valves, hip joints and coronary stents [2] .Since silicone has been used successfully in many health care applications, it is tacitly understood that silicone materials are intrinsically biocompatible for preparing medical implants. Medical silicone materials, including fluids, gels, elastomers, and adhesives, are used extensively in medical field because it possess an appropriate host response at specific situations in patients. Silicone’s biodurability in medical applications is probably related to its exceptional thermal and chemical stability properties. Silicones remain essentially unaffected by repeated sterilization by autoclaving, and they can usually be dry heat sterilized as well. Silicones can also be formulated into other biomaterials, such as polyurethane, to enhance their biodurability [3] . Gaining resistance to antimicrobials is a major concern worldwide. Releasing antimicrobials at sub-inhibitory concentration to the surrounding tissues or fluids can induce resistance in infecting bacteria [4] . Both antibiotics and antiseptics are used to combat bacterial infections. However, bacterial resistance develops much less readily to antiseptics than to antibiotics [5] . Materials and Methods  Sample collection Urinary catheters made up of silicone are the chief research material of this study. These materials are collected from the Coimbatore Government Hospital, Coimbatore, India and coated with chitosan and a drug carrier, poly DL-lactic acid (PDLLA) using dip coating procedure [6] . Medical grade chitosan was AB STRACT Medical implants the most unavoidable medical device of nowadays has many potent advantages. One of the important limitations of it in medical usage is colonization of biofilm formers on the inner surface of the implants and produce high risk for the implantable material. This study involves the evaluation of one such high rate biofilm forming bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis which prevail in the blood. The research materials silicone used for making catheters and stents was coated with chitosan and crosslinked using polyD,L lactic acid (PDLLA) to provide anti-bacterial activity. This was achieved through a dip coating procedure. The bioefficacy against S. epidermidis, water absorbing ability, withstanding lysozyme degradation and biocompatibility analysis were done to understand whether the coated catheters can be more advantageous than the usual one used in hospitals normally. All the analysis showed more compatible result for the chitosan-PDLLA coated catheter samples. The bioefficacy effect of the dip coated catheters and its ability to eradicate the biofilm formation on the surface designated the modified silicone catheters as efficient implants."
278,,2012.0,N-INNER Final Scientific Report Project: Evaluation platform for polymer solar cells – Morphoso,"The objective of the project entitled “Morphoso” was to establish an evaluation platform for polymer solar cells in order to combine different approaches such as modeling, processing and characterization of devices with the aim to find both theoretical and experimental correlations between the thin film processes, the nanomorphology of the photoactive blend layer and the resulting generation, transport and recombination of charge carriers in organic solar cells. Synergies between the three project partners were used to achieve a better understanding of the fundamental processes taking place when operating an organic solar cell. Solar cells were built with different materials in all three labs and standard configurations were defined. To enhance absorption light trapping structures on the mmand the μm-scale were employed and their potential was determined. 3D-tomography was applied to visualize the morphology of the donor/acceptor network. Electrical modeling was performed with a continuum approach and a 2D heterojunction model was developed during the three years project time. Different experimental techniques like photoinduced absorption and CELIV (current extraction through linear increasing voltage) were used extensively to probe the generation and recombination of charge carriers as well as their transport through the photoactive layer. Last but not least the long term stability of different cell geometries was investigated and proper encapsulation materials and techniques were identified. In addition to these ageing experiments unsealed cells were exposed to oxygen or water vapor when illuminated in order to learn more about the specific degradation mechanisms. N-INNER final scientific report – Project: Evaluation platform for polymeric solar cells Morphoso IV Executive Summary Organic solar cells or organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a comparably young technology which attracted a lot of interest both from the scientific community and industry in the last years. This is on the one side due to the fact that it is relatively easy and cheap to start with research on organic solar cells as compared to their inorganic counterparts. On the other side, it is known since many years that this technology has one of the greatest potential for low costs among the next generation PV technologies. The reason is that organic solar cells can be processed at room temperature from solution with different printing techniques. High temperatures are not required which enables the use of flexible substrates (foils) and thus continuous processing with roll-to-roll technology becomes possible. Continuous roll-to-roll processing allows reaching very large throughput rates which translates directly into very low production costs. By intensive research the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells could be increased up to values of more than 9% using a nanoscale interpenetrating network of two materials, a donor and an acceptor. Although this new solar cell technology promises very low production costs there are still major tasks to be worked upon for providing solar electricity on a larger scale. For a technology breakthrough, the basic understanding of the fundamental processes in organic PV is necessary. This is anything but trivial to obtain due to the fact that the elementary processes take place on 120 nm scales within time frames from picoseconds to milliseconds. In addition, all this happens in disordered materials which are more difficult to describe on a quantitative manner than well-ordered, crystalline materials. The project “Morphoso” intended to make a contribution to the improvement in understanding the underlying processes which eventually determine the power output of solution-processed organic solar cells. The project consortium consisted of three partners from the three countries Sweden, Finland and Germany. The partners were a) The group “Biomolecular and Organic Electronics” led by Prof. Olle Inganäs at the Department of Physics at Linköping University in Sweden b) The group “Organic Electronics” from Prof. Ronald Österbacka at the Department of Physics and Centre for Functional Materials of the Åbo Akademi University (University of Turku) in Finland c) The group “Dye and organic Solar Cells” headed by Dr. Uli Würfel at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Freiburg, Germany The overall aim of the project consortium was to enhance the understanding of the physical processes taking place in solution-processed organic solar cells and contribute to the process of setting the basis for future improvements and thus pushing organic photovoltaics closer to real applications. We are all convinced that an enduring progress in this field can only be achieved when practical efforts and academic insights are combined in a proper way. Therefore we put the expertises of the three partners together and exchanged our – sometimes differing point of views in intensive scientific discussions. This was done either at one of the project meetings which took place regularly at one of the partners’ institutions or at international conferences where we met each other. The exchange of ideas among the researchers of our three-national project consortium was regarded as something extremely valuable by all people contributing to the project. Another aspect was that this way people got to know each other and set the basis for some shorter and longer stays in the group of one of the other consortium members. These visits allowed for more and prolonged discussions about the interpretation of experimental data and the most appropriate theoretical description of the underlying processes. In inorganic crystalline materials used as photoactive material for solar cells the absorption of a photon leads directly to the generation of free charge carriers, an electron and a hole. Although an electron and a hole are also created upon absorption of a photon in the photoactive layer of an organic solar cell they experience a strong binding energy in the range of ca. 0.5eV. This quasi-particle is called an exciton and as it is electrically neutral its transport is governed by diffusion. The thermal energy at temperatures around room temperature (or even at higher temperatures a solar cell would reach on a roof top, i.e. ≤ 85°C) is not enough to overcome this binding energy. Therefore a second component is present in the photoactive layer which offers a lower lying energy level for the electron which is called the acceptor. The exciton has to reach the interface between donor and acceptor within its lifetime. If this happens the electron is transferred from the donor to the acceptor on a picosecond-timescale with an efficiency approaching unity. This way free charge carriers are created and N-INNER final scientific report – Project: Evaluation platform for polymeric solar cells Morphoso V subsequently both charge carriers have to be transported to their respective contact, i.e. the holes in the donor phase and the electrons in the acceptor phase. In an organic solar cell the morphology of the photoactive layer is crucial for the performance of the device: if the two phases are very finely intermixed all excitons will reach an interface of donor and acceptor within their lifetime and the creation of free charge carriers is very efficient. On the other hand, the high interface area means that a charge carrier is always located very near to the other phase during its path toward the electrode. This leads to high(er) recombination which reduces especially the fill factor and thus the power output. On the other hand a coarse morphology will certainly improve the transport properties and thus reduce the recombination rate but will at the same time reduce the generation of free charge carriers because a certain fraction of the excitons will not be able to reach the donor/acceptor interface before they recombine. Of course the situation is far more complex and the morphology depends on layer thickness and process parameters like annealing, concentration and solvent. The aim of our efforts was to achieve a deeper understanding of the correlation between the morphological characteristics of the photoactive layer and its electro-optical properties which finally determine the device performance of an organic solar cell or module to a large extent. Our approach was to establish an evaluation platform that integrates device-modelling, -processing and characterisation to find the theoretical and experimental correlation between the thin film process, its nanomorphology and the generation and transport of charge carriers in the finished devices. In the beginning an inter-laboratory round robin study was performed and it confirmed that the measurements of the three project partners are well comparable."
279,,2011.0,O 2 . 2 Bacterial members of HtrA serine proteases family – important virulence factors and interesting models for structural studies,"The existence of a proteolytic system which can specifically recognize and cleave proteins in mitochondria is now well established. Components of this system comprise processing peptidases, ATP-dependent peptidases, and oligopeptidases. Processing peptidases mediate limited proteolysis while ATP-dependent proteases and oligopeptidases, working sequentially, are able to degrade proteins to amino acids.Three families of ATP-dependent proteases have been identified in plant mitochondria: Lon, Clp and FtsH. All members of these families have two domains, a homologous ATPase domain also termed AAA domain, with several conserved motifs including those necessary for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and a family specific proteolytic domain. FtsH proteases, also termed AAA peptidases or triple A peptidases, are ATP-dependent metalloproteases. They form high-molecular mass complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Recently, we demonstrated that their expression can be regulated at translational level. Generally, it is thought that triple A proteases control quality and quantity of membrane mitochondrial proteins and therefore they are important for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. The best characterized plant mitochondrial triple A protease is Arabidopsis FtsH4, whose catalytic site is exposed to the intermembrane space. Observations of Arabidopsis mutants lacking AtFtsH4 have revealed a pleiotropic phenotype including a germination delay, seedling establishment delay, alternation in leaf shape and inhibition of reproductive development. The germination delay was observed independently of conditions while the remaining phenotypic changes are conditional. We have proved the significance of the chaperone-like activity of AtFtsH4 for the assembly/stability of the oxidative phosphorylation system. We postulate that one of function of AtFtsH4 is to prevent accumulation of oxidized proteins under condition favorable for their accumulation as in ageing plants. Given the dual nature of FtsH as a protease and chaperone, AtFtsH4 can control the level of oxidized proteins by degrading them and/or decreasing the pool of unassembled subunits which undergo oxidation easily.

280,,2009.0,EMISSION LOAD OF HEXABROMOCYCLODODECANE IN JAPAN BASED ON THE SUBSTANCE FLOW ANALYSIS,"Atmospheric and aquatic emission load of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) for the period 1986-2030 were estimated by substance flow analysis. Through the investigation of quantitative HBCD life cycle, estimated HBCD stock in the use phase shows a continuous increase, indicating that emissions from the materials containing HBCD will be potentially long-term sources of pollutants leaching or volatizing to the environment. In Japan, 571 kg/year and 41 kg/year of HBCD was calculated to emit to the atmospheric and aquatic environment in 2000, respectively. This corresponds to 0.03 % of the consumed HBCD quantity in Japan. These environmental emissions of HBCD were increasing rapidly until 2011. On the other hand, decreasing trend for HBCD were estimated between 2012 and 2030 and the emissions were simulated to be as high as 225 kg/year in 2030. This is due to the scenario that the use of HBCD for textiles would be stopped. The largest component of the emissions is simulated to be into the atmosphere from the consumer product because the stock in the use phase has been growing over the whole period. The source profile of environmental emission would shift from upstream to downstream of product chain. The present study gives an insight to obtain basic information for long term measures toward strategic chemical management considering their life cycle Introduction Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) are important synthetic additives which are used to reduce the flammability of articles. Despite their benefits, however, the occurrence of BFRs in the environment as contaminants have recently an increasing attention because of the widespread use, high chemical stability and bioaccumulation potential of some BFRs. Among the BFRs, which are available commercially, HBCD has received more interest and has been conducted the risk assessment. Currently, increasing number of reports have shown the environmental distribution of HBCD in Europe , the U.S.A and Asia 4, . In current risk assessments, however, especially for the calculation of predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) in the environmental exposure assessment, the available dataset in Japan is usually limited. For reliable risk management, the need for identification of its sources and quantification of emissions are growing in importance. HBCD has been detected in various environmental compartments such as house dust, riverine sediment near the HBCD production plant and sewage sludge from municipal sewage treamtment plant . This implies that emissions of HBCD occur from private use and disposal of flame retarded products, as well as upon production and processing. Identification of emissions covering with the lifecycle (i.e., from production to disporsal) could be of concern for risk assessments. Thus, it is essential to gain knowledge about their behavior in both economic system and environmental system through the lifecycle for chemical substances. Currently, limited research work has focused on the intensive monitoring which is covered with the lifecycle of chemical substance. For the effective risk-reduction strategies of chemical pollutants, the methodology, which can estimate emissions and source of pollutants through their lifecycle, has been needed. Recently, substance flow analysis (SFA), which is used to describe or analyse the flow of one substance in, out and through a system, have been proposed as a useful tool to evaluate fate of substances quantitatively during all life stages. This includes the evaluation of sources, substance flows and pathways, stocks in private house-holds, industry and waste management. Traditionally, several researchers have employed SFA to support environmental management of heavy metals 9 from the view point of material recycling and resource recovery. On the other hand, only few studies to date have been performed for chemical substances. Recenty, Morf et alevaluated the source and environmental emission of some BFRs (Deca BDE and HBCD) through their lifecylce in Switzerland. However, environmental emission and lifecycle of target chemicals vary among countries or areas depending on the application of products and technologies. Vol. 71, 2009 / Organohalogen Compounds page 002471 In this study, we conducted dynamic (the time series) SFA of HBCD, which is one of the most important BFRs on the market in Japan under several scenarios to obtain basic information for long term measures toward strategic chemical management. The aim of this study was to identify possible emission pathways and determine the environmental occurrence of HBCD in Japan. Materials and Methods To estimate environmental emissions of HBCD from past to future during all life stages, the time series substance flow analysis (SFA), which consider the residence times of product, was applied in this study. For the procedure to establish the substance flow of HBCD, we determined the life cycle of HBCD with regard to space, function and time at first. As a next step, the environmental emission, the amount of flow and stock were quantified. The parameter functions for substance flow analysis were estimated based on broad literature data, multiple contacts with research groups, organizations, authorities and industry in Japan, our own analysis and assumptions. The life cycle of HBCD and Data. The system flow of HBCD in Japan is shown in Fig. 1.The spatial system boundary was defined as the border of Japan. The import of product containing HBCD (e.g., plastic and textile/furniture) and the export of waste have not been included in this study, due to the limitation of available data. Also, we have not considered about the flow after recycling process. In the industrial use stage, the use of HBCD was divided into polystyrene as insulation board and textile. During industrial use of polystyrene, some portion of insulation board was transferred to the use phase and the remaining was recycling. In order to take into account the difference of life time of consumer products during the private use process, the use of insulation board was divided into four applications as end-product (i.e., office building, reinforced concrete house, wooden residential house and tatami mat). On the other hand, the use of textile was divided into interior textile and automobile interior textile. During life time of these consumer products, we have not considered about the degradation loss of HBCD. Finally, the consumer product is distributed after its residence time in the use phase to the waste (landfill or incineration) or recycling processes. In Japan, the product containing HBCD has been disposed to stable type landfill. Therefore, we assume the products are stabilized after one year and release no HBCD. Also, we have considered about the waste containing HBCD, which is generated at each life cycle step (i.e., pre-consumer waste). In this system, the time span was set up 1986-2030 and the time unit was one year. Based on the life cycle of HBCD, the quantitative data concerning to emissions, flow and stock were gathered as a next step. In each stage, the amount of environmental emission and transfer were calculated by multiplying the input to each sage and emission factor and/or transfer coefficient. The input to a stage corresponds to the amount of transfer from the previous stage. The initial input of HBCD to the system corresponds to the amount of domestic demand, whereas the import HB CD is directly added to the industrial use stage. Emission factors during all the life stages were evaluated or estimated according to EU Risk assessment report of HBCD. To confirm the reliability of factors and whether emission factors from EU can be applied into those of Japan, we have interviewed to the relevant company and committee. Emission factor are defined as constant value from past to future (i.e., 1986-2030), although environmental emission depend heavily on new production and waste management techniques. Transfer coefficients were also defined as constant value. The data were gathered from available literature. These values, in particular management strategies, could be time-dependent. However, due to the limitation of available data, they were defined as constant value through the time period in this study. For the consumption (sum of the amount of domestic demand and import) and application patterns (four application of insulation board and two for textile) of HBCD, the estimated consumption data of HBCD are available from 1986 to 2001in Japan. Based on this data from 1986 to 2001, we extrapolated the consumption to 2030. For this prediction of HBCD consumption, the textile industry association demonstrates that the use of HBCD will be banned until 2013, whereas the use of HBCD for polystyrene as insulation board will be increased. Therefore, this study was incorporated in that scenario. For application patterns, based on the available literature data on relevant industry from 1986 to 2006, we extrapolated the application patterns to 2030. Among application pattern in HBCD, polystyrene as insulation board make up by far the most important component of HBCD consumption (80% in the present year). The application areas, textiles/furniture (20% each) is less important.

The presence of Sn(II), Sb(III), or Fe(II) low valent state species was not detected in the samples. Resistivity vs temperature measurements revealed a semiconducting behavior from room temperature up to 900 °C with about four orders in magnitude decrease of the resistivity.
