0,10.1039/d3ra05647c,2023.0,A polymer donor based on difluoro-quinoxaline with a naphthalimide substituent unit exhibits a low-lying HOMO level for efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells,"The design and synthesis of polymer donors with a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level are crucial for increasing open-circuit voltages (VOC) and achieving high-performance non-fullerene polymer solar cells. Here, we developed two copolymers using non-fluorinated or fluorinated thienyl-conjugated benzodithiophenes as electron donor units, and difluoro-quinoxaline with a naphthalimide substituent (DNB) as the electron acceptor unit. These copolymers, namely PDNB and PDNB-2F, exhibited deep HOMO levels owing to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the naphthalimide substituent. Density-functional theory calculations demonstrated that the skeletons of the two copolymers featured good coplanarity. Owing to the fluorination, PDNB-2F displayed an increased absorption coefficient and deeper HOMO level than PDNB. Moreover, the blended film based on PDNB-2F:Y6 demonstrated enhanced carrier mobility, decreased bimolecular recombination as well as favorable phase-separation regions. Consequently, the PDNB-2F:Y6-based device yielded a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.18%, whereas the device based on PDNB:Y6 showed a comparatively lower PCE of 8.83%. These results indicate that difluoro-quinoxaline with a naphthalimide substituent is a prospective electron-deficient building block to develop donor polymers with low-lying HOMO levels to achieve efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells."

The physical, optical, and electrochemical properties of PBDT-TFMTh were studied in detail and it was found to have lower-lying highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. The polymer solar cell with an active layer consisting of PBDT-TFMTh and acceptor IDT(TCV)2 showed a relatively high power conversion efficiency of 2.25% after thermal annealing at 120 °C."
2,10.1039/C7TA01143A,2017.0,"Design, synthesis, and structural characterization of the first dithienocyclopentacarbazole-based n-type organic semiconductor and its application in non-fullerene polymer solar cells","Ladder-type dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) cores, which possess highly extended π-conjugated backbones and versatile modular structures for derivatization, were widely used to develop high-performance p-type polymeric semiconductors. However, an n-type DTCC-based organic semiconductor has not been reported to date. In this study, the first DTCC-based n-type organic semiconductor (DTCC–IC) with a well-defined A–D–A backbone was designed, synthesized, and characterized, in which a DTCC derivative substituted by four p-octyloxyphenyl groups was used as the electron-donating core and two strongly electron-withdrawing 3-(dicyanomethylene)indan-1-one moieties were used as the terminal acceptors. It was found that DTCC–IC has strong light-capturing ability in the range of 500–720 nm and exhibits an impressively high molar absorption coefficient of 2.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 669 nm owing to effective intramolecular charge transfer and a strong D–A effect. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTCC–IC are −5.50 and −3.87 eV, respectively. More importantly, a high electron mobility of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was determined by the space-charge-limited current method; this electron mobility can be comparable to that of fullerene derivative acceptors (μe ∼ 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). To investigate its application potential in non-fullerene solar cells, we fabricated organic solar cells (OSCs) by blending a DTCC–IC acceptor with a PTB7-Th donor under various conditions. The results suggest that the optimized device exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6% and a rational high VOC of 0.95 V. These findings demonstrate that the ladder-type DTCC core is a promising building block for the development of high-mobility n-type organic semiconductors for OSCs."
3,10.1002/chem.202301337,2023.0,"Silicon‐ and Germanium‐Functionalized Perylene Diimides: Synthesis, Optoelectronic Properties, and Their Application as Non‐fullerene Acceptors in Organic Solar Cells","Abstract Organic solar cells have been continuously studied and developed through the last decades. A major step in their development was the introduction of fused‐ring non‐fullerene electron acceptors. Yet, beside their high efficiency, they suffer from complex synthesis and stability issues. Perylene‐based non‐fullerene acceptors, in contrast, can be prepared in only a few steps and display good photochemical and thermal stability. Herein, we introduce four monomeric perylene diimide acceptors obtained in a three‐step synthesis. In these molecules, the semimetals silicon and germanium were added in the bay position, on one or both sides of the molecules, resulting in asymmetric and symmetric compounds with a red‐shifted absorption compared to unsubstituted perylene diimide. Introducing two germanium atoms improved the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in the blend with the conjugated polymer PM6. In addition, charge carrier separation is significantly influenced by the high crystallinity of this blend, as shown by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 5.38 %, which is one of the highest efficiencies of monomeric perylene diimide‐based solar cells recorded to date."
4,10.1002/chem.202300653,2023.0,Anthradithiophene (ADT)-Based Polymerized Non-Fullerene Acceptors for All-Polymer Solar Cells.,"Realizing efficient all-polymer solar cell (APSC) acceptors typically involves increased building block synthetic complexity, hence potentially unscalable syntheses and/or prohibitive costs. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and implementation in APSCs of three new polymer acceptors P1-P3 using a scalable donor fragment, bis(2-octyldodecyl)anthra[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene-4,10-dicarboxylate (ADT) co-polymerized with the high-efficiency acceptor units, NDI, Y6, and IDIC. All three copolymers have comparable photophysics to known polymers, however APSCs fabricated by blending P1, P2 and P3 with donor polymers PM5 and PM6 exhibit modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the champion P2-based APSC achieving PCE = 5.64%. Detailed morphological and microstructural analysis by AFM and GIWAXS reveal a non-optimal APSC active layer morphology which suppresses charge transport. Despite the modest efficiencies, these APSCs demonstrate the feasibility of using ADT as a scalable and inexpensive electron rich/donor building block for APSCs."
5,10.1039/d0tc00435a,2020.0,Design and synthesis of an amino-functionalized non-fullerene acceptor as a cathode interfacial layer for polymer solar cells,"A novel n-type organic small-molecule semiconductor, denoted N-IDTBR, was designed and synthesized by introducing an amine group into the extensively used non-fullerene acceptor O-IDTBR. This new material can be readily dissolved in alcohol, which allowed it to be spin-cast on top of a photoactive layer by processing with an orthogonal solvent for the construction of multilayer polymer solar cells. A poly(3-hexylthiophene):O-IDTBR blend was selected as a model system, which contains N-IDTBR as the cathode interlayer. We adopted non-halogenated anisole/2-methylanisole as the processing solvent to fabricate the active layer and achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 6.1%. Of particular interest is the fact that the N-IDTBR functioned not only as a single cathode interfacial layer to facilitate charge collection, but it also presented slight contribution to the light-harvesting capability of the device, thus leading to enhanced current density of the resulting devices. More importantly, the PCEs of the devices remained at 5.85 ± 0.25% as the thickness of the N-IDTBR layer varied from 5 to 30 nm, which demonstrated their great potential for future practical applications."
6,10.1021/jacs.6b01744,2016.0,Non-Fullerene Polymer Solar Cells Based on Alkylthio and Fluorine Substituted 2D-Conjugated Polymers Reach 9.5% Efficiency.,"Non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) with solution-processable n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as acceptor have seen rapid progress recently owing to the synthesis of new low bandgap n-OS, such as ITIC. To further increase power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices, it is of a great challenge to develop suitable polymer donor material that matches well with the low bandgap n-OS acceptors thus providing complementary absorption and nanoscaled blend morphology, as well as suppressed recombination and minimized energy loss. To address this challenge, we synthesized three medium bandgap 2D-conjugated bithienyl-benzodithiophene-alt-fluorobenzotriazole copolymers J52, J60, and J61 for the application as donor in the PSCs with low bandgap n-OS ITIC as acceptor. The three polymers were designed with branched alkyl (J52), branched alkylthio (J60), and linear alkylthio (J61) substituent on the thiophene conjugated side chain of the benzodithiophene (BDT) units for studying effect of the substituents on the photovoltaic performance of the polymers. The alkylthio side chain, red-shifted absorption down-shifted the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and improved crystallinity of the 2D conjugated polymers. With linear alkylthio side chain, the tailored polymer J61 exhibits an enhanced JSC of 17.43 mA/cm(2), a high VOC of 0.89 V, and a PCE of 9.53% in the best non-fullerene PSCs with the polymer as donor and ITIC as acceptor. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 9.53% is one of the highest values reported in literature to date for the non-fullerene PSCs. The results indicate that J61 is a promising medium bandgap polymer donor in non-fullerene PSCs."
7,10.3390/molecules27196522,2022.0,Fullerene-Perylenediimide (C60-PDI) Based Systems: An Overview and Synthesis of a Versatile Platform for Their Anchor Engineering,"An overview of the different covalent bonding synthetic strategies of two electron acceptors leading to fullerene-perylenediimide (C60-PDI)-based systems, essentially dyads and triads, is presented, as well as their more important applications. To go further in the development of such electron and photoactive assemblies, an original aromatic platform 5-benzyloxy-3-formylbenzoic acid was synthesized to graft both the PDI dye and the fullerene C60. This new C60-PDI dyad exhibits a free anchoring phenolic function that could be used to attach a third electro- and photoactive unit to study cascade electron and/or energy transfer processes or to obtain unprecedented side-chain polymers in which the C60-PDI dyads are attached as pendant moieties onto the main polymer chain. This C60-PDI dyad was fully characterized, and cyclic voltammetry showed the concomitant reduction process onto both C60 and PDI moieties at identical potential. A quasi-quantitative quenching of fluorescence was demonstrated in this C60-PDI dyad, and an intramolecular energy transfer was suggested between these two units. After deprotection of the benzyloxy group, the free hydroxyl functional group of the platform was used as an anchor to reach a new side-chain methyl methacrylate-based polymer in which the PDI-C60 dyad units are located as pendants of the main polymer chain. Such polymer which associates two complementary acceptors could find interesting applications in optoelectronics and in particular in organic solar cells."
8,10.1021/ACS.CHEMMATER.8B01491,2018.0,A Rational Design and Synthesis of Cross-Conjugated Small Molecule Acceptors Approaching High-Performance Fullerene-Free Polymer Solar Cells,"Considering the combination of the advantages of both the acceptor–donor–acceptor and perylene diimide type acceptors, three new cross-conjugated small molecule non-fullerene acceptors were rationally designed and synthesized. Their thermal, optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were systematically investigated. These acceptors exhibit highly extended absorption spectra ranging from 300 to 700 nm as well as appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels compared with those of the general acceptors based on perylene diimide. Non-fullerene polymer solar cells based on the resultant acceptors were fabricated in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:acceptor/PFN-Br/Ag configuration. Benefiting from efficient exciton dissociation, reduced bimolecular recombination, and enhanced and balanced electron mobility, the device-based PDIBDT-IT exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.06% with a high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 13.60 mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 60.45%, and an open-cir..."
9,10.1021/acsaem.9b01532,2019.0,Backbone Fluorination of Polythiophenes Improves Device Performance of Non-Fullerene Polymer Solar Cells,"Polythiophenes (PTs) are promising donor materials for the industrialization of polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to the merits of easy synthesis, low cost, and large-scale producibility. The rapid progress of non-fullerene acceptors requires the development of new PTs for use in non-fullerene PSCs. In this work, we present a set of PTs with different degrees of backbone fluorination (P6T-F00, P6T-F50, P6T-F75, and P6T-F100) to investigate the effect of fluorination on the photovoltaic properties of PTs in non-fullerene PSCs. Upon increasing fluorine content, the PTs tend to have higher crystallinity, higher absorption coefficients, and enhanced relative dielectric constants. When blended with a non-fullerene acceptor EH-IDTBR, the blend films show increased photoluminescence quenching efficiency, reduced charge recombination loss, and extended charge carrier lifetime along with increasing fluorine content of PTs. These positive factors collectively result in dramatically improved power conversion efficiency..."
10,10.1002/adfm.202106924,2021.0,Self‐Assembled Fullerene Nanostructures: Synthesis and Applications,"Functionalized fullerene nanostructures are a distinct class of materials that exhibit the combined properties of both fullerene and nanostructures including excellent optoelectronic features, modified band edges, high electron affinity, fast charge transfer capabilities, and tunable structural and textural properties. These fascinating properties allow for their utilization in many applications such as polymer solar cells, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, photodynamic therapy, electrocatalysis, environmental remediation, and drug and gene delivery. Numerous synthesis methods and anchoring groups are employed for functionalized fullerenes with nanostructures by using convergent bottom‐up and top‐down strategies. The supramolecular self‐assembly and functionalization of fullerenes through robust chemistry approaches such as surface oxidation, grafting, polymer coating, doping of metals/nonmetal heteroatoms, noncovalent modification with 2D materials and nanoparticle attachment result in achieving fine control over its surface and bulk properties, including increased solubility, wettability, electron transport, acid–base properties, adsorption, electronic conductivity, and light absorption. This review analyzes the salient developments in the fabrication of nanostructured fullerenes and their functionalized derivatives for many applications including adsorption, catalysis, sensors, energy storage, solar cells, drug delivery, magnetic and superconducting devices. The contents of this review will allow the readers to cherish exciting possibilities and opportunities in field of functionalized nanofullerenes."
11,10.1039/c9ra02670c,2019.0,On the homocoupling of trialkylstannyl monomers in the synthesis of diketopyrrolopyrrole polymers and its effect on the performance of polymer-fullerene photovoltaic cells,"Homocoupling of monomers in a palladium-catalyzed copolymerization of donor–acceptor polymers affects the perfect alternating structure and may deteriorate the performance of such materials in solar cells. Here we investigate the effect of homocoupling bis(trialkylstannyl)-thiophene and -bithiophene monomers in two low band gap poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-oligothiophene) polymers by deliberately introducing extended oligothiophene defects in a controlled fashion. We find that extension of the oligothiophene by one or two thiophenes and creating defects up to at least 10% does not significantly affect the opto-electronic properties of the polymers or their photovoltaic performance as electron donor in solar cells in combination with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butytic acid methyl ester as acceptor. By using model reactions, we further demonstrate that for the optimized synthetic protocol and palladium-catalyst system the naturally occurring defect concentration in the polymers is expected to be less than 0.5%."
12,10.1021/jacs.0c13326,2021.0,Helically Organized Fullerene Array in a Supramolecular Polymer Main Chain.,"To date, supramolecular chemistry techniques have been applied to fullerene polymer synthesis, enabling the development of main-chain fullerene polymers whose primary structure is well regulated, including linear, dendritic, and net-like fullerene arrays. These research achievements have led to an intriguing scientific challenge to create main-chain fullerene polymers with higher structural regulation. Here, we report the fabrication of a helically organized fullerene array based on the supramolecular polymerization of chiral ditopic tetrakiscalix[5]arene hosts and a dumbbell-shaped fullerene. The molecular association between the chiral hosts and the dumbbell-shaped fullerene resulted in sizable supramolecular polymers in solution, with the highest degree of polymerization of more than 32. The achiral dumbbell-shaped fullerene exhibited circular dichroism in the π-π* transition bands arising from the fullerene moieties through supramolecular polymerization. End-capping experiments of the supramolecular helical polymers showed that the chirally twisted conformation of the dumbbell-shaped fullerene was directed by supramolecular polymerization. Finally, the helical morphology of the supramolecular polymer chain was visualized by atomic force microscopy. The successful development of helical main-chain fullerene polymers would break new ground in fullerene chemistry."
13,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201803261,2019.0,Non-Fullerene Polymer Solar Cells Based on a New Polythiophene Derivative as Donor,": With the development of non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors, non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) have garnered increased attention due to their high performance. While photons are absorbed and converted to free charge carriers in the active layer, the donor and acceptor materials both play a critical role in determining the performance of PSCs. Among the various conjugated-polymer donor materials, polythiophene (PT) derivatives such as poly(3-hexylthiophene), have attracted considerable interest due to their high hole mobility and simple synthesis. However, there are limited studies on the applications of PT derivatives in non-fullerene PSCs. Fabrication of highly efficient non-fullerene PSCs utilizing PT derivatives as the donor is a challenging topic. In this study, a new PT derivative, poly[5,5 ′ -4,4 ′ -bis(2-butyloctylsulphanyl)-2,2 ′ -bithiophene-alt-5,5 ′ -4,4 ′ -difluoro-2,2 ′ -bithiophene] (PBSBT-2F), with alkylthio groups and fluorination was synthesized for use as the donor in non-fullerene PSC applications. The absorption spectra, electrochemical properties, molecular packing, and photovoltaic properties of PBSBT-2F were investigated and compared with those of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The polymer exhibited a wide bandgap of 1.82 eV, a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of − 5.02 eV, and an ordered molecular packing structure. Following this observation, PSCs based on a blend of PBSBT-2F as the donor and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno-[2,3- d :2 ′ ,3 ′ - d ′ ]- s -indaceno[1,2- b :5,6- b ′ ]dithiophene (ITIC) as the acceptor were fabricated. The absorption spectra were collected and the energy levels were found to be well matched. These devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.7% with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 0.75 V, a short-circuit current density ( J SC ) of 13.5 mA·cm -2 , and a fill factor (FF) of 66.6%. These properties were superior to those of P3HT (1.2%) under the optimal conditions. This result indicates that PBSBT-2F is a promising donor material for non-fullerene PSCs."
14,10.1021/acsami.5b04351,2015.0,Synthesis and Isolation of cis-2 Regiospecific Ethylene-Tethered Indene Dimer-[70]Fullerene Adduct for Polymer Solar Cell Applications.,"Although the utilization of [70]fullerene bis-adducts can enhance the power conversion efficiencies of polymer solar cells (PSCs) owing to their strong absorption intensities and high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, this synthetic strategy typically yields a mixture of regioisomers that would mask the intrinsic device performances depending on the substituent pattern on the [70]fullerene derivatives. In this study, a single cis-2 regioisomer of C70 bis-adduct (cis-2-[70]BIEC) has been prepared for the first time by the same strategy that had been applied to [60]fullerene to obtain a regioisomerically pure C60 bis-adduct (cis-2-[60]BIEC). Diels-Alder reaction was conducted between a rationally designed ethylene-tethered indene dimer and [70]fullerene, followed by isolation using high-performance liquid chromatography suitable for the separation of fullerene derivatives. A series of structural analysis techniques including NMR spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography were used to identify the absolute configuration of the bis-adduct. A systematic study on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of cis-2-[70]BIEC as well as the corresponding regioisomer mixture (bis-[70]BIEC) and the monoadduct (α-mono-[70]BIEC) has been performed to examine the effect of the pure cis-2 regioisomer. More importantly, their properties are compared with those of cis-2-[60]BIEC to address the effect of fullerene cage structures, that is, C60 versus C70. The PSC based on cis-2-[70]BIEC and poly(3-hexylthiophene) showed a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 4.2%, which is higher than those with bis-[70]BIEC (2.2%), α-mono-[70]BIEC (2.2%), cis-2-[60]BIEC (2.8%), and even a prevalent high-performance C70 monoadduct ([70]PCBM, 3.8%). Our synthetic strategy will pave the way for further development on the rational design and isolation of single fullerene bis-adduct regioisomers exhibiting high device performances."
15,10.1002/cjoc.202300765,2024.0,Recent Advances of Imide‐Functionalized Polymer Donors for Non‐fullerene Solar Cells†,"In recent years, there has been a shift towards using non‐fullerene electron acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs) as a replacement for fullerene derivatives. This change requires polymer donors that possess compatible physical properties, such as absorption range, HOMO energy level, miscibility, and crystallinity. Moreover, the high cost and poor batch‐to‐batch reproducibility of polymer donors also hinder future large‐scale manufacturing. These emphasize the need to explore alternative types of polymer donors. The imide‐functionalized building units possess several key attributes that make their polymers highly promising for non‐fullerene OSCs. These attributes include ease of synthesis, strong electron‐withdrawing ability, rigid and co‐planar structure, and the ability to easily tune solubility through imide side chains. In this review, we summarized the synthetic routes of imide building units, and the structural evolution of imide‐functionalized polymer donors by focusing on the effects of polymer structure on their physical, optoelectronic, and photovoltaic properties. We hope that this mini‐review will serve as a catalyst for future research on imide‐functionalized polymers toward high‐performance, cost‐effective, and durable organic solar cells (OSCs).

16,10.3390/POLYM7050896,2015.0,Synthesis and Characterization of [60]Fullerene-Glycidyl Azide Polymer and Its Thermal Decomposition,"A new functionalized [60]fullerene-glycidyl azide polymer (C60-GAP) was synthesized for the first time using a modified Bingel reaction of [60]fullerene (C60) and bromomalonic acid glycidyl azide polymer ester (BM-GAP). The product was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) analyses. Results confirmed the successful preparation of C60-GAP. Moreover, the thermal decomposition of C60-GAP was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis coupled with infrared spectroscopy (TGA-IR), and in situ FTIR. C60-GAP decomposition showed a three-step thermal process. The first step was due to the reaction of the azide group and fullerene at approximately 150 °C. The second step was ascribed to the remainder decomposition of the GAP main chain and N-heterocyclic at approximately 240 °C. The final step was attributed to the burning decomposition of amorphous carbon and carbon cage at around 600 °C."
17,10.1002/pssb.201200084,2012.0,Easy synthesis of Pd fullerene polymer structures from the molten state of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0),"Pd fullerene composites were first synthesized and studied in the early 90s by for example Nagashima et al. In this study we present a novel and rapid approach to synthesize Pd fullerides based on direct reaction of C60 with Pd2dba3. We show that the Pd fullerene polymer phase forms at temperatures around the melting point of Pd2dba3 (150 °C) and that it proceeds upon further annealing while releasing dba. The synthesis reactions were studied in TGA/DSC. TEM revealed that the material easily collapses under the electron beam into nanoparticles. Under very low doses almost no particles can be found. Similarly, Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of Pd fulleride polymers but also supported the collapse of the Pd fulleride phase when irradiated by high laser power. CVD experiments have been conducted on directly coated Si substrates showing similar results to previous reports, namely that Pd2C60 is an efficient catalysts for the growth of helical carbon nanofibers. Our study gives both insights into the formation of nanoparticles as well as the synthesis of C60 polymers. The method is also compatible with direct coating processes making it useful for a broad spectrum of CVD and catalysis applications."
18,10.1002/adom.202001836,2020.0,Design and Synthesis of a New Non‐Fullerene Acceptor for High‐Performance Photomultiplication‐Type Organic Photodiodes,"Photomultiplication‐type organic photodiodes (PM‐OPDs) rely on acceptor molecules for both charge separation and efficient gain generation. Herein, a new non‐fullerene acceptor is designed and synthesized by introducing thienylenevinylene (TV) groups into the conventional 2,2ʹ‐[[6,6,12,12‐tetrakis(4‐hexylphenyl)‐6,12‐dihydrodithieno[2,3‐d:2ʹ,3ʹ‐dʹ]‐s‐indaceno[1,2‐b:5,6‐bʹ]dithiophene‐2,8‐diyl]bis[methylidyne(3‐oxo‐1H‐indene‐2,1(3H)‐diylidene)]]bis[propanedinitrile] (ITIC) structure. The resulting TV‐ITIC acceptor possesses not only extended π‐conjugation length, which leads to lower energy bandgap as well as deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, but also enhanced hydrophobic characteristics, owing to the increased volumetric portion of the aliphatic chain, which improves the miscibility with the donor polymer semiconductor, poly(3‐hexylthiophene‐2,5‐diyl) (P3HT). Moreover, pristine TV‐ITIC films consist of intrinsically well‐ordered anisotropic crystallites, which are confirmed by 2D grazing incidence X‐ray diffraction (2D‐GIXD) analysis. All of these photophysical properties are beneficial for efficient exciton separation, electron trapping, and charge injection abilities of PM‐OPDs compared to those obtained with conventional ITIC. Because of such synergetic contributions of TV‐ITIC to the photomultiplication mechanism, the resulting optimized PM‐OPD exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (>74,000%) and a large specific detectivity (>1012 Jones)."

The best PSFu was selected on the basis of solubility and band gap energy for application studies. Feasibility for using PSFu as a replacement of C60 in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells was explored. Performance of the BHJ cells containing PSFu was comparable to that of the cells containing neat C60, irrespective of the acceptor/donor weight ratios, even the actual amount of C60 in PSFu molecules was (about 5 times) lower than that of the neat C60."
20,10.1002/cplu.202000354,2020.0,A Cross-Linkable Electron-Transport Layer Based on a Fullerene-Benzoxazine Derivative for Inverted Polymer Solar Cells.,"The synthesis, optoelectronic characterization and device properties of a cross-linkable fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61 -butyric benzoxazine ester (PCBB) is reported. PCBB shows all the basic photophysical and electrochemical properties of the parent compound [6,6]-phenyl-C61 -butyric methyl ester (PCBM). Thermal cross-linking of the benzoxazine moiety in PCBB resulted in the formation of cross-linked, solvent resistive adhesive films (C-PCBB). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopic studies showed dramatic reduction in the roughness and aggregation behaviour of P3HT-PCBM polymer blend film upon incorporation of C-PCBB interlayer. An inverted bulk heterojunction solar cell based on the configuration ITO/ZnO/C-PCBB/P3HT-PCBM/V2 O5 /Ag achieved 4.27 % power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the reference device ITO/ZnO/P3HT-PCBM/V2 O5 /Ag (PCE=3.28 %). This 25 % increase in the efficiency is due to the positive effects of C-PCBB on P3HT/C-PCBB and PCBM/C-PCBB heterojunctions."
21,10.1117/12.2568519,2020.0,Triplet exciton losses in polymer: fullerene-free acceptor blends,"In the past, most organic solar cells (OSCs) employed fullerenes as electron acceptors. Recently, the synthesis of novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) resulted in high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 18.2%. The remarkably high VOC in NFA-based OSCs has been achieved by increasing charge transfer energy (CT) via closer matching of acceptor (A) and donor (D) energy levels. Moreover, an increase in CT energy can lead to a new loss pathway resulting from charge recombination to the now energetically favorable D and A triplet exciton (TE) states. Formation of TEs is not only causing a new loss pathway and reduced short-circuit current but can also lead to enhanced degradation of the active layer. We studied the polymer donor PBDB-T and its fluorinated version PM6, and the thiophene-based acceptor molecule ITIC and a novel benzothiadiazole-based acceptor molecule Y6. With low temperature spin-sensitive photoluminescence measurements formation of TEs is studied."

The synthesis of well-defined fullerene-containing polymers, having double polymeric chains attached to fullerene in a regioselective manner, is a fundamental challenge in both synthetic organic chemistry and precision polymer chemistry. Here, inspired by the state-of-the-art fullerene chemistry, we present a new strategy for the stepwise synthesis of double-armed polymers with fullerene C60 at the junction in high reaction yields and with high selectivity. First, poly(styrene)-attached 1,2-hydrofullerene (1,2-PS-C60-H) was synthesized via the cobalt-catalyzed radical addition reaction. Next, the fullerenyl anion, 1,2-PS-C60−, was reacted with bromo-terminated poly(acetoxystyrene) to generate diblock copolymer 1,4-bisadducts (1,4-PS-C60-PAS). This example highlights the applicability of polymeric 1,4-fullerene bisadducts for self-assembling building blocks and potential organic electronics."

High‐efficiency polymer donors have been tested with these non‐fullerene acceptors in order to further boost the efficiency of organic solar cells. Most of the polymer:fullerene systems are optimized with solvent additives for high efficiency, while little attention has been paid to NFA‐based solar cells so far. In this report, the effect of the most common additive, 1,8‐diiodooctane (DIO), on PTB7‐Th:PC71BM solar cells is investigated and it is compared with non‐fullerene acceptor 3,9‐bis(2‐methylene‐(3‐(1,1‐dicyanomethylene)‐indanone))‐5,5,11,11‐tetrakis(4‐hexylphenyl)‐dithieno[2,3‐d:2′,3′‐d′]‐s‐indaceno‐[1,2‐b:5,6b′]di‐thiophene (ITIC) devices. It is interesting that the high boiling solvent additive does have a negative impact on the power conversion efficiency when PTB7‐Th is blended with ITIC acceptor. The solar cell devices are studied in terms of their optical, photophysical, and morphological properties and find out that PTB7‐Th:ITIC devices with DIO results in coarser domains, reduced absorption strength, and slightly lower mobility, while DIO improves the absorption strength of the PTB7‐Th:PC71BM blend film and increase the aggregation of PC71BM in the blend, resulting in higher fill factor and Jsc."

In this work, we demonstrate a novel, robot-based, high-throughput procedure performing automatic poly(3-hexylthio-phene-2,5-diyl) and indene-C60 bisadduct nanoparticle ink synthesis in nontoxic alcohols. A novel methodology to prepare particle dispersions for fully functional OPVs by manipulating the particle size and solvent system was studied in detail. The ethanol dispersion with a particle diameter of around 80-100 nm exhibits reduced degradation, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 4.52%, which is the highest performance reported so far for water/alcohol-processed OPV devices. By successfully deploying the high-throughput robot-based approach for an organic nanoparticle ink preparation, we believe that the findings demonstrated in this work will trigger more research interest and effort on eco-friendly industrial production of OPVs."

31,10.1021/acsami.7b05417,2017.0,Push-Pull Type Non-Fullerene Acceptors for Polymer Solar Cells: Effect of the Donor Core.,"There has been a growing interest in the design and synthesis of non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells that may overcome the drawbacks of the traditional fullerene-based acceptors. Herein, two novel push-pull (acceptor-donor-acceptor) type small-molecule acceptors, that is, ITDI and CDTDI, with indenothiophene and cyclopentadithiophene as the core units and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) as the end-capping units, are designed and synthesized for non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). After device optimization, PSCs based on ITDI exhibit good device performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 8.00%, outperforming the CDTDI-based counterparts fabricated under identical condition (2.75% PCE). We further discuss the performance of these non-fullerene PSCs by correlating the energy level and carrier mobility with the core of non-fullerene acceptors. These results demonstrate that indenothiophene is a promising electron-donating core for high-performance non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors."
32,10.1021/acsami.6b15717,2017.0,Efficient Polymer Solar Cells with High Open-Circuit Voltage Containing Diketopyrrolopyrrole-Based Non-Fullerene Acceptor Core End-Capped with Rhodanine Units.,"Herein we report the synthesis of a novel A-D-A-D-A non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor (NFSMA) bearing a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor central core coupled to terminal rhodanine acceptors via a thiophene donor linker (denoted as MPU1) for use in non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). This NFSMA exhibits a narrow optical band gap (1.48 eV), strong absorption in the 600-800 nm wavelength region of the solar spectrum, and a lowest unoccupied energy level of -3.99 eV. When the mixture of a medium band gap D-A copolymer P (1.75 eV) was used as donor and MPU1 as acceptor, the blend film showed a broad absorption profile from 400 to 850 nm, beneficial for light harvesting efficiency of the resulted polymer solar cell. After optimization of the donor-to-acceptor weight ratios and concentration of solvent additive, the P-MPU1-based PSC exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 7.52% (Jsc= 12.37 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.98 V, and fill factor = 0.62), which is much higher than that for a P3HT-MPU1-based device (2.16%) prepared under identical conditions. The higher value for the P-MPU1-based device relative to the P3HT-MPU1-based one is related to the low energy loss and more balanced charge transport in the device based on the P donor. These results indicate that alteration of the absorption spectra and electrochemical energy levels of non-fullerene acceptors, and appropriate selection of the polymer donor with complementary absorption profile, is a promising means to further boost the performance of PSCs."

Three sets of DHA conditions that explore the effects of solvent, temperature, and catalyst were employed to find the optimal conditions for the synthesis of two PDI–TPD–PDI derivatives. We then selected one PDI–TPD–PDI for use as a non-fullerene acceptor in organic solar cell devices with the donor polymer PBDB-T. Active layer bulk-heterojunction blends were modified using several post-deposition treatments, including thermal annealing, solvent vapour annealing, and high boiling solvent additives.

Employing this synthetic protocol has enabled the facile evaluation of a series of organic dyes in a PDI-dye-PDI framework. Material properties are largely dictated by the PDI components, but the incorporation of either thienoisoindigo, diketopyrrolopyrrole or isoindigo has been shown to influence the ionization potential and absorption profiles of the final materials. Solution-processable organic solar cell devices were fabricated to investigate the influence of the different dye cores on photovoltaic performance when paired with the donor polymer PTB7-Th. It was found that the diketopyrrolopyrrole-based material out-performed the other organic dyes, demonstrating energy losses of less than 0.6 eV, promising efficiencies when cast from non-halogenated solvents and the ability to dictate self-assembly induced by small volume fractions of the high-boiling solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane to reach best device efficiencies of 4.1%."
36,10.1039/C6TA08729A,2017.0,Panchromatic ternary/quaternary polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells based on novel silicon naphthalocyanine and silicon phthalocyanine dye sensitizers,"More efficient light harvesting throughout the whole solar spectrum by introducing third and fourth components offers a new pathway towards the development of high efficiency organic solar cells based on polymer/fullerene blends. Recently, dye molecules have been utilized as promising light harvesting photosensitizers in the near-IR region. Herein, we report the design, synthesis and application of a novel silicon naphthalocyanine (SiNC-1) as an efficient photosensitizer in single dye ternary devices as well as in multi-colored co-sensitized quaternary devices, incorporating a silicon phthalocyanine (SiPC-0 or SiPC-1) as the fourth component to complement the spectral absorption of the SiNC-1. The dominant complex charge transfer/transport mechanism behind the enhanced photosensitivity of the ternary blend has been investigated by means of electrical, optical, and advanced characterization techniques. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements on multi-colored dye sensitized devices covering the UV-vis as well as near-IR regions from 350 up to 900 nm outline apparent signal characteristics of each single dye, corroborating the effective contribution of both SiPC and SiNC dyes to enhancing the short-circuit current density (JSC). Our results further illustrate the potential of the multi-colored dye sensitization concept as a powerful approach to mitigate the non-ideal optical absorption normally encountered in organic-based optoelectronic devices."

The rapid progress of the field is credited to the synthesis of a large number of novel polymers with specially tunable optoelectronic properties, a better control over the nano-morphology of photoactive blend layers, the introduction of various effective interfacial layers, new device architectures and a deeper understanding of device physics. We will review the pioneering materials for polymer-fullerene solar cells and trace the progress of concepts driving their development. We discuss the evolution of morphology control, interfacial layers and device structures fully exploring the potential of photoactive materials. In order to guide a further increase in power conversion efficiency of OPV, the current understanding of the process of free charge carrier generation and the origin of the photovoltage is summarized followed by a perspective on how to overcome the limitations for industrializing PSCs."
38,10.1039/C6EE01026A,2016.0,Development of isomer-free fullerene bisadducts for efficient polymer solar cells,"Isomer-free fullerene bisadducts have been predicted to be high-performance acceptors for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. They can afford a higher open-circuit voltage compared with monoadducts because of the higher LUMO levels, and can also provide a higher short-circuit current and fill factor compared with the isomer mixture because of reduced energetic disorder. However, the application of isomer-free fullerene bisadducts in BHJ solar cells has met synthetic challenges. In this work, a new regioselective synthesis method, the so-called prebisaddition-confined bisfunctionalization (PCB), was developed for preparing isomer-free C60 bisadducts. This synthesis was highly selective for obtaining homo- and hetero-bisadducts with an “e configuration”. Isomer-free C60 bisadducts, e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, e-NC60BA and e-PPMF, were successfully synthesized via PCB. The gram-scale synthesis of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 was realized. Single crystals of e-PPMF and two intermediates were obtained. Electrochemical studies proved that a single isomer has reduced energetic disorder. e-PPMF featuring a compact methano group and a solubilizing side chain showed good performance in P3HT and low-bandgap polymer solar cells. A decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.11% was achieved in solar cells consisting of e-PPMF and the low-bandgap polymer PPDT2FBT. The outstanding photovoltaic performance of e-PPMF among the fullerene bisadducts results from its better packing and reduced energetic disorder."

Femtosecond laser transient absorption spectral measurements revealed that fast electron transfer from TPA to the singlet-excited state of NDI occurred to form a charge-separated state (TPA*+-NDI*--C60) with a rate constant of ~1012 s-1, followed by the charge shift reaction from NDI*- to C60 to produce the charge-separated state (TPA*+-NDI-C60*-) that decayed via back electron transfer with a rate constant of 4.4  109 s-1 (with a corresponding lifetime of 230 ps). Organic bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using the triad S3 as an n-type semiconductor along with the conventional donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was found to reach 3.03% before annealing and 4.85% after annealing in the optimized devices. To rationalize the performance of organic photovoltaic devices, the atomic force microscopy was used to study the morphology of P3HT: S3 blend surfaces, which were found to be well interlaced and free from perceptible projections, lumps, or indentations."

In spite of the impressive development achieved by organic photovoltaics throughout the last decades, especially in terms of reported power conversion efficiencies, there are still important technological and fundamental obstacles to circumvent before they can be implemented into reliable and long-lasting applications. Regarding device processing, the synthesis of highly soluble polymeric semiconductors first, and then fullerene derivatives, was initially considered as an important breakthrough that would definitely change the fabrication of photovoltaics once and for all. The potential and the expectation raised by this technology is such that it is very difficult to keep track of the most significant progresses being now published in different and even monographic journals. In this paper, we review the development of polymeric solar cells from its origin to the most efficient devices published to date. We separate these achievements into three different categories traditionally followed by the scientific community to push devices over 10% power conversion efficiency: active materials, strategies—fabrication/processing procedures—that can mainly modify the active film morphology, and all the different cell layout/architectures that have been used in order to extract as high a photocurrent as possible from the Sun. The synthesis of new donors, the use of additives and postprocessing techniques, buffer interlayers, inverted and tandem designs are some of the most important aspects that are reviewed in detail in this paper. All have equally contributed to develop this technology and bring it at the doors of commercialization."

The fullerene-attached copolymers had good solubility (>30 g L–1 in chlorobenzene) with high molecular weights (Mn > 20 000). The diblock copolymer films formed clear nanostructures with sizes of ca. 20 nm, driven by crystallization of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) block and aggregation of the fullerene groups, as observed in AFM phase images. The copolymer-based photovoltaic device showed a power conversion efficiency of 2.5%, with a much higher fill factor of 0.63 in comparison to the previously reported single component devices. These results indicate that rational material designs enable the construction of suitable donor–acceptor nanostructures for photovoltaic applications, without relying on the ..."

Metallofullerene-grafted polymer (Gd@C82-PVK) was firstly synthesized and characterized by GPC, UV-vis, FTIR, DSC, XPS. The results demonstrated that the fullerenes had chemically combined with PVK. Fluorescence spectra suggested that the grafted fullerenes had certain influence on the fluorescence properties of the polymer. This is due to the better electron-attractive ability of fullerenes, which contributed a lot to form the electron donor-acceptor systems in fullerene-grafted poly(N-vinylcarbazole). Potential applications of this kind of materials in optical and memory devices were expected."

Here, the design and synthesis of a novel donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer (PIT2FBT) based on an asymmetric‐indenothiophene donor and a difluorinated benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole acceptor is demonstrated. PIT2FBT exhibits a wide optical bandgap of 1.82 eV with a large ionization potential of 5.54 eV. Through systematic morphology control and device engineering, the best performance solar cell based on PIT2FBT shows a high PCE of 9.01% in combination with a large V OC of 1.0 V. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE is the highest for single‐junction polymer fullerene solar cells with V OCs up to 1.0 V. At the same time, the influences of solvent additive on the active layer morphology together with the resulting device performance are investigated in‐depth. These findings and detailed studies provide an important guidance to tune and optimize the morphology and photovoltaic properties of indenothiophene‐based copolymers, which are promising candidates for short‐wavelength absorbing materials in tandem PSCs."

Both samples show a transient absorption similar to the absorption of the parent C60 solution. There is a lack of triplet-triplet annihilation and of a O2-quenching process in the dry sample. On the contrary, the O2-quenching process is very efficient in the H2O-suspended samples (kq(O2)=(1.9±0.5)×108 dm3 mol−1 s−1) and results in the formation of singlet oxygen, which is detected by its emission at 1270 nm.

In these donor–bridge–acceptor systems, the fullerene unit (acceptor) is connected through a cyclopropane ring to an ethynyl thienyl fragment (bridge) which binds a trimethylsilyl or platinum alkynyl fragment (donor). All derivatives are NLO-active, as determined by the electric field induced second harmonic generation technique, but the fullerene platinum alkynyl complexes are characterized by a particularly large second-order NLO response. Substitution of the thienyl fragment by a terthiophene leads to an increase of the NLO performance by using trimethylsilyl as a donor group, whereas no effect is observed in the case of platinum derivatives.

P1 and P2 with IDT and DTS central cores demonstrate stronger absorbance than the compounds P3 and P4 with anthracene and pyrene cores. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.39% was achieved for the OSC based on P1 as the acceptor material and P3HT as the donor material (1 : 1, w/w), which is the highest value for polymer bulk-heterojunction OSCs based on isoindigo small molecules as non-fullerene acceptors.

Additionally, P3HT:PC70BM blends containing various percentages of the herein synthesized hybrid material comprising rr-P3HT and C70 were investigated via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) in an effort to understand the effect of the hybrids as additives on the morphology and nanophase separation of this typically used active layer blend for OPVs."
53,10.1039/C5PY01674F,2016.0,Synthesis of a [60]fullerene-end-capped polyacetylene derivative – a “rod-sphere” molecule from a “coil-sphere” precursor,"Herein, we report the synthesis of a hybrid material composed of a head-to-head substituted polyacetylene end-capped with [60]fullerene through anionic polymerization. The synthesis was carried out in three successive steps: anionic polymerization of 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene, anionic addition of the resulting living chains towards C60, and dehydrogenation of the polymer segment in the presence of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). Since the precursor polymer is a coil-like polybutadiene derivative and the dehydrogenated polymer is a rod-like conjugated segment, the molecular hybrids underwent a change from a “coil-sphere” to “rod-sphere” conformation before and after dehydrogenation. The structure and properties of the molecular hybrids were investigated via1H NMR, FTIR, GPC, FLS, UV and TGA. The self-assembly behaviors of both molecular hybrids in THF were studied using DLS and TEM. Moreover, we also observed an obvious optical limiting property of the hybrid product, which indicates that it may potentially be utilized as a functional opto-electronic material."

The number-average molecular weights of P1 and P2 were 1.76 × 104 and 4.58 × 103 g mol−1, respectively, and the corresponding polydispersity indices were 1.47 and 2.16, respectively. Photoluminescence titrations and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the supramolecular complexes between these polymers and a fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), exhibited moderate first step-wise association constants of Ka1 (3.4 × 104 M−1 for P1 and 1.0 × 104 M−1 for P2). Furthermore, ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemical measurements showed that P1 cations were induced in the P1–PC61BM complex, indicating efficient electron transfer from P1 to PC61BM. A P1/PC61BM device with an equivalent weight of 1 : 1 exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 0.53%, which was higher than that of a device composed of a P2/PC61BM blend (0.47%). The PCE improvement was attributed to stronger non-covalent interactions between P1 and PC61BM, suggesting that P1 is a promising material for polymeric solar cell applications."

Soluble bis-adducts of C60 have great potential for improving the VOC in PSCs because of their high LUMO level. In this work, we have developed a novel o-xylenyl C60 bis-adduct (OXCBA) via a [4 + 2] cycloaddition between C60 and an irreversible diene intermediate from α,α′-dibromo-o-xylene. OXCBA was successfully applied as the electron acceptor with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in a PSC, showing a high efficiency of 5.31% with VOC of 0.83 V. This composite showed a nearly 50% enhancement in efficiency compared to the P3HT:PCBM control device (3.68% with VOC of 0.59 V). Furthermore, tuning the molar ratio between C60 and the α,α′-dibromo-o-xylene group from 1:1 to 1:3 in the reaction scheme enables facile control over the number of o-xylenyl solubilizing groups ultimately tethered to the fullerene, thus producing o..."

61,,2015.0,Study of Device Physics and Active Layer Morphology in Polymer-Fullerene Based Solar Cells: The Role of Vertical Phase Segregation and Organic/Metal Interface,"Author(s): Zhang, Guangye | Advisor(s): Schwartz, Benjamin J | Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are flexible, low cost and easily processable, which provides them with a very short energy payback time compared to most PV technologies and makes them strong candidates for industrial mass production. The richness of organic synthesis has afforded a large library of molecular semiconductors, among which the combination of conjugated polymers as electron donors and fullerenes as electron acceptors has been demonstrated to be the best sellers as building blocks of OPV devices. In the past few years, the majority of research focus on OPVs has been devoted to improving their power conversion efficiencies by using new combinations of polymer and fullerene materials. Most devices are based on blend-cast bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), in which a polymer and fullerene are mixed together in a solution that is then used to cast the active layer of the organic solar cell. Because the nm-scale morphology of the film depends on so many of the details of how it is cast, the device performance of blend-cast BHJ solar cells is hypersensitive to the processing kinetics of the active layer. Thus, for any new set of OPV materials, an Edisonian approach involving the fabrication of hundreds of blend-cast devices is needed to find the processing conditions that lead to the optimal morphology and best device performance. In this thesis, I will focus on two main contributions that I have made to help rationally design OPVs.First, our group recently has gone beyond the traditional method of simply blending the donor and acceptor material by developing a new technique to process the active layer of OPVs called sequential processing. This method takes advantage of a pair of quasi-orthogonal solvents to process the two components used in the active layer separately. By studying a series of crystalline polymers with controlled regioregularities and polydispersities, I have found that increasing polymer crystallinity produces the opposite behavior in BHJ solar cells fabricated by sequentially-processing and blend-casting. This suggests that the two processing techniques are complementary and provides guidance on selecting the appropriate processing technique for a given polymer. Second, I have studied the performance and device physics of a new series of controllably tuned fullerene derivatives applied in traditional blend-cast active layers. We obtained a series of carefully designed 1,4-dibenzyl fullerene bisadducts synthesized by our collaborators in Prof. Yves Rubin's group. The fullerenes have methoxy substituents selectively positioned on pendant phenyl rings, which allows us to examine the effect of the subtle molecular changes on both macroscopic solar cell performance and the underlying device physics. Through carrier recombination studies, I have learned that solar cell performance often depends on the material's surface energy and the vertical phase segregation caused by this surface energy in the active layer. The results will allow us to offer new directions on how to select the best device structure with a given new fullerene material. Finally, I have helped to make an interesting discovery during my study of the device physics of as-cast sequentially processed solar cells. I found that the specific type of vertical phase segregation in the as-cast devices gives rise to dark carriers, whose presence can be measured using the charge extraction by linear increasing voltage (CELIV) technique. The dark carriers directly clearly are created by the evaporation of metal electrodes because I found no such carriers when non-metal interfacial layers were inserted between the metal and the organic layer. Through capacitance analysis and transmission electron microscopy studies, we found this n-type doping is caused by metal penetration into the fullerene domain. These findings could have significant impact on determining device performance, explaining device physics and guiding future research directions."
62,10.1002/smll.202304368,2023.0,Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptors for Ternary Polymer Solar Cells with Low Energy Loss and Efficiency Over 18.,"Ternary polymer solar cells(PSCs) have been identified as an effective approach to improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary PSCs. However, most of the third component, especially Y-series non-fullerene acceptors, is a fused ring acceptor which often requires a rather tedious synthesis and the use of hazardous organostannane reagents. In this work, two nonfused ring acceptors IOEH-4F and IOEH-N2F are synthesized by a green synthetic route and incorporated into PM6:Y6 blend. Encouragingly, the IOEH-4F and IOEH-N2F-based ternary PSCs exhibited more efficient charge transfer, exciton separation, and lower energy loss than PM6:Y6-based PSCs. And the IOEH-4F and IOEH-N2F-based ternary PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 17.80% and 18.13%, respectively, which are higher than that of PM6:Y6 based PSCs (16.18%). Notably, these PCE values are also the highest PCEs for ternary PSCs including non-fused ring acceptors. Importantly, even when the IOEH-N2F:Y6 ratios increased from 0.05:1.2 to 0.50:1.2, the PCE of IOEH-N2F-based ternary PSCs (16.70%) are still higher than that of PM6:Y6 based PSCs, indicating the great potential for cost saving. It is believed that the findings will help the design of better nonfused ring acceptors and the optimization of corresponding ternary PSCs with cost-saving advantage."

We present the synthesis and self-assembling properties of a monomer featuring two complementary units, a C60 derivative and an exTTF-based macrocycle, that interact mainly through π-π, charge-transfer, and van der Waals interactions. Thanks to the preorganization in the host part, a remarkable log K(a)=5.1±0.5 in CHCl3 at room temperature is determined for the host-guest couple. In accordance with the large binding constant, the monomer self-assembles in the gas phase, in solution, and in the solid state to form linear supramolecular polymers with a very high degree of polymerization. A MW above 150 kDa has been found experimentally in solution, while in the solid state the monomer forms extraordinarily long, straight, and uniform fibers with lengths reaching several microns."
64,10.3390/polym14183812,2022.0,Alkyl Chain Engineering of Low Bandgap Non-Fullerene Acceptors for High-Performance Organic Solar Cells: Branched vs. Linear Alkyl Side Chains,"In this work, we report the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of IEBICO-4F, IEHICO-4F, IOICO-4F, and IDICO-4F non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) bearing different types of alkyl chains (2-ehtylhexyl (EH), 2-ethylbutyl (EB), n-octyl (O), and n-decyl (D), respectively). These NFAs are based on the central indacenodithiophene (IDT) donor core and the same terminal group of 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F), albeit with different side chains appended to the thiophene bridge unit. Although the side chains induced negligible differences between the NFAs in terms of optical band gaps and molecular energy levels, they did lead to changes in their melting points and crystallinity. The NFAs with branched alkyl chains exhibited weaker intermolecular interactions and crystallinity than those with linear alkyl chains. Organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated by blending these NFAs with the p-type polymer PTB7-Th. The NFAs with appended branched alkyl chains (IEHICO-4F and IEBICO-4F) possessed superior photovoltaic properties than those with appended linear alkyl chains (IOICO-4F and IDICO-4F). This result can be ascribed mainly to the thin-film morphology. Furthermore, the NFA-based blend films with appended branched alkyl chains exhibited the optimal degree of aggregation and miscibility, whereas the NFA-based blend films with appended linear alkyl chains exhibited higher levels of self-aggregation and lower miscibility between the NFA molecule and the PTB7-Th polymer. We demonstrate that changing the alkyl chain on the π-bridging unit in fused-ring-based NFAs is an effective strategy for improving their photovoltaic performance in bulk heterojunction-type OSCs."

Then, a double-monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers. The isolated well-defined model oligomers indicated polymer structures. Kinetic studies based on NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopies shed light on the polymerization process. Interestingly, the resulted metallopolymers with dπ-pπ conjugations are very promising electron transport layer materials which can boost photovoltaic performance of an organic solar cell, with power conversion efficiency up to 18.28% based on the PM6:EH-HD-4F non-fullerene system.

The three polymer donors TQ1, PTNT, and PTB7-Th were paired with the fullerene acceptor PC71BM for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layers to evaluate the CIL. The modification of the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode with a ∼3 nm thin layer of PNDIT10N yielded a significant reduction of 0.8 eV in the work function, reducing it from 4.6 to 3.8 eV, effectively transforming ITO to a functioning cathode. PSCs with a TQ1/PC71BM BHJ layer and incorporating a PNDIT10N interlayer were found to have a high Jsc value of 10.5 mA cm–2, Voc value of 909 mV, and an FF value of 68%, resulting in the highest PCE of 6.7% for TQ1 donor in the inverted device structure.

The percentage of functionalized side chain varied between 10 and 50 mol% for each copolymer. Using post-polymerization reactions, the ester functions in the alkyl side chain were hydrolyzed to yield an alcohol or acid group. These groups are available for further functionalization reactions, so a wide variety of secondary functionalities may be covalently attached to the conjugated polymer. The copolymers were applied in polymer: fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) with [6,6]-phenyl -C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as electron acceptor. The influence of side-chain functionalities on absorption, device performance and layer morphology depends on the ratio and nature of the functionalized side chains.

However, the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs needs to be increased for their future application. The key issue for improving the PCE of PSCs is the design and synthesis of high-efficiency conjugated polymer donors and fullerene acceptors for the photovoltaic materials. For the acceptor materials, several fullerene-bisadduct acceptors with high LUMO energy levels have demonstrated excellent photovoltaic performance in PSCs with P3HT as a donor. In this Focus Review, recent progress in high-efficiency fullerene-bisadduct acceptors is discussed, including the bisadduct of PCBM, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA), DMPCBA, NCBA, and bisTOQC.

Further improvements of the photovoltaic performance are a significant challenge in NFA‐PSCs based on binary donor:acceptor blends. In this study, ternary PSCs are fabricated by incorporating a fullerene derivative, PC61BM, into a combination of a polymer donor (PBDB‐TF) and a fused‐ring NFA (Y6) and a very high PCE of 16.5% (certified as 16.2%) is recorded. Detailed studies suggest that the loading of PC61BM into the PBDB‐TF:Y6 blend can not only enhance the electron mobility but also can increase the electroluminescence quantum efficiency, leading to balanced charge transport and reduced nonradiative energy losses simultaneously. This work suggests that utilizing the complementary advantages of fullerene and NFAs is a promising way to finely tune the detailed photovoltaic parameters and further improve the PCEs of PSCs."

The molecules are differing by the nature of the solubilizing groups on the π-spacer and/or the presence of fluorine atoms on the peripheral electron-accepting units. The optoelectronic properties of the molecules are characterized in solution, in thin film and in photovoltaic devices. The nature of the solubilizing groups has a minor influence on the optoelectronic properties but affects the organization in the solid state. On the other hand, the fluorine atoms influence the optoelectronics properties and increase the photostability of the molecules in thin films. Compare to reference ITIC , the extended molecules show a wider absorption across the visible range and higher LUMO energy levels. The photovoltaic performances of the four NFAs were assessed in binary blends using PM6 (PBDB-T-2F) as the donating polymer and in ternary blends with ITIC-4F . Solar cells (active area 0.27 cm²) show power conversion efficiencies of up to 11.1% when ternary blends are processed from non-halogenated solvents, without any thermal post-treatment nor use of halogenated additives, making this process compatible with industrial requirements."

However, most NFAs featured a large fused-ring backbone, which usually require tedious multiple-step synthesis and are not applicable to commercial application. An alternative strategy is to develop non-fused NFAs, which possess synthetic simplicity and facile tunability in optoelectronic properties and solid-state microstructures. In this work, we report two non-fused NFAs, BTCIC and BTCIC-4Cl, based on an A-D-A'-D-A architecture, which possess the same electron-deficient benzothiadiazole central core but different electron-withdrawing terminal groups. The optical properties, energy levels, and molecular crystallinities were finely tuned by changing the terminal groups. Moreover, a decent power conversion efficiency of 9.3% and 10.5% has been achieved by BTCIC and BTCIC-4Cl, respectively, by blending them with an appropriate polymer donor. These results demonstrate the potential of A-D-A'-D-A type non-fused NFAs for high-performance OSCs. Further development of non-fused NFAs will be very fruitful by employing appropriate building blocks and via side chain optimizations."

In the present polymer, [60]fullerene pearls and diamine linkers were attached to each other by methanocarbonyl connectors. The molecular weight M w of the polymer was determined to be 4.5 × 10 4 on the basis of the TOF-MS, and a GPC analysis of the polymer using polystyrene standards showed a weight-average molecular weight of 5.3 × 10 4 .

There was observed a large downfield-shift of the cyclopropane methyne proton in the 1 H-NMR spectra from 4.57 ppm of the ethyl ester to 5.78 ppm of the polyamide.

First attempts to deposit light‐harvesting layers from aqueous or alcoholic nanoparticle dispersions instead have been successful on laboratory scale, enabling future eco‐friendly production of organic solar cells. In this work, a scalable high‐throughput continuous‐flow microfluidic system is employed to synthesize surfactant‐free organic semiconductor dispersions by nanoprecipitation. By adjusting the differential speed of the syringe pumps, the concentration of the initial solute and the irradiation of the microfluidic chip, the synthesis can be controlled for tailored dispersion concentrations and nanoparticle sizes.

Herein, an ester substituted poly(thiophene vinylene) derivative, PTVT-T, was designed and synthesized in very few steps by adopting commercially available raw materials. The ester groups on the thiophene units enable PTVT-T to have a planar and stable conformation. Moreover, PTVT-T presents a wide absorption band and strong aggregation effect in solution, which are the key characteristics needed to realize high performance in non-fullerene-acceptor (NFA)-based OSCs. We then prepared OSCs by blending PTVT-T with three representative fullerene- and NF-based acceptors, PC71BM, IT-4F and BTP-eC9. It was found that PTVT-T can work well with all the acceptors, showing great potential to match new emerging NFAs. Particularly, a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 16.20% is achieved in a PTVT-T:BTP-eC9-based device, which is the highest value among the counterparts based on PTV derivatives.

Self-assembly between P4 and F1 through “three-point” complementary hydrogen bonding is studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. A large Stern-Volmer constant (KSV) of 1.2 × 105 M−1 is observed from fluorescence quenching experiments, revealing strong complexation between these two components. Solar cells employing P4 and F1 at different weight ratios as active layers are fabricated and tested; corresponding thin film morphologies are studied in detail by optical imaging and atomic force microscopy. Correlations between polymer complex structures, film morphologies, and device performance are discussed. Thermal stability of benchmark poly(3-hexylthiophene) bulk heterojunction solar cells is found to be improved by the addition of a few weight percent of P4/F1 complexes as compatibilizers. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Fullerene networks are good semiconductors. In this paper, heterostructure complexes composed of C60 polymer networks on atomically thin dielectric substrates are modeled. Small tensile and compressive deformations make it possible to ensure appropriate placement of monolayer boron nitride with fullerene networks. The choice of a piezoelectric boron nitride substrate was dictated by interest in their applicability in mechanoelectric, photoelectronic, and electro-optical devices with the ability to control their properties. The results we obtained show that C60 polymer/h-BN heterostructures are stable compounds. The van der Waals interaction that arises between them affects their electronic and optical properties."
80,,2018.0,Synthesis and Characterization of Acceptor Polymers for All-Polymer Solar Cells and Photodetectors,"The development of polymer semiconductors has become an important topic due to its advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, light weight, and capability to fabricate flexible large-area devices. For example, as the need for new clean energy sources is increasing, polymer solar cells (PSCs) are being developed rapidly and becoming a promising alternative to silicon solar cells. This thesis focuses on the applications of polymer semiconductors in two active fields of polymeric optoelectronics: PSCs and polymer photodetectors (PPDs). Heretofore, PSCs and PPDs were fabricated commonly using a blend of a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative as the active layer. Despite the wide use of fullerene derivatives, their limitations such as low absorption, morphological instability, and high costs, created a strong need to develop new acceptor materials. Therefore, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) and allpolymer photodetectors (all-PPDs) based on a blend of conjugated polymers acting as both electron donor and acceptor are being actively pursued. We have made concerted efforts to prepare high-performance all-PSCs and all-PPDs, by specifically modifying the acceptor molecular structure, and rationally choosing suitable donor and acceptor combinations. This aspect of our work had two main facets:  * Material synthesis: the design, synthesis and characterization of novel acceptor polymers.  * Device engineering: the fabrication, optimization and characterization of all-PSCs and all-PPDs. Our efforts in the design of novel acceptor polymers focused on crystallinity and energy level engineering via structural modifications like backbone and sidechain modulation. Also, a comprehensive comparison of the characteristic functional properties of acceptor polymers was undertaken. Binary devices using donor and acceptor polymers with complementary absorption or suitable energy level offset, and ternary devices were studied to further improve the performance of all- PSCs. High efficiencies of 8.0% and 9.0% are achieved for binary all-PSCs and ternary all-PSCs, respectively. Additionally, high-performance all-PPDs exhibiting low dark current density (Jd) and high responsivity (R) under -5 V bias were demonstrated. Based on the results presented herein, we are now moving closer to understanding the correlation between the polymer structure, blend morphology, and device performance. This thesis also provides a guideline for developing all-PSCs and all-PPDs with improved performance."
81,,2000.0,Synthesis of hybrid fullerene-containing polymers with the controlled molecular mass characteristics of polymer fragments,"Star-shaped fullerene-containing polymers were synthesized by the reactions of nucleophilic addition of active poly(ethylene oxides) and living polystyrenes to C 60 fullerene. The resulting polymers were used to prepare new hybrid star-shaped polymers with C 60 fullerene as a core and poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) as arms, as well as the hybrid polymers of complex architecture based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) onto which the star-shaped fullerene-containing poly(styrenes) were grafted. Poly(acrylate) fragments involved in star-shaped hybrid polymers were subjected to hydrolysis. The reaction of fullerene, which was preliminarily activated with potassium tert-butoxide, with the carbonyl groups of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) yielded an irregular network polymer. The products were analyzed by HPLC, and the analysis data support formation of hybrid polymers."

The higher fullerene content is achieved by means of introducing tetraphenylporphyrine (TPP) and KBr into composites. The synthesis includes the formation of C60–TPP complex and its further interaction with polymer. The formation of C60–TPP complex was confirmed by 13C NMR, SANS, and translational diffusion. The hydrodynamic and electrooptical studies of C60–TPP–PVP complexes indicate the higher symmetry of the polymer coil in the complex as compared to PVP. The C60–PVP–KBr composites were also obtained by the solid state interaction under vacuum, KBr promoting the destruction of fullerene aggregates."
83,10.1002/adfm.202400729,2024.0,Design and Synthesis of Dibenzothiadiazolopyrrolothiophene (DBTPT)‐Based Acceptors for Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Cells,"The central core in non‐fullerene acceptors (NFAs) plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. To further advance the development of OPV cells, it is crucial to synthesize novel central cores for constructing high‐performance NFAs. Here, dibenzothiadiazolopyrrolothiophene (DBTPT) is introduced, a ladder‐type [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4‐e]indole‐fused pentacyclic thiophene unit, into photovoltaic materials. By employing the DBTPT unit as the rigid molecular backbone and modifying the side chain of the thiophene π‐bridge, two new acceptor‐π‐acceptor’‐donor‐acceptor’‐π‐acceptor (A‐π‐A'DA’‐π‐A)‐type acceptors (T6 and T9) are synthesized. The effects of lateral alkyl and alkoxy side chains on the optoelectronic properties, charge transport, and molecular packing order are systematically investigated. When blended with polymer donor Poly[(2,6‐(4,8‐bis(5‐(2‐ethylhexyl)thiophen‐2‐yl)‐benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b']dithiophene))‐alt‐(5,5‐(1',3'‐di‐2‐thienyl‐5'7'‐bis(2‐ethylhexyl)benzo[1',2'‐c:4',5'‐c']dithiophene‐4,8‐dione))] (PBDB‐T), the blend film based on T9 with alkoxy side chains shows favorable molecular stacking and phase separation, resulting in excellent charge transfer performance. Benefiting low energetic disorder, PBDB‐T:T9‐based cell achieves an efficiency of 12.6% with a markedly low energy loss of 0.568 eV. The preliminary results demonstrate that the DBTPT unit has great potential for the construction of novel NFAs for high‐performance OPV cells."

These adducts show lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels to be at the right position to consider these compounds as electron-transporting materials for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Selected derivatives were applied into inverted (p–i–n configuration) perovskite device architectures, fabricated on flexible polymer substrates, with large active areas (1 cm2). The highest power conversion efficiency, reaching 13.61%, was obtained for the 6′-acetamido-1′,4′-dihydro-naphtho[2′,3′:1,2][5,6]fullerene-C60 (NHAc-ICMA).

Methyl methacrylate and 6-azido hexyl methacrylate were then randomly copolymerized via re- versible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization to build polymer backbones with well-controlled molecular weights and copolymer compositions. Finally, these two moi- eties were covalently assembled into a series of well-defined side chain fullerene polymers (SFPs) via the copper-mediated click reaction which was verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1 H NMR. The fullerene loadings of the result- ant polymers were estimated by thermogravimetric analysis and UV-vis spectroscopy, demonstrating consistent and high conversions in most of the samples. The morphology studies of the SFPs were performed both in solution and on solid sub- strates. Very intriguing self-aggregation behaviors were detected by both gel permeation chromatography and dynamic light scattering analyses. Furthermore, the scanning electron microscopic images of these polymers showed the formation of various supramolecular nanoparticle assemblies and crystal- line-like clusters depending on the fullerene contents and poly- mer chain lengths.

88,10.3389/fchem.2021.687996,2021.0,Fluorination Enables Tunable Molecular Interaction and Photovoltaic Performance in Non-Fullerene Solar Cells Based on Ester-Substituted Polythiophene,"Owing to the advantages of low synthetic cost and high scalability of synthesis, polythiophene and its derivatives (PTs) have been of interest in the community of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Nevertheless, the typical efficiency of PT based photovoltaic devices reported so far is much lower than those of the prevailing push-pull type conjugated polymer donors. Recent studies have underscored that the excessively low miscibility between PT and nonfullerene acceptor is the major reason accounting for the unfavorable active layer morphology and the inferior performance of OPVs based on a well-known PT, namely PDCBT-Cl and a non-halogenated nonfullerene acceptor IDIC. How to manipulate the miscibility between PT and acceptor molecule is important for further improving the device efficiency of this class of potentially low-cost blend systems. In this study, we introduced different numbers of F atoms to the end groups of IDIC to tune the intermolecular interaction of the hypo-miscible blend system (PDCBT-Cl:IDIC). Based on calorimetric, microscopic, and scattering characterizations, a clear relationship between the number of F atoms, miscibility, and device performance was established. With the increased number of F atoms in IDIC, the resulting acceptors exhibited enhanced miscibility with PDCBT-Cl, and the domain sizes of the blend films were reduced substantially. As a result, distinctively different photovoltaic performances were achieved for these blend systems. This study demonstrates that varying the number of F atoms in the acceptors is a feasible way to manipulate the molecular interaction and the film morphology toward high-performance polythiophene:nonfullerene based OPVs."
89,10.1021/JP053088H,2005.0,Synthesis and self-assembly of [60]fullerene containing sulfobetaine polymer in aqueous solution.,"A well-defined poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA-b-C60) was synthesized using the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique and betainized with 1,3-sulfobetaine to yield a Bet-PDMAEMA-b-C60. The solution properties were then studied by light transmittance, viscometric, 1H NMR laser light scattering, and transmission electron macroscopic techniques. It was found that Bet-PDMAEMA-b-C60 exhibits an upper critical solution temperature (USCT) similar to that observed for Bet-PDMAEMA in aqueous solution. However, the modification of Bet-PDMAEMA with a C60 molecule increases the UCST of Bet-PDMAEMA in solution, which is a function of the solution ionic strength. Addition of a small amount of salt increases the UCST, similar to polyelectrolyte systems, while the presence of an excess amount of salt leads to a decrease in the UCST, attributed to the antipolyelectrolyte effect of polyampholytes. In aqueous salt solution, Bet-PDMAEMA-b-C60 chains self-assemble into micelles that coexist with unimeric Bet-PDMAEMA-b-C60 chains. TEM studies revealed that the system agglomerates when the temperature exceeds the UCST."

Current research is focusing on the construction of well-defined fullerene nano/microcrystals that possess desirable structures and morphologies. Further tuning the intermolecular interaction of the fullerene nano/microcrystals by use of pressure is an efficient way to modify their structures and properties, such as creation of nanoscale polymer structures and new hybrid materials, which expands the potential of such nanoscale materials for direct device components. In this paper, we review our recent progress in the construction of fullerene nanostructures and their structural transformation induced by high pressure. Fullerene nano/microcrystals with controllable size, morphology and structure have been synthesized through the self-assembly of fullerene molecules by a solvent-assisted method. By virtue of high pressure, the structures, components, and intermolecular interactions of the assemblied fullerene nano/microcrystals can be finely tuned, thereby modifying the optical and electronic properties of the nanostructures. Several examples on high pressure induced novel structural phase transition in typical fullerene nanocrystals with C60 or C70 cage serving as building blocks are presented, including high pressure induced amorphization of the nanocrystals and their bulk moduli, high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) induced polymerization in C60 nanocrystals, pressure tuned reversible polymerization in ferrocene-doped C60/C70 single crystal, as well as unique long-range ordered crystal with amorphous nanoclusters serving as building blocks in solvated C60 crystals, which brings new physical insight into the understanding of order and disorder concept and new approaches to the design of superhard carbon materials.

The synthesised copolymer was characterised and evaluated through an electrochemical process, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) measurements. The synthesised copolymer has a bandgap of 2.09 eV, HOMO and LUMO energy levels of -5.21 and -3.12 eV, respectively. The HOMO-LUMO of the synthesised conjugated copolymer is closed with the HOMO-LUMO of Fullerene; therefore, the conjugated copolymer is a potential material for the fabrication of organic solar cell."

The synthesis highlighted the regiospecific multiaddition reaction for C(60) surface functionalization and the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between alkyne functionalized C(60) and azide functionalized polymer to give rise to shape amphiphiles with precisely defined surface chemistry and molecular topology. When 1,4-dioxane/DMF mixture was used as the common solvent and water as the selective solvent, these shape amphiphiles exhibited versatile self-assembled micellar morphologies which can be tuned by changing various parameters, such as molecular topology, polymer tail length, and initial molecular concentration, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy and light scattering experiments. In the low molecular concentration range of equal or less than 0.25 (wt) %, micellar morphology of the series of PS(n)-AC(60) studied was always spheres, while the series of 2PS(n)-AC(60) formed vesicles. Particularly, PS(44)-AC(60) and 2PS(23)-AC(60) are synthesized as a topological isomer pair of these shape amphiphiles. PS(44)-AC(60) formed spherical micelles while 2PS(23)-AC(60) generated bilayer vesicles under identical conditions. The difference in the self-assembly of PS(n)-AC(60) and 2PS(n)-AC(60) was understood by the molecular shape aspect ratio. The stretching ratio of PS tails decreased with increasing PS tail length in the spherical micelles of PS(n)-AC(60), indicating a micellar behavior that changes from small molecular surfactant-like to amphiphilic block copolymer-like. For the series of PS(n)-AC(60) in the high molecular concentration range [>0.25 (wt) %], their micellar morphological formation of spheres, cylinders, and vesicles was critically dependent upon both the initial molecular concentration and the PS tail length. On the other hand, the series of 2PS(n)-AC(60) remained in the state of bilayer vesicles in the same concentration range. Combining both of the experimental results obtained in the low and high molecular concentrations, a systematic morphological phase diagram was constructed for the series of PS(n)-AC(60) with different PS tail lengths. The versatile and concentration-sensitive phase behaviors of these molecular shape amphiphiles are unique and have not been systematically explored in the traditional surfactants and block copolymers systems."

One C60 was tethered either to the end of a PS block (PEO-b-PS-C60) or at the junction point between PS and PEO blocks [PEO-(C60)-PS]; while multiple C60s could be attached randomly along the PS block (PEO-b-PS/C60). The reaction conditions were carefully controlled to ensure a quantitative C60 functionality at precise locations in the case of PEO-b-PS-C60 and PEO-(C60)-PS and to avoid crosslinking in the synthesis of PEO-b-PS/C60. The results have implications in the precision synthesis of fullerene polymers in general. These C60-containing diblock copolymers possess different composition, diverse architecture, and high fullerene functionality. They can serve as model “shape amphiphiles” for the construction of complex hierarchical structures via the interplay between C60–C60 aggregation and block copolymer self-assembly/micro-phase separation."

Advances in PSC performance have resulted mainly from the development of new low band gap (LBG)polymers. LBG polymers should have low optical band gaps to harvest photons from a broad spectrum of solar light. A second requirement is a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level that ensures exciton dissociation at the polymer/fullerene interface and a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level that affords high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and stability. Lastly, high carrier mobility is beneficial for efficient charge collection. It is important to develop new donor (D)- acceptor (A) type low band gap polymers for highly stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, we describe the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of two D-A type low band gap polymers. The polymer is quite flat, resulting in a highly crystalline film. In contrast, the polymer is highly twisted to yield an amorphous film. This work suggests that designing highly conjugated planar backboned polymers is crucial to improve not only the photovoltaic performance but also the stability of PSCs."
101,10.1155/2015/672654,2015.0,Synthesis and Preliminary Characterization of a PPE-Type Polymer Containing Substituted Fullerenes and Transition Metal Ligation Sites,A substituted fullerene was incorporated into a PPE-conjugated polymer repeat unit. This subunit was then polymerized via Sonogashira coupling with other repeat units to create polymeric systems approaching 50 repeat units (based on GPC characterization). Bipyridine ligands were incorporated into some of these repeat units to provide sites for transition metal coordination. Photophysical characterization of the absorption and emission properties of these systems shows excited states located on both the fullerene and aromatic backbone of the polymers that exist in a thermally controlled equilibrium. Future work will explore other substituted polyaromatic systems using similar methodologies.

It was found that the initiator afforded C60-end-capped polymers with well-controlled architecture, and the obtained polymer exhibited solvatochromism, indicating self-assembly in the media."
103,10.1002/chem.202100203,2021.0,"The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(η5‐P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization, Coordination Behavior and Encapsulation","Abstract The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(η5‐P5)] (1 b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high‐boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X‐ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards CuI halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(η5:1:1:1:1‐P5)}Cu2(μ‐X)2]n (2 a: X=Cl, 2 b: X=Br) and [{CpFe(η5:1:1‐P5)}Cu(μ‐I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo‐P5‐containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(η5:1:1‐P5)}Cu(μ‐I)]n (4).

Thereby, the formation of the CuI‐containing fullerene‐like sphere 5 c is found for the first time."
104,10.1002/aenm.202002095,2020.0,The Interplay of Stability between Donor and Acceptor Materials in a Fullerene‐Free Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cell Blend,"With rapid advances in material synthesis and device performance, the long‐term stability of organic solar cells has become the main remaining challenge toward commercialization. An investigation of photodegradation in blend films of the donor polymer poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the rhodanine‐flanked small molecule acceptor 5,5′‐[(9,9‐dioctyl‐9H‐fluorene‐2,7‐diyl)bis(2,1,3‐benzothiadiazole‐7,4‐diylmethylidyne)]bis[3‐ethyl‐2‐thioxo‐4‐thiazolidinone] (FBR) is presented in an ambient atmosphere. The photobleaching kinetics of the pure materials and their blends is correlated with the generation of radicals and triplet excitons using optical and magnetic resonance techniques. In addition, spin‐trapping methods are employed to identify reactive oxygen species (ROS). In films of P3HT, FBR, and the P3HT:FBR blend, superoxide is generated by electron transfer to molecular oxygen. However, it is found that the generation of singlet oxygen by energy transfer from the FBR triplet state is responsible for the poor stability of FBR and for the accelerated photodegradation at later times of the P3HT:FBR blend. In the early stage of degradation of the neat blend, it is protected from singlet oxygen by the fast donor–acceptor charge transfer, which competes with triplet exciton formation. These results provide initial input for a rational design of donor and acceptor materials through tuning the molecular singlet and triplet energy levels to prevent ROS‐related photodegradation."
105,10.1080/00914037.2013.845183,2014.0,Synthesis of Graft Copolymers and Their Preliminary Use as a Compatibilizer in Polymer Solar Cells,"Poly(p-xylylene)-graft-poly(butylacrylate-g-fullerene) or PPX-g-PBAFu was synthesized by using Wessling route and atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) techniques. The graft copolymers were used as a compatibilizer in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene (C60). The results from AFM micrographs showed that the phase size of P3HT and the aggregated C60 in the blended system was decreased from 300 to 30 nm after adding the copolymer (20 pph). Furthermore, the efficiencies of the BHJ cells from J-V curve were remarkably increased five times after adding the copolymer."
106,10.1039/d1nr01422f,2021.0,A high-voltage non-aqueous hybrid supercapacitor based on the N2200 polymer supported over multiwalled carbon nanotubes.,"P(NDI2OD-T2), also known as Polyera ActivInk N2200, is a widely accepted non-fullerene acceptor polymer that is used prominently in the energy harvesting application due to its ease of synthesis, high electron mobility, and other desirable semiconducting properties. With its recent foray into energy storage applications, there is tremendous potential for developing composites of N2200 with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to improve its electrical properties and extend its applicability. Here we report a facile synthesis of an N2200 composite with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) following an in situ approach to include MWCNTs into the polymer matrix, improving its electrochemical performance in an organic electrolyte (1 M LiClO4/propylene carbonate). The composite material with an optimum MWCNT content exhibits prominent redox behavior delivering a specific capacity of 80 mA h g-1(polymer) in a standard three-electrode cell. Moreover, the N2200/MWCNT composite material showing a battery-type electrochemical signature could perform as an efficient negative electrode in a high-voltage (2.4 V) hybrid supercapacitor device comprising capacitive activated carbon as the positive electrode."
107,10.1021/acsomega.1c01654,2021.0,Custom Synthesis of ZnO Nanowires for Efficient Ambient Air-Processed Solar Cells,"Nanostructuration of solar cells is an interesting approach to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE). This work aims at developing architectured 3D hybrid photovoltaic solar cells using ZnO nanowires (ZnONWs) as the electron transport layer (ETL) and nanocollectors of electrons within the active layer (AL). ZnONWs have been synthesized using a hydrothermal process with a meticulous control of the morphology. The AL of solar cells is elaborated using ZnONWs interpenetrated with a bulk heterojunction composed of donor (π-conjugate low band gap polymer: PBDD4T-2F)/acceptor (fullerene derivate: PC71BM) materials. An ideal interpenetrating ZnONW-D/A system with predefined specific morphological characteristics (length, diameter, and inter-ZnONW distances) was designed and successfully realized. The 3D architectures based on dense ZnONW arrays covered with conformal coatings of AL result in an increased amount of the ETL/AL interface, enhanced light absorption, and improved charge collection efficiency. For AL/ZnONW assembly, spin-coating at 100 °C was found to be the best. Other parameters were also optimized such as the D/A ratio and the pre/post-treatments achieving the optimal device with a D/A ratio of 1.25/1 and methanol treated on ZnONWs before and after the deposition of AL. A PCE of 7.7% (1.4 times better than that of the 2D cells) is achieved. The improvement of the performances with the 3D architecture results from both of: (i) the enhancement of the ZnO/AL surface interface (1 μm2/μm2 for the 2D structure to 6.6 μm2/μm2 for the 3D architecture), (ii) the presence of ZnONWs inside the AL, which behave as numerous nanocollectors (∼60 ZnONW/μm2) of electrons in the depth of the AL. This result validates the efficiency of the concept of nanotexturing of substrates, the method of solar cell assembly based on the nano-textured surface, the chosen morphological characteristics of the nanotexture, and the selected photoactive organic materials."
108,10.1039/C8TA04718A,2018.0,Nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors with perpendicular side-chains for fullerene-free solar cells,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) represent one of the potential candidates of next-generation solar cells for converting green and sustainable solar energy into electrical power. An OPV cell utilizes a blend of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) materials as photo-active layers, where photogenerated excitons are separated into mobile electrons and holes. Relative to fullerene acceptors, nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) have several advantages such as synthesis-facile chemical modifications and straightforward tunability in absorptivity, spectral coverage, optical band gap, and Frontier molecular orbitals. In the recent 3 years, progress in design and synthesis of fused-ring NF-SMAs with perpendicular side-chains on an electron-rich core, and again, on design and synthesis of wide/medium/low band gap polymer donors have led to realizations of over 13% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). These rapid advances require timely review articles. In this review article, we focus on this type of fused-ring NF-SMAs reported in the past 3 years, with special attention on their molecular structure design and structure–property relationships."
109,10.1021/la200885h,2011.0,Synthesis and self-assembly of stimuli-responsive poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate)-block-fullerene (PDMAEMA-b-C60) and the demicellization induced by free PDMAEMA chains.,"Well-defined poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate)-block-fullerene [60] ((PDMAEMA)-b-C(60)) with a galactose targeting moiety was prepared by atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). This copolymer was designed for possible use as a targeted drug carrier. The chemical composition and the self-assembly behavior were characterized using different techniques, including GPC, NMR, UV, and DLS. The self-assembly of the galactose-functionalized PDMAEMA-b-C(60) structure in aqueous solutions was investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS) under different pH conditions. At pH 3 and 10, the DLS results showed the presence of both polymeric micelles and unimers. However, a smaller R(h) was observed at pH 10 than at pH 3 because of electrostatic repulsion at low pH values. In addition, free PDMAEMA chains induced the demicellization of self-assembled nanostructures caused by the formation of a charge-transfer complex between PDMAEMA and C(60.) This phenomenon offers possible applications for free-polymer-triggered drug release."
110,10.1002/adfm.201802895,2018.0,A Highly Crystalline Fused‐Ring n‐Type Small Molecule for Non‐Fullerene Acceptor Based Organic Solar Cells and Field‐Effect Transistors,"N‐type organic small molecules (SMs) are attracting attention in the organic electronics field, due to their easy purification procedures with high yield. However, only a few reports show SMs that perform well in both organic field‐effect transistors (OFETs) and organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, the synthesis and characterization of an n‐type small molecule with an indacenodithieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (IDTT) core unit and linear alkylated side chain (C16) (IDTTIC) are reported. Compared to the state‐of‐the‐art n‐type molecule IDTIC, IDTTIC exhibits smaller optical bandgap and higher absorption coefficient, which is due to the enhanced intramolecular effect. After mixing with the polymer donor PBDB‐T, IDTIC‐based solar cells deliver a power conversion efficiency of only 5.67%. In stark contrast, the OSC performance of IDTTIC improves significantly to 11.2%. It is found that the superior photovoltaic properties of PBDB‐T:IDTTIC blends are mainly due to reduced trap‐assisted recombination and enhanced molecular packing coherence length and higher domain purity when compared to IDTIC. Moreover, a significantly higher electron mobility of 0.50 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDTTIC in OFET devices than for IDTIC (0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1) is obtained. These superior performances in OSCs and OFETs demonstrate that SMs with extended π‐conjugation of the backbone possess a great potential for application in organic electronic devices."
111,10.1021/ACSAEM.8B02020,2019.0,Negligible Energy Loss During Charge Generation in Small-Molecule/Fullerene Bulk-Heterojunction Solar Cells Leads to Open-Circuit Voltage over 1.10 V,"Solution-processable small molecules (SMs) that can serve as donors in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are practical alternatives to their polymer counterparts. However, SM–fullerene blends commonly suffer severe voltage losses. In general, devices that reach open-circuit voltages (VOC) > 1 V yield low photocurrents in BHJ solar cells with fullerene acceptors (e.g., PC71BM) and modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this contribution, we report on the design, synthesis, and BHJ device characteristics of a new SM donor, 2F-DRCN5T, yielding a VOC of up to 1.10 V with PC71BM as the fullerene acceptor, while maintaining PCEs > 7% (over 8% achieved upon solvent-vapor-annealing (SVA) treatment). The negligible energy loss during charge generation (ΔECT), the deep-lying HOMO of 2F-DRCN5T inferred from its large ionization potential (IP), the high charge-transfer-state energy (ECT) of the blend, and a reduced nonradiative voltage loss account for the high VOC achieved in BHJ solar cells."
112,10.1002/APP.33223,2011.0,Synthesis of functionalized fullerene-C60 by the living anionic polymerization technique,"The synthesis of functionalized fullerene-C 60 (C 60 ) was performed using living anionic polymerization. The metalation of the benzylic hydrogen atom on toluene or p-substituted toluene was conducted with the alkyllithium/amine system, and examined by living anionic polymerization of 1,3-cyclohexadiene. The number of carbanions bonded onto C 60 was estimated by the grafting reaction of living polymer onto C 60 . The tert-butyllithium/ N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine system was an effective metalation reagent, and toluene-, p-xylene-, 4-methyltriphenylamine-functionalized C 60 s having good solubility were successfully synthesized."

Two families of main‐chain polymer donors, based on fluorene or phenylene and donor–acceptor–donor comonomers in alternating copolymers, are used to absorb the high‐energy parts of the solar spectrum and to give high photovoltages in combinations with fullerene acceptors in devices.

114,10.1021/ar400136b,2014.0,Design and synthesis of molecular donors for solution-processed high-efficiency organic solar cells.,"Organic semiconductors incorporated into solar cells using a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) construction show promise as a cleaner answer to increasing energy needs throughout the world. Organic solar cells based on the BHJ architecture have steadily increased in their device performance over the past two decades, with power conversion efficiencies reaching 10%. Much of this success has come with conjugated polymer/fullerene combinations, where optimized polymer design strategies, synthetic protocols, device fabrication procedures, and characterization methods have provided significant advancements in the technology. More recently, chemists have been paying particular attention to well-defined molecular donor systems due to their ease of functionalization, amenability to standard organic purification and characterization methods, and reduced batch-to-batch variability compared to polymer counterparts. There are several critical properties for efficient small molecule donors. First, broad optical absorption needs to extend towards the near-IR region to achieve spectral overlap with the solar spectrum. Second, the low lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels need to be between -5.2 and -5.5 eV to ensure acceptable device open circuit voltages. Third, the structures need to be relatively planar to ensure close intermolecular contacts and high charge carrier mobilities. And last, the small molecule donors need to be sufficiently soluble in organic solvents (≥10 mg/mL) to facilitate solution deposition of thin films of appropriate uniformity and thickness. Ideally, these molecules should be constructed from cost-effective, sustainable building blocks using established, high yielding reactions in as few steps as possible. The structures should also be easy to functionalize to maximize tunability for desired properties. In this Account, we present a chronological description of our thought process and design strategies used in the development of highly efficient molecular donors that achieve power conversion efficiencies greater than 7%. The molecules are based on a modular D(1)-A-D(2)-A-D(1) architecture, where A is an asymmetric electron deficient heterocycle, which allowed us to quickly access a library of compounds and develop structure-property-performance relationships. Modifications to the D1 and D2 units enable spectral coverage throughout the entire visible region and control of HOMO energy levels, while adjustments to the pendant alkyl substituents dictate molecular solubility, thermal transition temperatures, and solid-state organizational tendencies. Additionally, we discuss regiochemical considerations that highlight how individual atom placements can significantly influence molecular and subsequently device characteristics. Our results demonstrate the utility of this architecture for generating promising materials to be integrated into organic photovoltaic devices, call attention to areas for improvement, and provide guiding principles to sustain the steady increases necessary to move this technology forward."
115,10.1021/MA100694Y,2010.0,Synthesis of Donor-Acceptor Multiblock Copolymers Incorporating Fullerene Backbone Repeat Units,"The synthesis of the first example of a block copolymer based on a polymer using fullerene as a backbone repeat subunit is demonstrated. A facile route incorporating the electron acceptor and high fullerene content polymer, poly{(1,4-fullerene)-alt-[1,4-dimethylene-2,5-bis(cyclohexylmethyl ether)phenylene]} (PFDP), with the archetypal electron donor, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), into a multiblock copolymer (MBC) structure is presented. α,ω-Bromomethyl-PFDP was prepared by atom-transfer radical addition polymerization (ATRAP) and then reacted with α,ω-phenol-P3HT via a Williamson condensation to yield the MBCs. The lengths of the electron-acceptor and donor polymer blocks could be selected so that the resulting solid state domains were of a size appropriate to organic solar cells. Also it was found that the MBCs gave a wide range of macro-structures, from micelles to well-defined wires, depending on the preparation conditions."
116,,2011.0,Synthesis and characterization of ethanol hydrogen sulfate ester fullerene,"This paper is aimed to discuss the synthesis and characterization of ethanol hydrogen sulfate ester fullerene in hoping to improve the performance of proton conductivity,methanol permeability, chemical stability and thermal stability of the polymer membrane.For the above purposes,we have prepared ethanol hydrogen sulfate ester fullerene by fuming sulfuric acid and fullerene alcohol.The above said ethanol hydrogen-sulfate ester fullerene was synthesized by C_(60), by using sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent. The samples we have taken were then characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and mass spectroscopy through elemental analysis.In addition,we have also analyzed the effects of reactant ratio,the reaction temperature and reaction time of the fullerene alcohol and the 20% fuming sulfuric acid.The results of our investigation show that as the raw material configuration becomes more and more complicated,the yield ratchets would rise up.When the weight ratio of the fullerene alcohol and the 20 % of fuming sulfuric acid were 1:11,the rate of production would be lowered,which indicated that it is the best synthesis conditions for the product 2.The yield of product 2 is sure to become greater as the temperature goes up,and eventually reaches its maximum at 25 ℃.Therefore,25 ℃ is the suitable reaction temperature for product 2,which is the product heavily affected by the reaction time.As the reaction time goes up,the yield of product 2 will increase and reach its maximum by 72 hours,beyond which the yield would drop down.Thus,72 hours can be taken as the desirable reaction time,at which point,the yield of product 2 should be made up to 52.2 % (which is calculated by the consumption of C_(60))."
117,10.1021/ACS.CHEMMATER.6B04287,2017.0,Propeller-Shaped Acceptors for High-Performance Non-Fullerene Solar Cells: Importance of the Rigidity of Molecular Geometry,"This paper describes the synthesis and application of βTPB6 and βTPB6-C as electron acceptors for organic solar cells. Compound βTPB6 contains four covalently bonded PDIs with a BDT-Th core at the β-position. The free rotation of PDIs renders βTPB6 with varying molecular geometries. The cyclization of βTPB6 yields βTPB6-C with high rigidity of the molecular geometry and enlarged conjugated skeleton. The inverted solar cells based on βTPB6-C and PTB7-Th as the donor polymer exhibited the highest efficiency of 7.69% with Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 14.9 mAcm–2, and FF of 0.56, which is 31% higher than that for βTPB6 based devices. The larger fraction of βTPB6-C and PTB7-Th than that of βTPB6:PTB7-Th in a blend film takes a face-on orientation packing pattern for π-systems that benefits the charge transport and hence higher PCE value than that for βTPB6:PTB7-Th. It was also found that a proper DIO:DPE additive further enhances this trend, which results in an increase of the PCE value for βTPB6-C:PTB7-Th while decr..."
118,10.1002/SOLR.201800053,2018.0,Synergistic Modifications of Side Chains and End Groups in Small Molecular Acceptors for High Efficient Non‐Fullerene Organic Solar Cells,"Two new acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) type non-fullerene acceptors, O-NTIC and O-NTNC, using hexacyclic naphthalene (cyclopentadithiophene) (NT) as the electron-donating unit, and dicycanovinylindan-1-one (INCN) or phenyl-fused dicycanovinylindan-1-one (NINCN) as the electron-deficient unit, respectively, are synthesized. From the perspective of synthesis easiness and cost, para-alkoxy-phenyl is used as side chains of the NT core. It is worth noting that the introduction of para-alkoxy-phenyl unit could tune the molecular energy levels and lift the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Compared with O-NTIC, the introduction of extended end-groups NINCN leads to a more ordered packing structure, much red-shifted absorption and enhanced electron mobility of O-NTNC. With polymer PBDB-T as the donor, the organic solar cell (OSC) devices obtain a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.1% for O-NTIC and much improved PCE of 11.0% for O-NTNC, respectively. Moreover, with a polythiophene derivative named PDCBT as the donor material, the PDCBT:O-NTNC based device exhibits a PCE of 10.0%, among the highest PCEs for PDCBT devices. These results indicate that O-NTNC has great potential on the application for high performance and low-cost OSCs, and the extended end group NINCN as well as para-alkoxyphenyl side chain substituted core could be promising units for the design of materials with high performance."
119,10.1039/C6TA09607G,2017.0,Small molecule carbazole-based diketopyrrolopyrroles with tetracyanobutadiene acceptor unit as a non-fullerene acceptor for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells,"Herein, we investigated the photovoltaic properties of carbazole-based diketopyrrolopyrroles with tetracyanobutadiene acceptor units as highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors together with a D–A conjugated polymer, P, as a donor for polymer solar cells. After optimization, i.e. donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapour annealing, the polymer solar cells exhibited power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.86% and 7.19% for DPP7 and DPP8 as acceptors, respectively. These results indicate that slight changes in the chemical structure of the small acceptor molecule significantly increase the efficiency of the device. The design and synthesis of these non-fullerene acceptors with broader absorption spectra extended towards the near infrared region may be key for the further development of high-performance and cost-effective solution-processed organic solar cells."
120,10.1002/CPLU.201300045,2013.0,Synthesis of Clickable Water‐Soluble Poly(amidoamine) Fullerodendrimers and Their Use for Surface Functionalization of Azido‐Coated Polymer Nanoparticles,"In this study, the synthesis of water-soluble fullerene derivatives bearing on one side a poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendron with peripheral carboxylic groups and an alkyne moiety on the other side is presented. Fullerodendrimers with tert-butyl ester groups at the periphery were first prepared by treating C60 with unsymmetrical malonates through the use of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)/I2 or DBU/CBr4 conditions. The latter led to an unexpected addition of dibromocarbene on C60. The tert-butyl esters were then cleaved using formic acid and gave the corresponding carboxyfullerene derivatives. The second generation with eight carboxylic groups at the periphery was easily dissolved in water, whereas the first generation with its four carboxylic groups can only be solubilized in a basic medium. These compounds self-assemble into micelle-like aggregates probably composed of a cluster of C60 surrounded by a PAMAM shell. The alkyne moiety was then used as a chemical anchor to immobilize in water fullerodendrimers on the surface of azido-coated polymer nanoparticles by means of the copper(I)-catalyzed azide and alkyne cycloaddition reaction. At room temperature, this reaction is competing with azido cycloaddition onto the fullerene core. Given the high density of azide anchoring groups on the nanoparticle surface and the size of the fullerodendrimers, unreacted azides are still active and are available for subsequent functional arrangements. This strategy paves the way for the design of functional fullerene-rich nanomaterials that could be of interest in the field of materials science."
121,10.1021/MA900312A,2009.0,"Synthesis, Optical Properties, and Microstructure of a Fullerene-Terminated Poly(3-hexylthiophene)","End-functionalized, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was synthesized by a combination of a controlled polymerization technique and postpolymerization functionalization. Both ends of the polymer chains were terminated with fullerene units to create an internal electron accepting−donating−accepting molecule, methylfulleropyrrolidine−poly(3-hexylthiophene)−methylfulleropyrrolidine (C60-P3HT-C60). The molecular properties of the polymer were characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), ultraviolet−visible (UV−vis) absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. These results show that the fullerene units are covalently bound to the polymer chain ends. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were used to determine the bulk microstructure of the polymers. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine spun-cast thin films. These experiments revealed that microphase sepa..."
122,10.1021/acsami.9b22933,2020.0,Composite Interlayer Consisting of Alcohol-Soluble Polyfluorene and Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells.,"We report the synthesis of composite interlayers using alcohol-soluble polyfluorene (ASP)-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and their application as electron transport layers for efficient organic solar cells. The ASP enables the individual dispersion of SWNTs in solution. The ASP-wrapped SWNT solutions are stable for 54 days without any aggregation or precipitation, indicating their very high dispersion stability. Using the ASP-wrapped SWNTs as a cathode interlayer on zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), a power conversion efficiency of 9.45% is obtained in PTB7-th:PC71BM-based organic solar cells, which is mainly attributed to the improvement in the short circuit current. Performance enhancements of 18% and 17% are achieved compared to those of pure ZnO NPs and ASP on ZnO NPs, respectively. In addition, the composite interlayer is applied to non-fullerene-based photovoltaics with PM6:Y6, resulting in the PCE up to 14.37%. The type of SWNT (e.g., in terms of diameter range and length) is not critical to the improvement in the charge-transport properties. A low density of SWNTs in the film (~1 SWNTs/μm2 for ASP-wrapped SWNTs) has a significant influence on the charge transport in solar cells. The improvement in the performance of the solar cell is attributed to the increased internal quantum efficiency, balanced mobility between electrons and holes, and minimized charge recombination."

124,10.1002/APP.31468,2010.0,Synthesis of graft copolymers based on polyphenylene xylylene and fullerene grafted polystyrene,"Graft copolymers containing poly(pheny- lene xylyene) (PPX) backbone and polystyrene fullerene (PSFu) grafting chains (PPX-g-PSFu) were prepared by using a purposed synthetic route comprising a combination of reaction mechanisms namely the modified Wessling route, an iniferter polymerization, and an atom transfer rad- ical addition (ATRA). The monomer was first prepared by reacting dichloroxylene with tetrahydrothiophene. After that the monomer was polymerized in a sodium hydroxide solution to provide a polymer precursor. Subsequently, the polymer precursor was modified by reacting it with a dithiocarbamate (DTC) compound. The macroiniferter was obtained and then copolymerized with styrene and chloro- methylstyrene via an iniferter polymerization. Finally, the graft copolymer was reacted with fullerene through an ATRA technique to attach the C60 groups onto the graft copolymer molecule. The products obtained from each of the steps were characterized by using various techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, UV- visible spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The aforementioned results suggest that the graft copolymers were prepared. The grafting yield and grafting efficiency were found to increase with the monomers concentration and the amount of DTC used. Some homopolymer contami- nants also occurred but those could be minimized and sub- sequently removed by extraction with selective solvents. These graft copolymer products might be used for the de- velopment of a bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell. V C 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 116: 433-440, 2010"

In this work, we report the results on some composites of the conjugated polymer MEH-PPV (poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) and P3HT (poly-3-hexylthiophen) with [60]fullerene and metal phthalocyanines. We have measured the polymer photoluminescence quenching in the composites in order to evaluate the ability of our compounds as the acceptors in the process of photoinduced electron transfer. We have also studied the photovoltaic properties of the composites. We have found that adding of phthalocyanine to fullerene may lead to an increase in the acceptor ability and in the higher photovoltaic efficiency of the composite at the same fullerene contents."

To further improve the device performance of OSCs, it is highly desired to develop suitable donor polymers which feature complementary absorption and favorable energy levels to match the non-fullerene acceptors. We report here the synthesis of two phthalimide-based wide bandgap polymers TPhI-BDT and TffPhI-DBT. The TffPhI-BDT is based on a new electron acceptor unit, difluorophthalimide (ffPhI). The fluorine addition leads to TffPhI-DBT with comparable absorption but lower-lying frontier molecular orbitals versus the non-fluorinated analogue TPhI-BDT. When incorporated into non-fullerene OSCs, polymer TPhI-BDT shows a PCE of 8.31% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 14.07 mA cm–2, and a FF of 66.0%.

However, the selection of limited dopants confines its successful application. Inspired by the Lewis base characteristics of the photovoltaic materials, the Lewis acid as novel dopant is introduced in organic solar cells. In both fullerene and nonfullerene based blends, Lewis acid doping leads to increased photovoltaic performance. Detailed experiments reveal that Lewis acid doping has a synergistic effect on modifying the polymer's electronic properties and the acceptor's nanostructure even at low doping concentration, and these are simultaneously responsible for the device improvements. Based on the mechanism studies, it is proposed that the Lewis acid‐doped polymers anions produce induced dipole on the acceptor, this increases the intermolecular interaction and facilitates the morphology optimization. It is believed that the synergistic effect by Lewis acid doping greatly expands the application of doped organic solar cells, in concert with other existing methods to yield higher efficiency values."

The strategy employed required that first a suitably derivatised mono-fulleropyrrolidine was prepared and characterised which was then subsequently reacted with an acryloyl chloride functionalised polymer. The amino group of the fulleropyrrolidine reacts with the acyl chloride functional groups of the polymer forming an amide bond. This approach enabled the preparation of several soluble fullerene/acrylic polymers with a controlled and high covalently bonded fullerene content. The resulting fullerene derivatised methacrylate polymers were characterised by UV, infrared and gel permeation chromatography."

However, the efficiency of OSCs achieved so far is not up to the mark. Major components of OSCs are the electron acceptor material, such as fullerene, and the electron donor material, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT. Fullerene is an ideal acceptor material but molecular level engineering of P3HT is required to enhance the efficiency of OSCs. Optoelectronic properties of P3HT can be improved by controlling the regioregularity, energy band gap, and molar mass of the polymer. Additionally, p-doping of the semiconducting polymer can also help in broadening the optical spectrum of P3HT. In this study, we propose methods for the improvement of the above-mentioned properties during the synthesis of P3HT. The main focus was the improvement of the regioregularity of the synthesized P3HT, which was achieved by polymerization of 3-hexylthiophene under an electric field for the first time. The effect of molar mass and p-doping on the band gap is evaluated systematically and theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental results."

Incorporation of the C60 moieties in the polymer was established by IR, NMR, and UV−vis spectroscopy. The solution UV−vis spectra of these C60-containing copolymers appear to be dominated by scattering, obscuring specific electronic excitation features associated with the fullerene. UV−vis spectral analysis of filtrate fractions collected using filters of varying pore sizes indicates that polymers form microgels with polydisperse particle sizes (micron to submicron dimensions) in solution that extensively scatter at shorter wavelengths. Differences in the fluorescence properties of the filtered fractions and unfiltered samples were observed. Furthermore, fluorescence emission spectra of a copolymer showed wavelength-dependent behavior.

137,10.3389/fchem.2020.00350,2020.0,Propeller-Like All-Fused Perylene Diimide Based Electron Acceptors With Chalcogen Linkage for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells,"Perylene diimide (PDI) is a widely explored chromophore for constructing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The advantage of using PDI derivatives lies in the readily availability of PDI unit which largely reduces the synthesis cost and improves material stability. Indeed, the recent development of high performance NFAs shed light on the feasibility of the commercialization, but the complex synthesis and poor stability of the top performing NFAs cast a shadow on this bright future. Our previous work has demonstrated a propeller-like structure with three PDIs lined to a benzene center core with a C-C bond which prevented the PDIs to aggregate into undesired large crystals. In this work, we designed and synthesized three new propeller-like PDI derivatives with extra chalcogen linkages between the PDIs and the center core to form all-fused rigid structures. These molecules showed more suitable absorption range than that of their unfused counterparts when blend with donor polymer PTB7-Th. Comparing between the molecules with extra oxygen, sulfur or selenium linkages, the sulfur-based BTT-PDI outperformed the others due to its higher photon absorption and charge transport abilities. This work demonstrated the great potential of PDI derivatives for PSC applications and explored the influences of linkage type on the fused PDI derivatives, which provided a useful tuning knob for molecular design of PDI-based NFAs in the future."

Thin films of TAZC60 exhibit an electron mobility of 2.2 × 10-8 m2/V s, as determined from the current−voltage characteristics that fit with a space-charge limited current (SCLC). These properties are similar to those of [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM, a soluble fullerene widely used in organic photovoltaics.

Compared with conventional heating process, MI could significantly enhance the rate of the fullerenation under identical reaction conditions. The C60 content of the fullerene-functionalized polycarbonate (C60-PC) could be controlled via varying the C60/PC feed ratio and the reaction time. The C60-PCs are soluble in common organic solvents such as THF and chloroform. The products were characterized by gel permeation chromatography, UV–vis, FTIR, TGA, DSC, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR. The reaction of C60 with PC under MI was monitored by electron spin resonance spectra, the fullerene radicals were detected in reaction solutions and also in the solid product polymers, indicating the radical mechanism of the reaction. The nonlinear optical property of C60-PCs in THF was investigated by the open-aperture z-scan technique at 527 nm, and its nonlinear absorption coefficient was found to be in the same order as that of C60.

For the chemical structure, SA has enough lone electron pairs of oxygen atoms in the backbone and short branched chains, which is expected to passivate oxygen vacancy on the surface of the ZnO cathode buffer layer to improve the photovoltaic performance. Herein, it was applied to modify the surface trap of the ZnO layer in fullerene and non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). The defects were successfully reduced, and the trap-assisted recombination decreased. In a PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved from 8.06% to 9.36%. In the PM6:IT-4F system, PCE was enhanced from 12.13% to 13.08%. The addition of SA did not destroy the stability of the device.

[70]PCBM, in this case a mixt. of isomeric [6,6]-phenyl- C71- butyric acid Me esters, is the higher fullerene analog of [60]PCBM, and displays improved light absorption in the visible region. Consequently, when this material is used in a photovoltaic cell instead of [60]PCBM, 50 % higher current densities are obtained. The synthesis of [70]PCBM was performed and the monoadduct fraction was isolated from the higher adducts and unreacted C70 by column chromatog. 1H and 13C NMR were performed on the [70]PCBM, as was UV/VIS absorption in toluene soln. Spin-coated composite films were made with MDMO-PPV, and photoinduced absorption measurements give direct spectral evidence for photoinduced charge sepn., not only upon excitation of the polymer, but also after selective excitation of [70]PCBM at 630 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements ater excitation at 488 mn, obsd. at 570 nm indicate near quant. charge generation upon polymer excitation, but at 720 nm this quenching depends on the processing solvent, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, vs. o-xylene.

The monomers were later copolymerized with t-butyl methacrylate. In the case of anionic copolymerization using a Grignard reagent, the monomers were incorporated in the polymer chain via vinyl chain reactions, resulting in a charm bracelet type fullerene polymer. The copolymer composition was found almost equal to the composition of monomers fed. In radical copolymerizations, low molecular weight oligomers were obtained in low yields, and contained almost equal amounts of the vinyl group to the fullerene monomer incorporated in the polymer, indicating that the fullerene unit played a role of an inhibitor or a degradative chain transfer agent."

The thermal conversion of the nanodiamond phase to a multilayer fullerene phase was carefully investigated by integral and local characterization methods such as vibrational spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, BET, SEM and HRTEM. The incorporation of nanodiamonds in a silica matrix enhances the crystallization temperature of the silica phase, as α-cristobalite, to 1500 °C, while their full graphitization is shifted to T > 1700 °C under an argon atmosphere. The thermal decomposition of the nanodiamond/silica composites leads to the formation of materials with a high specific surface area (up to 562 m2 g-1) and a mesoporous structure. No carbothermal reaction of composing phases was identified. The results obtained in the present study allow for designing advanced and highly-defined mesoporous 0D-nanocarbon-containing composites with tailored structural features and multifunctional property profiles."

Increasing Voc requires fullerene acceptors with higher LUMOs than PCBM. To date, most fullerene derivatives synthesized for this purpose either do not achieve the high photocurrent afforded by PCBM or show relatively poor compatibility with the next-generation low bandgap conjugated polymers used in high-efficiency organic solar cells. Here, we report the facile synthesis of methoxylated 1,4-bisbenzyl fullerene adducts and their application as efficient electron acceptors in conjugated polymer-based solar cells. The methoxy groups are found to be essential to increasing the LUMO levels, and accordingly the Voc, of the devices compared to the parent 1,4-bisbenzyl fullerene, and more importantly, to PCBM. The best fullerene 1,4-bisadduct provides a ∼20% enhancement in power conversion efficiency over PCBM when used with the classic crystalline polymer P3HT. When used in combination with a higher-performance low bandgap polymer, PTB7, the bisadduct both increases the device open-circuit voltage and maintains the high photocurrent provided by the more traditional PCBM. We also examine 10 different 1,4-fullerene bisadducts and show that the photovoltaic device performance is strongly influenced by the number and relative position of the methoxy substituents on the benzyl addends: moving a single methoxy substituent by one position on the benzyl rings can change the device efficiency by over a factor of 2."

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of blends with different compositions revealed that no eutectic composition existed for the blends, in contrast to previously reported P3HT/non-fullerene acceptor combinations. Analysis of the DSC data shows that the thermal properties of the P3HT and the dimeric non-fullerene acceptor are almost independent of blend composition. However, the thermal properties of blends containing the monomeric acceptor were found to depend strongly on the blend composition, with increasing concentrations of the monomeric acceptor depressing the observed melting point of the polymer. These results are complemented by specular X-ray diffraction data, which reveals stark differences in the crystallinity of the two blend systems. In the case of the di..."

When the dipole moment and polarizability of the acceptor polymer are compared, it is observed that when the dipole moment decreases, the polarizability becomes larger. The polarizability of polymers containing PDI is significantly greater than those containing NDI, and their polarizability change is in accordance with the change in the transient fluorescence lifetime. It was also found that the power conversion efficiency of the non-fullerene solar cell was strongly correlated to polarizability. The results demonstrate that the polarizability can be utilized to screen novel donor and acceptor polymers for the design and synthesis of high-performance solar cells."

Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of monodisperse PBTTT oligothiophenes (n = 1-5) and systematically examine the evolution of crystalline behavior, morphology, and interaction with [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the molecular conjugation length increases. We discovered that fullerene intercalation occurs when there is enough free volume between the side chains to accommodate the fullerene molecule. The intercalation of PCBM is observed beyond BTTT-2 and longer oligomers, likely similar to that of PBTTT. Interestingly, both experiments and molecular simulations show that PCBM intercalation also appears to ""catalyze"" a more efficient packing of the BTTT-2 dimers. Crystal structure analysis revealed that the straight BTTT-2 side chains form one-dimensional (1D) channels that could perfectly host PCBM but, in the pure material, accommodate the interdigitated side chains from adjacent layers. In the blend with PCBM, these channels are maintained and enable the cocrystallization and intercalation of PCBM. This is the first time the actual sublattice cell of PCBM has been determined from the X-ray data, and demonstration the utility of the oligomers as model systems for their polymer counterparts. Among the organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) made from the BTTT oligomers and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blends, the ones containing the BTTT-2 dimer exhibit the highest performance."

Many different kinds of fullerene functionalized polymers have been prepared. In the letter, we prepared C 60 and phenylacetylene copolymers with C 60 content of 4.6 wt% and 9.6 wt% using organic metallic catalyst. Their structure were characterized using GPC, FTIR, NMR and UV spectrometer, respectively. The copolymers effectively limit strong 532-nm laser pulses. A new blue fluorescence with an emission peak wavelength at ca. 470 nm in the copolymers was found when the copolymers were excited at the wavelength of ca. 400 nm and its intensity increases with more C 60 in the copolymers."
154,,2005.0,Synthesis of C_(60) Fullerene Derivatives by Azide Alkyl Cyclo-addition and Their Optoelectronic Performance,"A series of imino C_~60 fullerene derivatives was synthesized through the cycloaddition reaction between C_~60 and a long chain alkyl azide. The electrochemical properties and UV-Vis absorption spectra of these compounds were investigated. Polymer photovoltaic cells with these imino C_~60 fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor and MEH-PPV as the electron donor were fabricated and their performance was studied. The solubility in organic solvents and compatibility of these derivatives with conjugated polymer electron donor phase increases with the increasing of the length and number of alkyl linked to C_~60 fullerene core. The energy conversion efficiency(ECE) and the short circuit current(I_~sc ) also increase in the same sequence. The maximum short circuit current density(I_~sc ) reached 1.77 mA/cm2, close to that of the device fabricated from PCBM. Extremely high photo to dark current ratio makes these devices a good candidate for sensor application."

The polymerization of acrylonitrile in DMF initiated by the growing chains of poly(acrylonitrile) was studied, and prerequisites for the preservation of the living end groups of the polymer were determined. It was shown that, in the synthesis of fullerene-containing polymers, C 60 fullerene only reacts with the growing macromolecules of poly(acrylonitrile). The initial initiator, lithium tert-butoxide, which was not consumed in polymerization was found to be uninvolved in the reactions under study.

Utilizing the new method, C70-C-C70, C60-C-C70, C60-C-C60, and C70-O-C70 were prepared and characterized. The method is capable of synthesizing new C2m-X-C2n molecules by introducing X (different atoms) into the reaction system. Energetic radiation created reactive sites for covalently bonded bridges between fullerene molecules originally only weakly bound by van der Waals force. This observation may open a new subject and practicable approach for polymer sciences of fullerenes."

UV-Visible spectrum shows a characteristic broad absorption band observed near 470 nm suggesting presence of cuprous oxide NPs in the NFs. The shift in the vibrational band of –OH group of PVA in the presence of metal oxide NPs reveals chemical interaction between –OH group of PVA and NPs. XRD study suggests the occurrence of Cu2O NPs in the PNC film and NPs are crystalline in nature. SEM image shows the presence of agglomerated NPs in a polymer matrix.

Here, we designed and synthesized a naphthobispyrazine derivative bearing four ester groups (eNPz) as a new electron-deficient building unit and three eNPz-based semiconducting polymers with different donor units, that is, bithiophene (PeNPz2T), terthiophene (PeNPz3T), and quaterthiophene (PeNPz4T). These new polymers have relatively deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of around −3.5 eV, along with narrow optical band gaps of around 1.5 eV. The LUMO energy levels and the optical band gaps are significantly deeper and narrower than those of a polymer based on alkylated naphthobispyrazine.

The polymers showed good solubility, broad absorption bands and optical band gaps of 1.62 eV and 1.16 eV for P1 and P2, respectively. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells based on P1 and P2 as electron donors and fullerene derivatives (PC60BM and PC70BM) as acceptor were fabricated and their photovoltaic response was investigated. The overall power conversion efficieny (PCE) achieved for BHJ solar cells based on P1:PC60BM, P2:PC60BM, P1:PC70BM and P2:PC70BM blends cast from THF solvent is about 2.17%, 0.80%, 3.45% and 1.19%, respectively. The higher PCE for the device based on P1 has been attributed to the high value of hole mobility for P1 as compared to P2 and a larger driving force i.e. LUMO–LUMO offset, for photo-induced charge transfer for P1:PCBM BHJ active layer. The PCE has been further increased up to 5.30% and 1.58% for P1:PC70BM and P2:PC70BM blends cast from DIO/THF solvent, which is attributed to the improved crystallinity and a more balanced charge transport in the device."

In this work, we synthesized a novel n-type porphyrin acceptor, PZn-TNI, via the introduction of the electron withdrawing naphthalene imide (NI) moiety at the meso position of zinc porphyrin (PZn). PZn-TNI has excellent thermal stability and unique bimodal absorption with a strong Soret band (300–600 nm) and weak Q-band (600–800 nm). The weak long-wavelength absorption of PZn-TNI was completely covered by combining the low bandgap polymer donor, PTB7-Th, which realized the well-balanced panchromatic photon-to-current conversion in the range of 300–800 nm. Notably, the one-step reaction of the NI moiety from a commercially available source leads to the cheap and simple n-type porphyrin synthesis. The substitution of four NIs in PZn ring induced sufficient n-type characteristics with proper HOMO and LUMO energy levels for efficient charge transport with PTB7-Th. Fullerene-free organic solar cells based-on PTB7-Th:PZn-TNI were investigated and showed a promising PCE of 5.07% without any additive treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE in the porphyrin-based acceptors without utilization of the perylene diimide accepting unit."

In the search for carbon-based catalysts for ORRs, two different classes of new fullerene hybrids and metal-free fullerene derivatives endowed with suitable active sites have been prepared by highly selective metal- and organo-catalyzed synthetic methodologies. Along with their classical behavior as electron acceptors in polymer-based photo-electrochemical cells, the new fullerene derivatives are able to efficiently catalyze ORRs by using no metals or very low amounts of metals. Remarkably, the activity of metal-free fullerenes has proved to be as high as that observed for metallofullerenes bearing noble metals, and up to ten-fold higher than that of PCBM."

However, the state-of-the-art conjugated polymers for PSCs are based on the complex molecular structure that requires several steps for synthesis and purification, which impedes low materials cost for the PSCs. Thus, it is a key challenge to develop high-performance conjugated polymers with easily accessible building blocks for applications in practical PSCs. Here, a novel low band gap polymer (PFBTBOX) which comprises readily available building blocks was designed and synthesized to be used as an electron donor for PSCs. Affirmative optoelectronic properties of PFBTBOX for photovoltaic applications resulted in high PCEs up to 10.20 and 8.11% with nonfullerene and fullerene acceptors, respectively. Moreover, PFBTBOX exhibited minimal energy loss as low as 0.55 eV with a nonfullerene acceptor, indicating that PFBTBOX is a promising electron donor polymer for practical PSCs with high efficiency exceeding 10%."

The concentration of C60 in the C60–PDAS/PDAS blends strongly affected the hole and electron drift mobility values; the hole drift mobility decreased with an increase in the C60 concentration. However, the electron drift mobility increased with an increase in the C60 concentration. The hole and electron drift mobility values were almost the same for the 1/2 C60–PDAS/PDAS blend; therefore, this polymer blend was thought to be a bipolar polymer semiconductor. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PBTZF4:bPDI2P solar cells exhibit a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.118 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.02 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 49.5%, affording a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.55%.

Both PBTZF4:bPDI2P and PBTZF2:bPDI2P cells benefit from complementary (donor/acceptor) light absorption and very low geminate recombination, with bimolecular recombination being the dominant loss mechanism, as established by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. DFT computation and physicochemical characterization data argue that the “additional” tetrafluorination planarizes the PBTZF4 backbone and enhances aggregation versusPBTZF2, affording superior charge carrier transport as assayed by field-effect mobility. In addition, fluorine-originated HOMO stabilization, −5.41 eV for PBTZF4versus −5.33 eV for PBTZF2, and a superior blend microstructure afford a higher PBTZF4:bPDI2P solar cell PCE versusPBTZF2:bPDI2P."

Herein, we report the precise synthesis of two multifunctional bismacrocycles [n]CPP-P[5]A by integrating P[5]A into the [n]CPP backbone. The photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦF) of the bismacrocycles was found to show a dramatic increase relative to the corresponding [n]CPPs. The chiral enantiomers (pR)/(pS)-[8]CPP-P[5]A were successfully isolated by chiral HPLC, and showed promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum ~ 0.02). In addition, [n]CPP-P[5]A bismacrocycles are capable of binding pyridinium salts and fullerene derivatives with high affinity and specificity within the two distinct cavities.

A biocompatible triblock poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-polyethylene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine), P4VP8-b-PEO105-b-P4VP8, was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization. The block copolymer formed complexes with C60 in toluene and resulted in fullerene assembly in cluster form. Nanocomposite dispersion in an aqueous solution could be obtained using an aged solution of the polymer/C60/toluene solution by a solvent evaporation technique. The UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the complex formation of fullerene with the polymer which plays a significant role in controlling the PDI and size of polymer/C60 micelles in the toluene solution. The particle size and morphology of P4VP8-b-PEO105-b-P4VP8 and P4VP8-b-PEO105-b-P4VP8/C60 mixture were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Incorporating the electron-deficient DG-TDPP moieties within the polymer backbone and appending the tTPA units promoted charge balance and efficient conjugation within the extended conjugated frameworks of the polymers, resulting in lower band gap energies and red-shifting the maximum UV-Vis absorption wavelength. The influence of the DG-TDPP content on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic (PV) properties of the polymers has been studied. Incorporating a suitable content of DG-TDPP moieties in the polymer backbone enhanced the solar absorption ability and conjugation length of the PTs.

173,10.1002/aenm.202104050,2022.0,The Renaissance of Oligothiophene‐Based Donor–Acceptor Polymers in Organic Solar Cells,"The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have increased rapidly owing to the development of non‐fullerene acceptors (NFAs). However, the development of polymer donors lags behind significantly. Currently, the polymer donors are dominated by a handful of thiophene‐substituted benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b']dithiophene (BDTT) polymers, which suffer from lengthy synthesis and high production cost. Compared with BDTT‐based polymers, oligothiophene‐based donor‐acceptor polymers feature much easier synthesis, which were the prevailing polymer donors in fullerene‐based OSCs, but almost disappeared in non‐fullerene OSCs. Herein, two oligothiophene‐based donor‐acceptor polymers (PTTz‐3HD and PTTz‐4HD) are reported to re‐evaluate this kind of polymer in non‐fullerene OSCs. Benefiting from the exquisite alkyl chain design, the polymer PTTz‐3HD exhibits more planar conformation, stronger aggregation, and higher crystallinity, which in turn contributes to the formation of an optimal active layer morphology when blended with NFA. As a result, a PCE of 16.1% and 16.7% is achieved by PTTz‐3HD in binary and ternary OSCs, respectively. Of particular note, the product of short‐circuit current density and fill factor of PTTz‐3HD is fully comparable to those of BDTT‐based polymers. These results suggest the renaissance of oligothiophene‐based donor‐acceptor polymers in OSCs and demonstrate a promising avenue to access high‐efficiency OSCs from low‐cost materials."

All the polymers have good thermal stability, solubility and broad absorption spectra. Their photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic (PV) properties were investigated. To understand their different PV performance in the resulting polymer solar cells (PSCs), the morphology of their blends with fullerene derivatives was investigated by atomic force microscopy, and the molecular geometries as well as the molecular frontier orbitals were simulated by density functional theory calculations (Gaussian 09). The polymer PBDT-TIT, with BDT flanked by thiophenes as the donor unit and isoindigo as the acceptor unit, exhibits quite planar backbones and its blend with fullerene derivatives shows optimal morphology. As a result, the PSCs based on PBDT-TIT with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-TIT:PC61BM/LiF/Al showed a power conversion efficiency of 4.22%, with a short-circuit current density of 7.87 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V and a fill factor of 0.68 under the AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator."

Nevertheless, the low LUMO energy level and weak absorption in visible region are its two weak points. For enhancing the solar light harvest, the soluble C70 derivative PC70BM has been used as acceptor instead of PC60BM in high efficiency PSCs in recent years. But, the LUMO level of PC70BM is the same as that of PC60BM, which is too low for the PSCs based on the polymer donors with higher HOMO level, such as poly (3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Here, a new soluble C70 derivative, indene‐C70 bisadduct (IC70BA), is synthesized with high yield of 58% by a one‐pot reaction of indene and C70 at 180 °C for 72 h. The electrochemical properties and electronic energy levels of the fullerene derivatives are measured by cyclic voltammetry. The LUMO energy level of IC70BA is 0.19 eV higher than that of PC70BM. The PSC based on P3HT with IC70BA as acceptor shows a higher Voc of 0.84 V and higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.64%, while the PSC based on P3HT/PC60BM and P3HT/PC70BM displays Voc of 0.59 V and 0.58 V, and PCE of 3.55% and 3.96%, respectively, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The results indicate that IC70BA is an excellent acceptor for the P3HT‐based PSCs and could be a promising new acceptor instead of PC70BM for the high performance PSCs based on narrow bandgap conjugated polymer donor."
176,,2018.0,1LE-7 : Molecular Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors for Electronics and Photonics,"There has been tremendous progress in the synthesis and development of π-conjugated polymer semiconductors for diverse applications in electronics and photonics in the last two decades. Advances in the synthesis of diverse p-type polymers have enabled the development of high-performance organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) as well as more efficient fullerene-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In con-trast, n-type polymer semiconductors remain relatively scarce and the performance of n-channel OFETs has consequently lagged significantly behind those of p-channel OFETs. Similarly, the performance of all-polymer (polymer/polymer bulk heterojunction) solar cells has lagged far behind those of fullerene-based OPVs. Thus, the develop-ment of suitable n-type polymer semiconductors is of great interest in the fields of organic electronics and OPVs."

The dimethacrylate enriched macromolecules migrate to toluene and the VP units enriched copolymer chains remain in water to form copolymer micelles and their aggregates in these media that solubilize and encapsulate the fullerene. The structure and properties of obtained polymer composites were studied by GPC with dual detection (RI and MALLS), FT-IR, WAXS and SAXS methods. It is shown that in a composite based on N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer isolated from toluene the fullerene form larger particles, compare to that isolated from water. According to SAXS, the fullerene particles in a solid copolymer are organized in spherical objects with fine coil-like structure. The stability of the composites in water, ethanol, and chloroform was shown to depend on the original polymer matrix structure and on copolymer/fullerene ratio. POLYM. COMPOS., 35:1362–1371, 2014.

178,,2014.0,Application of Silylmethyl Fullerene Derivatives in Small Molecule Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells for High Open-Circuit Voltage,"Small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) are currently increasing in efficiency at a much greater rate than their polymer counterparts, with efficiencies now ∼8%. These advances in performance originate from the recent advances in donor molecule design and synthesis, with almost no focus yet directed towards improving the fullerene acceptor, which in previous examples has always been PCBM. Recent results in polymer:fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs), more precisely, P3HT:fullerene devices, has shown that by lowering the LUMO level of the fullerene acceptor higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) can be acheved that allows significant improvements in device efficiency to be obtained. However, applying the same fullerene acceptors to low-bandgap polymer donors leads to a decrease in performance due to a significant decrease in photocurrent that negates the improved VOC. This decrease in photocurrent does not occur in the case of P3HT and has been shown to stem from thermodynamic limitations and/or active layer morphology. It has yet to be seen whether small molecule donors follow the same pattern as that of polymers. For this reason we chose to study alternative fullerene acceptors to PCBM in order to a) better understand the key limiting factors of OSCs in general and b) further improve the efficiency of of SMOSCs."

Once formed these highly reactive particles are capable to start number of chain reactions damaging living tissues and are believed to be a reason for some kinds of cancer. It is thus important to capture and study free radicals in live biological tissues and samples, which is complicated due to the short‐lived life span of free radicals. Mostly indirect methods focus on studying tissues affected by free radicals instead of direct observation and trapping of the latter. Here we present a method for the synthesis of biocompatible polymers based on polycyclic esters, in which fullerene C60, is chemically linked to the polymeric matrix. Fullerene is biocompatible and also known as a good radical scavenger capable to trap multiple small radicals from solutions. In such a way, radical trapping from living tissues and blood can happen on the surface of a biocompatible polymer which is in contact with physiological sample (for example as a filter built‐in into infusion device) allowing in‐vivo studying of free radical effects. In this project we first use the Diels‐Alder reaction to connect C60 to amino‐anthracene. Next we use the Schiff‐base or reductive amination reactions of carbonyl groups of poly‐cyclic esters with primary amines in order to link the fullerene radical trap to the polymeric matrix. Like pure fullerene C60 this biocompatible polymeric hook for free radicals may be used in tissues and physiological liquids in in‐vivo experiments. The synthesis, product isolation and characterization and preliminary trapping experiments will be presented."

The effect of the heteroatom substitution on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties and charge carrier mobilities of these polymers is discussed. The results indicate that by increasing the size of the chalcogen atom (S < Se < Te), polymer band gaps are narrowed mainly due to LUMO energy level stabilization. In addition, the larger heteroatomic size also increases intermolecular heteroatom-heteroatom interactions facilitating the formation of polymer aggregates leading to enhanced field-effect mobilities of 1.6 cm(2)/(V s). Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the chalcogenophene polymer series blended with fullerene derivatives show good photovoltaic properties, with power conversion efficiencies ranging from 7.1-8.8%. A high photoresponse in the near-infrared (NIR) region with excellent photocurrents above 20 mA cm(-2) was achieved for all polymers, making these highly efficient low band gap polymers promising candidates for use in tandem solar cells."

It is estimated that the molecular length of the longest 48-mer reaches approximately 18.6 nm. The systematic studies of the oligothiophenes have provided valuable information on the optical and conductive properties of α-conjugated thiophene systems : an effective conjugation length extends to 20-30 thiophene units, and the active charge carrier species are both π-dimers and chain dimers.

Fullerene molecules exhibit a high reactivity towards both nucleophilic substitutions and electronic reductions. Unlike most of highly conjugated aromatics, they are relatively inert to the electronic oxidation showing a remarkable stability even under doping with arsenic pentafluoride at solid state. We demonstrated that the reactivity of electrophilic substitution on fullerenes can be significantly enhanced. We outline methods for the preparation of polyhydroxylated fullerene derivatives through the reaction of fullerenes with electrophilic reagents. The synthetic methods include the aqueous acid chemistry and the nitronium chemistry for the conversion of fullerenes to fullerols. Structure of this type of fullerols was characterized to consist of hemi-ketal functions linked with an enol ether in addition to tertiary hydroxy groups. Novel synthesis of fullerols involves the hydrolysis of polysulfated fullerene precursors, which were prepared from the reaction of C/sub 60/ with H/sub 2/SO/sub 4-/SO/sub 3/ under N/sub 2/ at 55-60/spl deg/C.

The polymer dyad and oligomer of anthracene-9,10-diyl (Oligo-ANT) are prepared by Grignard Metathesis. The higher order of crystallinity and molecular chains ordering at solid phase reveal the intrinsic optical and electrical properties of polymeric dyad resulting in relatively higher light harvesting ability compared to the oligo(anthracene-9,10-diyl). The UV-visible spectrum of (Oligo-ANT-b-P3HT) in solution shows broad absorption with two sets of absorption from both anthracene and thiophene core units, covering a wide range of the visible spectrum. The test devices of the blends of polymeric dyad with fullerene C61 (PCBM) show improved photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of 3.26% upon subjecting to pre-fabrication thermal treatments. With optimized morphology of the interpenetrating network and the shorter fluorescence lifetime of the annealed dyad/PCBM blends, the effective charge transfer from the donor dyad to PCBM has evidenced.

[70]PCPP and [70]PCBM showed more or less equally high performances in solar cells comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor polymer. Optical modeling revealed that the application of [70]fullerene derivatives as acceptor materials in P3HT-based bulk heterojunction solar cells might give approximately 10 % higher short circuit current densities than using C₆₀-based materials such as [60]PCBM.

196,10.1021/ar900073s,2009.0,Alternating polyfluorenes collect solar light in polymer photovoltaics.,"The effort to improve the energy conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells has led to the design of novel donor polymers. To improve open circuit photovoltages (OCVs) and the spectral coverage of the solar spectrum, researchers have looked for materials with high HOMO values, an easily modified electronic structure, and sufficient electronic transport within the polymers. One advance in design from our laboratories has been the development of a class of alternating polyfluorene copolymers (APFOs), which can be combined with fullerenes to make bulk heterojunction materials for photovoltaic conversion. This Account describes copolymers of fluorene that we designed to expand the range the optical absorption of solar cells to include wavelengths out to 1000 nm. In most cases, we combine these polymers with acceptors from the fullerene family, typically the phenyl C(61) butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) molecule, to generate solar cell materials. The synthesis of alternating copolymers of fluorene with various donor-acceptor-donor elements provides the opportunity to shift both HOMO and LUMO, which we have followed by electrochemical spectroscopy. Moving the LUMO of the APFOs farther from the vacuum level eventually leads to a situation where the driving force for photo-induced charge transfer from polymer donor to fullerene acceptor goes to zero, resulting in inefficient charge generation. Moving the HOMO level closer to the vacuum level reduces the OCV of devices made from bulk heterojunction blends. As we move the bandgap toward lower energies and increase the overlap of optical absorption with the solar spectrum, both these events eventually occur. In devices based on these APFO/fullerene blends, the performance depends on the OCV, the photocurrent under solar illumination, and the fill factor. The fill factor is influenced by electrical transport and charge generation. Optimizing these parameters requires new solutions to the perennial conflict between optically thin devices, where electrical extraction of charge is not a limitation, and the optically thick devices, where extraction of charge is hampered by trapping and recombination. As a result, we have developed methods to trap light in optically thin devices. When the thin film flexible solar cells are folded, multiple reflection between adjacent solar cells leads to a longer path length for the photon through the devices and considerable improvement of the optical dissipation in the active material. These optical tricks also enable an alternative route to tandem devices, where two different bandgap materials are located on adjacent folds. Thus light not absorbed in one cell is reflected onto the next cell to produce an effective optical series arrangement. Using experiments and simulations of the light trapping effects, we demonstrate power conversion efficiency enhancements of up to a factor of 1.8."

200,10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00207,2021.0,Corannulene: A Curved Polyarene Building Block for the Construction of Functional Materials.,"ConspectusThis Account describes a body of research in the design and synthesis of molecular materials prepared from corannulene. Corannulene (C20H10) is a molecular bowl of carbon that can be visualized as the hydrogen-terminated cap of buckminsterfullerene. Due to this structural resemblance, it is often referred to as a buckybowl. The bowl can invert, accept electrons, and form host-guest complexes. Due to these characteristics, corannulene presents a useful building block in materials chemistry.In macromolecular science, for example, assembly of amphiphilic copolymers carrying a hydrophobic corannulene block enables micelle formation in water. Such micellar nanostructures can host large amounts of fullerenes (C60 and C70) in their corannulene-rich core through complementarity of the curved π-surfaces. Covalent stabilization of the assembled structures then leads to the formation of robust water-soluble fullerene nanoparticles. Alternatively, use of corannulene in a polymer backbone allows for the preparation of electronic and redox-active materials. Finally, a corannulene core enables polymer chains to respond to solution temperature changes and form macroscopic fibrillar structures. In this way, the corannulene motif brings a variety of properties to the polymeric materials.In the design of non-fullerene electron acceptors, corannulene is emerging as a promising aromatic scaffold. In this regard, placement of sulfur atoms along the rim can cause an anodic shift in the molecular reduction potential. Oxidation of the sulfur atoms can further enhance this shift. Thus, a variation in the number, placement, and oxidation state of the sulfur atoms can create electron acceptors of tunable and high strengths. An advantage of this molecular design is that material solubility can also be tuned. For example, water-soluble electron acceptors can be created and are shown to improve the moisture resistance of perovskite solar cells.Host-guest complexation between corannulene and γ-cyclodextrin under flow conditions of a microfluidic chamber allows for the preparation of water-soluble nanoparticles. Due to an oligosaccharide-based sugarcoat, the nanoparticles are biocompatible while the corannulene component renders them active toward nonlinear absorption and emission properties. Together, these attributes allow the nanoparticles to be used as two-photon imaging probes in cancer cells.Finally, aromatic extension of the corannulene nucleus is seen as a potential route to nonplanar nanographenes. Typically, such endeavors rely upon gas-phase synthesis or metal-catalyzed coupling protocols. Recently, two new approaches have been established in this regard. Photochemically induced oxidative cyclization, the Mallory reaction, is shown to be a general method to access corannulenes with an extended π-framework. Alternatively, solid-state ball milling can achieve this goal in a highly efficient manner. These new protocols bring practicality and sustainability to the rapidly growing area of corannulene-based nanographenes.In essence, corannulene presents a unique building block in the construction of functional materials. In this Account, we trace our own efforts in the field and point toward the challenges and future prospects of this area of research."
201,10.1002/marc.202200530,2022.0,Benzotriazole-Based Non-Fused Ring Acceptors for Efficient and Thermally Stable Organic Solar Cells.,"Non-fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) have attracted significant attention for non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) owing to their chemical tunability and facile synthesis. In this study, a benzotriazole-based NFRA with chlorinated end groups (Triazole-4Cl) is developed to realize highly efficient and thermally stable NFRA-based OSCs; an analogous NFRA with non-chlorinated end groups (Triazole-H) is synthesized for comparison. Triazole-4Cl film exhibits the high-order packing structure and the near-infrared absorption capability, which are advantageous in charge transport and light harvesting of the resulting OSCs. In particular, the strong crystalline behavior of Triazole-4Cl results in enhanced self-aggregation, leading to high charge carrier mobility. Owing to these properties, a PBDB-T(polymer donor):Triazole-4Cl OSC demonstrates a high short-circuit current, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency (PCE = 10.46%), outperforming a PBDB-T:Triazole-H OSC (PCE = 7.65%). In addition, the thermal stability of a PBDB-T:Triazole-4Cl OSC at an elevated temperature of 120°C exceeds that of a PBDB-T:Triazole-H OSC. This is mainly attributed to the significantly higher cold crystallization temperature of Triazole-4Cl (205.9°C). This work provides useful guidelines for the design of NFRAs to achieve efficient and thermally stable NFRA-based OSCs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
202,10.1021/MA7022099,2008.0,Self-Assembling of Novel Fullerene-Grafted Donor–Acceptor Rod−Coil Block Copolymers,"Fullerene-grafted rod−coil block copolymers, designed for being used as active polymer layers in donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices, have been synthesized. The copolymer synthesis was monitored by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, size exclusion chromatography and infrared absorption spectroscopy, while the material properties were explored by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, UV–vis absorption, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Structural properties of bulk materials and thin films were investigated to study the influence of the coil block molecular weight as well as that of the grafted fullerenes on the molecular self-assembling process. The results show that the rod homopolymer is in the crystalline state at ambient temperature and undergoes a phase transition into a smectic-type liquid-crystalline phase at 55 °C. The rod−coil microphase separation enhances interlamellar ordering but destabilizes the intralamellar order, leading to the appearance of a liquid-crystalline ph..."

The optical band gap of copolymers is very low, 1.87 eV for SeBT and 1.77 eV for SeBSe. The efficient fast energy transfer from fluorene segments to narrow-band-gap sites was observed. The emission of photoluminescence and electroluminescence is dominated by narrow-band-gap species and peaked at 670−790 nm, in the range from deep-red to near-infrared (NIR).

204,10.1039/C3PY00061C,2013.0,Synthesis and photo-induced charge separation of confined conjugation length phenylene vinylene-based polymers,We report the synthesis and photophysics of four confined chromophore phenylene vinylene (PPV)-based polymers where PPV-type trimer chromophores are linked by alkyl ether chains of increasing length (PT3–PT6). These confined chromophore polymers were blended in a 1 : 1 w/w ratio with the fullerene derivative PCBM and the photoinduced charge-separation properties compared to that of a fully conjugated polymer analogue (alt-co-MEH-PPV). Fluorescence from all polymers is quenched in the presence of PCBM and transient absorption measurements confirm the presence of polymer polarons arising from charge transfer from the polymer to the PCBM acceptor. The polaron decay kinetics of all the blend films were similar but the yields of polarons for the confined conjugation length polymers were lower than for alt-co-MEH-PPV:PCBM. These observations suggest that many of the initially formed radical ion pairs for the confined length polymers are unable to fully charge dissociate and undergo fast geminate recombination.

208,10.1002/aenm.201801001,2018.0,Progress in Poly (3‐Hexylthiophene) Organic Solar Cells and the Influence of Its Molecular Weight on Device Performance,"Poly (3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was an early frontrunner in the development of donor polymers to be used in organic photovoltaics. A relatively straightforward and inexpensive synthesis suggests that it may be the most viable donor polymer to use in large‐scale commercial organic solar cells. Replacing fullerenes with new electron acceptors has led to significant improvements in device performance and stability, with devices now able to exceed an efficiency of 7%. Past studies have reported a dependence of device performance on the molecular weight of the polymer in fullerene‐containing blends, however, with nonfullerene acceptors now showing promise a similar study was needed. P3HT blends, with two nonfullerene acceptors (O‐IDTBR and EH‐IDTBR), were probed using a number of polymer batches with varying molecular weights. O‐IDTBR was shown to exhibit a dependence on the polymer molecular weight, with optimal performance achieved with a 34 kDa polymer, while EH‐IDTBR displayed an independence in performance with varying polymer molecular weight. Probing the thermal and morphological behavior of the P3HT:O‐IDTBR blends suggests that an optimal morphology with pronounced donor and acceptor domains was only achieved with the 34 kDa polymer, and a greater degree of mixing was exhibited in the other blends, likely leading to poorer device performance."

This synthetic strategy, involving two species containing a precise number of functional groups, gives greater control over the formation of polymer-fullerene hybrid structures. Phenol-functionalized fullerenes have been prepared by reaction of C[sub 60] with bis(p-methoxyphenyl)diazomethane followed by hydrolysis of the methyl ethers with BBr[sub 3]. This synthesis has been tailored to yield a 6-6 bridged methano fullerene derivative carrying only two phenolic sites as the major product. Polyether dendrimers prepared by the convergent synthesis route are ideally suited for attachment to phenol-functionalized buckyballs since they carry a single electrophilic site at their focal point, and their attachment to phenolic moieties has been studied extensively. The formation of fullerene-bound dendrimers was accomplished by reaction of each of the two phenolic groups located at the surface of the functionalized fullerene with the single benzylic bromide group at the focal point of a fourth-generation dendrimer in the presence of K[sub 2]CO[sub 3].

210,10.1103/PhysRevB.81.214114,2009.0,Fullerene-based one-dimensional crystalline nanopolymer formed through topochemical transformation of the parent nanowire,"Large-scale practical applications of fullerene (C60) in nanodevices could be significantly facilitated if the commercially-available micrometer-scale raw C60 powder were further processed into a one-dimensional (1D) nanowire-related polymer displaying covalent bonding as molecular interlinks and resembling traditional important conjugated polymers. However, there has been little study thus far in this area despite the abundant literature on fullerene. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of such a C60-based nanowire polymer, (-C60TMB-)n, where TMB=1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, which displays a well-defined crystalline structure, exceptionally large length-to-width ratio and excellent thermal stability. The material is prepared by first growing the corresponding nanowire through a solution phase of C60 followed by a topochemical polymerization reaction in the solid state. Gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance evidence is provided for the nature of the covalent bonding mode adopted by the polymeric chains. Theoretical analysis based on detailed calculations of the reaction energetics and structural analysis provides an in-depth understanding of the polymerization pathway.

The 1:1 host-guest system M-DTrpHA/fullerene exhibits a moderate association constant K(a) (6.62 × 10(4) to 6.46 × 10(5) M(-1)). Both of the metal ions in M-DTrpHA and the substituents connected to the fullerene core play important roles in stabilizing the M-DTrpHA/fullerene complex. Transient absorption spectral and NIR absorption spectral results demonstrate that, in the M-DTrpHA/fullerene system, efficient photoinduced electron transfer from the tryptamine group in M-DTrpHA to fullerene may occur, resulting in a long-lived fullerene anion radical. The observed order of quantum yield (Φ(ET)(T)) and rate constants (K(ET)(T)) for electron transfer via (3)C(60)(*) is Y(3+)-DTrpHA > La(3+)-DTrpHA > DTrpHA, consistent with their binding ability to C(60).

212,10.1002/adfm.201802004,2018.0,Ternary Blend Strategy for Achieving High‐Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Nonfullerene Acceptors Involved,"Nonfullerene acceptors have recently drawn considerable attention in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 14% is achieved in single‐junction fullerene‐free OSCs, which has surpassed that of fullerene‐based counterparts. For future commercial applications, however, a high and stable PCE > 15% is required, which entails rational material design and device optimization. In this context, three approaches are generally utilized—the synthesis of novel nonfullerene acceptors and the selection of suitable polymer donors to pair with them, the tandem or multijunction device architecture, and the ternary blend strategy. Compared to the former two methods, the ternary strategy allows to employ the existing photovoltaic materials and the single‐junction device. Therefore, an exploration of nonfullerene acceptor–based ternary blend OSCs (NFTSCs) has shown unprecedented progress since 2016. This review summarizes and classifies the photovoltaic materials utilized in NFTSCs, aiming to not only exhibit the recent development of NFTSCs but also elucidate the correlation among donor/acceptor materials, film morphology, transport dynamics, and device fabrication toward high‐efficiency OSCs.

The photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of PT-F were investigated and compared with its control polymer PT-K without C60 on its side chain. The polymer PT-F exhibited the characteristic reduction peaks of C60 at −0.783, −1.187, and −1.651 V vs Ag/Ag+, which indicates that the electronic properties of C60 remained in the double-cable polymer. In comparison with PT-K, the onset oxidation potential of PT-F was increased from 0.2 to 0.3 V vs Ag/Ag+, which could be ascribed to the steric hindrance of the big fullerene side chain. The results of the absorption and photoluminescent spectra indicate that there is no interaction at ground state between polythiophene main chains and C60 on the side chains, but there is strong interaction between them at excited state.

218,10.1039/C4TA02276A,2014.0,Efficient inverted bulk-heterojunction solar cells from low-temperature processing of amorphous ZnO buffer layers,"In this report, we demonstrate that solution-processed amorphous zinc oxide (a-ZnO) interlayers prepared at low temperatures (∼100 °C) can yield inverted bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells that are as efficient as nanoparticle-based ZnO requiring comparably more complex synthesis or polycrystalline ZnO films prepared at substantially higher temperatures (150–400 °C). Low-temperature, facile solution-processing approaches are required in the fabrication of BHJ solar cells on flexible plastic substrates, such as PET. Here, we achieve efficient inverted solar cells with a-ZnO buffer layers by carefully examining the correlations between the thin film morphology and the figures of merit of optimized BHJ devices with various polymer donors and PCBM as the fullerene acceptor. We find that the most effective a-ZnO morphology consists of a compact, thin layer with continuous substrate coverage. In parallel, we emphasize the detrimental effect of forming rippled surface morphologies of a-ZnO, an observation which contrasts with results obtained in polycrystalline ZnO thin films, where rippled morphologies have been reported to improve efficiency. After optimizing the a-ZnO morphology at low processing temperature for inverted P3HT:PCBM devices, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ca. 4.1%, we demonstrate inverted solar cells with low bandgap polymer donors on glass/flexible PET substrates: PTB7:PC71BM (PCE: 6.5% (glass)/5.6% (PET)) and PBDTTPD:PC71BM (PCE: 6.7% (glass)/5.9% (PET)). Finally, we show that a-ZnO based inverted P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells maintain ca. 90–95% of their initial PCE even after a full year without encapsulation in a nitrogen dry box, thus demonstrating excellent shelf stability. The insight we have gained into the importance of surface morphology in amorphous zinc oxide buffer layers should help in the development of other low-temperature solution-processed metal oxide interlayers for efficient flexible solar cells."

After that, the macroinitiator was further reacted with styrene and chloromethyl:styrene via an ATRP mechanism. Finally, the above copolymer was functionalized with fullerene via an ATRA mechanism to obtain the donor-acceptor block copolymer. Chemical structures, molecular weight and thermal properties of the prepared block copolymer was confirmed by using FTIR, 1H-NMR, TGA, and UV-Visible spectroscopy technique. Next, the polymer solar cells were fabricated by coating P3HT/C60 onto ITO glass, using a spin coating technique. Au electrode was then coated on top of the active layer, using a thermal evaporator. From the results, it was found that power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the normal cell (P3HT/C60) is 0.02 %. However by adding the prepared block copolymer, PCE of the cell increased to 0.23 %."

We report here results of experiments which indicate that the dications of C{sub 60} and C{sub 70} may initiate the polymerization of the conventional polymerization monomer 1,3-butadiene in the gas phase. The results suggest a potential role for fullerene dications generally as initiators of polymerization. A novel feature of the proposed mechanism of this polymerization is the role which Coulombic repulsion between the two positive charges may play in driving the direction of polymerization. 8 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab."

In this study, a novel absorber polymer was synthesized, blended with fullerene and deposited with inkjet printing for solar cell applications. A fluorene based terpolymer with dialkyl substituted diphenyl-dithienylbenzopyrazine and triphenylamine units was synthesized by Suzuki polymerization with high molecular weights. The introduction of dialkyl substituted diphenyldithienylbenzopyrazine in the fluorene main chain leads to LUMO-energy level of -3.1 eV and to an open circuit voltage of 0.96 V in solar cells. All the requirements were fulfilled to achieve absorber polymers with high efficiencies including a HOMO energy level which is lower than -5.2 eV, a band gap in the range of 1.3-1.9 eV and a hole mobility in OTFTs greater than 1 x 10-3cm2/Vs. Solar cells with printed layers were compared to those with spin coated films in order to evaluate inkjet printing as a thin film deposition method. Efficiency values of 3.7% were found for devices with inkjet printed layers or spin coated layers when using chlorinated solvents. In order to be able to use inkjet printing on a large scale, hazardous, chlorinated solvents should be avoided when depositing the functional materials. Anisol/tetralin was used as an alternative solvent system. It was found that devices prepared from the chlorine-free system showed only slightly lower efficiencies of 2.7% with respect to the chlorinated system. A coarser phase separation was found with energy filtered transmission electron microscopy plasmon mapping which most likely resulted in the performance differences for the chlorinated and chlorine-free solvent systems."

Poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester nanoparticle inks were prepared via this modified miniemulsion method, leading to both an improvement in photoactive layer morphology and a substantial reduction in the ink fabrication time. A combination of UV-visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy measurements revealed a nanoparticle morphology comprising highly intermixed donor-acceptor domains. Consistent with these measurements, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis of the nanoparticles showed a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 104 °C, rather than a pure polymer phase or pure fullerene phase Tg. Together the spectroscopy, microscopy and thermomechanical data indicate that rapid solvent removal generates a more blended nanoparticle morphology. As such, this study highlights a new experimental lever for optimising nanostructure in the photoactive layer of nanoparticulate organic photovoltaic devices by enabling highly intermixed donor-acceptor architectures to be built from customised nanoparticulate inks."

A solar cell’s power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the product of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) divided by the incident light power density. The Voc of polymer solar cells is generally proportional to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the electron donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electron acceptor, suggesting that polymers with deep HOMO levels are advantageous if conditions are otherwise similar. Photovoltaic cells have had PCEs of ca. 5% reported when a mixture of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a fullerene derivative were respectively used as the electron donor and acceptor.

We have also synthesized conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications. Especially, a polymer consisting of alternating carbazole and ester group-substituted thieno[3,4b]thiophene units (PCTT1) showed a band gap of 2.1 eV and HOMO level of −5.52 eV. This polymer, blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), when used as the photoactive layer of solar cells, yielded a maximum PCE of 2.53%. Polyfluorenes have advantages such as thermal and oxidation stabilities. They can also form films easily and have good hole-transporting properties. The band gaps and HOMO levels of fluorene-containing polymers have been reported to be similar to those of carbazole-containing counterpart polymers, though different PCEs were shown by resulting polymer-based solar cells.

In particular the open-circuit voltage of devices is increased from 0.1 V to about 0.7 V, which results in a drastic rise in photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of up to 3%. At the same time, presence of the functionalised fullerene additives prevents the detrimental formation of micrometre-sized fullerene crystals upon annealing at 140 degrees C. As a result, the device performance is retained, which promises significantly increased thermal stability of the bulk-heterojunction blend nanostructure."
257,,2003.0,Fullerene-containing poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) complexes synthesized in the presence of tetraphenylporphyrin,"Ternary complexes C 60 -tetraphenylporphyrin-poly(vinylpyrrolidone) were synthesized and characterized. The synthesis of these complexes provides a fivefold increase in the amount of water-soluble C 60 compared to complexation of C 60 with poly(vinylpyrrolidone). Using the methods of 13 C NMR spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering, it was shown that complexation occurs in a C 50 -tetraphenylporphyrin binary system; the composition of the C 60 -tetraphenylporphyrin (1 : 1) complex was established from isothermal translation diffusion measurements. According to hydrodynamic and electro-optical studies of ternary C 60 -tetraphenylporphyrin-poly(vinylpyrrolidone) systems, the polymer coil involved in the complexes of interest exhibits a higher symmetry compared to free poly(vinylpyrrolidone). It was found that an increase in the content of C 60 in the ternary complex leads to the appearance of aggregates in its aqueous solutions."

The polymer shows optical absorption in two wavelength ranges, λ < 500 nm and 600 < λ < 1000 nm. The BTPF70 absorbs light at λ < 700 nm. A broad photocurrent spectral response in the wavelength range 300 < λ < 1000 nm is obtained in solar cells. A photocurrent density of 3.4 mA cm–2, open‐circuit voltage of 0.58 V, and power‐conversion efficiency of 0.7 % are achieved under illumination of AM1.5 (1000 W m–2) from a solar simulator.

The structures are characterized by MS, 1H-NMR, and IR, and the photoluminescent properties are investigated by UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectra. The results show that the polymer emits blue and blue–violet light. The luminescence quantum yield is 0.424 in ethanol and the emission spectra exhibit obvious solvent effects. In addition, the light emitting can be quenched by both electron donor (N,N-dimethylaniline) and electron acceptor (fullerene), where the processes follow the Stern–Volmer equation. Moreover, the interaction between F-DMBN and carbon nanotubes is also studied by fluorescent quenching. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 98: 434–438, 2005"

Large progresses have been made over the last years using MDMO-PPV (Poly[2-methoxy-5-(3’,7’-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) reaching efficiencies of 2.9% and recently efficiencies over 3%, using poly(3-hexyl thiophene). A great deal of research however has still to be invested to improve the current state of the art. Among the main key-points to be addressed are namely the stability and lifetime of such devices. We are currently working on bulk heterojunction solar cells made from MDMO-PPV and PCBM (methano-fullerene[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester). Different batches of MDMO-PPV, originating from different synthesis modes (classical ""Gilch"" synthesis and ""Sulphinyl"" synthesis led by IMEC-IMOMEC) have been tested. Evolution of the power efficiency following continuous illumination (AM1.5, 80 mW.cm-2) was characterized under controlled atmosphere of nitrogen.

It was shown that these polymers form stable complexes with univalent copper salts. Mechanical and therrnomechanical measurements support the assumption that an additional system of intermolecular bonds that is absent in the original polymer occurs in metal-polymer complexes. The photosensitivity of metal-polymer complexes increases by an order of magnitude compared to the original polymer. It was found that the quantum yield of charge-carrier photogeneration in the complexes may be significantly increased upon incorporation of fullerene."
263,10.1080/1536383X.2018.1535490,2019.0,Effect of surface nature of carbonaceous nanosized fillers on properties of polyurethane based nanocomposites,"Abstract Polyurethane (PU) composites containing uniformly dispersed nanosized and macrosized carbonaceous fillers (fullerene C60, fullerene soot, detonation nanodiamonds, and nanodiamonds soot) with loadings varying from 0.1 to 0.5 wt.% were prepared by in situ polymerization. The kinetics of PU synthesis catalyzed by dibutyltin dilaurate was studied as a function of amount of nanosized filler. It was found that the reaction is zero-order. The kinetics of the hard domain growth of the PU matrix was studied and described successfully using the two-parameter Avrami model for isothermal crystallization. It was found that the growth of polymers induces athermal primary nucleation for hard domain growth, and that nanosized fillers do not change the nucleation mechanism. Our results show that the mechanical strength of PU composites increases in the presence of all types of nanoparticles under study. This can be related to the antiplasticization effect of the nanoparticles on the polymer matrix. The dielectric spectroscopy demonstrated that Tg values of the composites increase in comparison with neat PU. However, the effects of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of nanoparticles on the secondary relaxations are not obvious Microphase separation in these nanocomposites was studied using FTIR spectroscopy, but no effect of surface properties of the nanoadditives on this phenomenon has been observed."

265,,2002.0,"PAHs Formation Characteristics and Fullerenes $(C_{60},\;C_{70})$ Synthesis in a Low-Pressure $C_6H_6/Ar/O_2$ Flame","Carbon molecules with closed-cage structures are called fullerenes , whose applications include super-conductors, sensors, catalysts, optical and electronic device, polymer composites, and biological and medical materials. The synthesis of fullerenes has been recently studied with low-pressure benzene/argon/oxygen flames. The formation of fullerene is known as molecular weight growth processes of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon). This study presents results of PAHs and fullerene measurements performed in a low-pressure benzene/argon/oxygen normal co-flow laminar diffusion flame. Through the central tube of the burner, benzene vapors carried by argon are injected. The benzene vapors are made in a temperature-controlled bubbler. The burner is located in a chamber, equipped with a sampling system for direct collection of condensable species from the flame, and exhausted to a vacuum pump. Samples of the condensable are analyzed by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) to determine the yields of PAHs and fullerene. Also, we computed mole fraction of fullerene and PAHs in a nearly sooting low pressure premixed, one-dimensional benzene/argon/oxygen flame (equivalence ratio , pressure=5.33kPa). The object of computation was to investigate the formation mechanism of fullerenes and PAHs. The computations were performed with CHEMKIN/PREMIX. As a result of this study, fullerenes were synthesized in a low pressure (20torr) flames and the highest concentration of fullerene was detected just above the visible surface of a flame."

Systematically varying the tether lengths between the fullerene cage and tertiary amines provides insight into enhanced device efficiency and stability after poling.

The graft copolymer, obtained by nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization of a vinyl triazole onto a postfunctionalized poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) backbone, is blended with a fullerene modified with a pendant triazole functionality (TAZC60). For a given ratio of polymer:TAZC60, graft copolymer (P3HT-g-PVTAZ:TAZC60) blends exhibit substantially reduced photoluminescence compared to P3HT:TAZC60 blends, while TEM analysis reveals the graft polymer undergoes extensive mixing with the fullerene to form bicontinuous 10 nm phase domains. Graft polymer blends annealed for 1 h at 140 degrees C retain their nanometer phase separation as evidenced by TEM, UV-vis, XRD, and photoluminescence analysis, and phase purity was enhanced. In contrast, P3HT:TAZC60 blends exhibit micron-sized phase-segregated morphologies before and after annealing. The chemical similarity of the triazole functionality attached to P3HT and the fullerene leads to the formation of films with uniform, stable, nanophase morphologies. This strategy may prove a useful strategy for controlling the extent of phase segregation in electron donor and acceptor blends of pi-conjugated polymers (piCPs) and fullerenes."

We report the synthesis of crosslinkable derivatives of the low bandgap polymer PFDTBT, poly(2,7-(9,9-dialkylfluorene)-alt-(5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole))), and the stabilization of BHJ solar cells by crosslinking. Oxetane units are attached to the polymer side chains as crosslinkable functional groups. We study the crosslinking of the polymers via cationic ring opening polymerization of the oxetanes and show that our materials rapidly form insoluble networks. Our materials also crosslink in the presence of fullerenes. We report for the first time that crosslinking takes place upon prolonged heating to 100 °C without any added initiator. The best efficiency and thermal stability are found in thermally crosslinked BHJ solar cells. After 30 hours at 100 °C, 65% of the initial efficiency are retained and no further decay is observed up to 100 hours."
275,10.1039/C6RA14858A,2016.0,Zinc oxide nanorod doped graphene for high efficiency organic photovoltaic devices,"We report the synthesis of zinc oxide nanorod (ZnR) doped graphene (G) for high performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices based on a low bandgap polymer, poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) blended with a fullerene derivative (PC71BM). The use of ZnR–G in a PTB7:PC71BM-based inverted OPV device leads to substantial enhancement in device performance in contrast to the reference devices. The improved performance is attributed to the improved charge carrier separation and prolonged lifetime of the generated electron–hole pairs. In addition, we also found that extra pathways for the disappearance of the charge carriers exist due to the interactions between the excited ZnR and G, which shows that the ZnR–G have a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes under UV light illumination."

277,,2017.0,Semiconducting Polymers and Hybrids for OPVs and PLEDs: Scalability and Optoelectronic Properties Modulation,"Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) and polymeric light emitting diodes (PLEDs) are technologies where polymeric semiconductors are used providing a thin film, called the ""active layer"", which is responsible for the operation of the device. 
In the case of OPVs, polymer semiconducting electron donors are combined with electron acceptors, typically fullerenes or other carbon based nanostructures, forming a bicontinuous interpenetrating network. The efficiency of these so called Bulk Heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs is greatly dependant on the exact materials combinations as well as the morphology of the active layer. Our efforts were devoted on the scale up synthesis of the different efficient polymeric electron donors as well as their application on printable OPV devices thereof. Also control and stabilization of the active layer�s blend morphology was attempted through the incorporation of a third component acting as compatiblizer and/or stabilizer. Thus, employment of hybrid polymer-fullerene [1,2] additives, comprising the electron donating polymer and the fullerenic electron acceptor part was used in order to enhance the stability of the active blend. 
In the case of PLEDs, both semiconducting polymers and polymeric metallocomplexes [3] are used in order to obtain the desired colored emission. Working in this direction, polymeric materials with controlled light emission have been synthesized and used for PLEDS device construction and testing [4]. Moreover, we also combined different chromophore bearing light emitting polymers and copolymers with Iridium (Ir) based polymeric metallocomplexes in different ratios in order to effectively control the final light emission. Depending on the well-defined copolymers� composition and even using polymer blends, the optoelectronic properties of the final active materials were modulated leading to the fine tuning of the light emission properties of the final materials and devices.

We showed that the bulk morphology of polymer/fullerene blend solar cells could be controlled by using either self-assembled polymer semiconductor nanowires or diblock poly(3-alkylthiophenes) as the light-absorbing and hole transport component. We developed new characterization tools in-house, including photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectroscopy, time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (TR-EFM) and conductive and photoconductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM and pc-AFM), and used them to investigate charge transfer and recombination dynamics in polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells, hybrid polymer-nanocrystal (PbSe) devices, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs); we thus showed in detail how the bulk photovoltaic properties are connected to the nanoscale structure of the BHJ polymer solar cells. We created various oxide semiconductor (ZnO, TiO2) nanostructures by solution processing routes, including hierarchical aggregates and nanorods/nanotubes, and showed that the nanostructured photoanodes resulted in substantially enhanced light-harvesting and charge transport, leading to enhanced power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells."

We demonstrate that the gradient sequence copolymers exhibit unique thermal, optical andmorphological properties compared to the analogous block and random copolymers.

282,10.32657/10356/48006,2012.0,Block copolymer assisted preparation of functional nano-composites,"i Abstract Block copolymers are widely used in the field of nanotechnology for the production of functional nanomaterials and nanocomposites. We report a technique for the synthesis of C60/polymer colloid nanocomposites in aqueous medium from a non-aqueous system via complex formation. A tri-block poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-polyethylene-b-poly(4vinylpyridine), P4VP8-b-PEO105-b-P4VP8 was complexed with fullerene (C60) in toluene via charge transfer complex formation, which resulted in a fullerene assembly in cluster form. A nanocomposite dispersion in aqueous solution could be obtained using an aged solution of the polymer/C60/toluene by solvent evaporation technique. However, the rate of complexation was found to be slow in toluene and took several months for unmodified fullerene (C60) to complete. Rate enhancement of the charge transfer complex formation was attempted using fullerene derivative (PCBM) instead of fullerene (C60) in toluene and THF system. The reaction was found to be typically fast in THF compared with toluene system, which allowed us to study the interaction kinetics of the reaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results show that the reaction follows pseudo-first order kinetics and the P4VP units in the copolymer interact with the fullerene derivative more than two order of magnitude faster than does the small molecular model compound tertbutylpyridine. Based on this understanding, studies were carried out to enhance the rate o charge transfer complex formation of underivatized fullerene (C60) with PS-b-P4VP. Rapid assembly of C60/PS-b-P4VP composite was realized using a mixed solvent. The poor solubility of C60 in THF was overcome by first dissolving C60 in toluene before adding in THF. The complexation reaction was completed within 10 days in THF"

287,10.1017/S1431927602103710,2002.0,TEM Characterization of WS2 Nanotubes,"Recently, large quantities (grams) of multi-walled WS2 nanotubes were obtained in a one step synthesis, using a fluidized-bed reactor that was used for the synthesis of fullerene-like WS2 nanoparticles, but under modified conditions [3]. In this process nanowhiskers of WO3-x and subsequently WS2 nanotubes were produced in a single process using commercially available WO3 nanoparticles as precursors. Very long (hundreds of micrometers) open ended nanotubes appear either as bundles in the bulk of IF-WS2 product, or as thin foils attached to the walls of the reactor. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM ) analysis of a broken area in a ribbon, obtained during the detachment of a thin foil from the reactor wall, showed long and uniform nanotubes which are mostly 4 -7 layers thick (FIG. 1a). To further analyze the structure of the ribbons, one such ribbon was embedded in a polymer matrix and subsequently cross-sectioned by ultramicrotome. TEM of such section reveals clearly well aligned nanotubes. Lattice image of few cross-sectioned nanotubes is shown in the insert (FIG. 1b). The observed nanotubes are close packed and their circular cross section was somewhat distorted, probably during the microtomy. Isolated WS2 nanotubes and bundles thereof, mixed with fullerene-like particles, were also found in the center of the reactor, consisting of 300μm long nanotubes of rather perfect shape. It is very likely that much longer nanotubes exist in the ribbons and bundles; however it was rather difficult to separate them for analysis without damaging their integrity. The flawless structure of a typical nanotube is appreciated from the high resolution TEM image showing WS2 layers separated by 6.2Å in the nanotube sidewalls (FIG. 2a). In contrast to the nanotubes in the foils, these isolated nanotubes have been shown to be of perfectly circular in cross-section, by tilting the sample along the tube axis. The nanotubes consist of coaxial-cylinders build up of hexagonal sheets. All nanotubes in this study were found to be chiral. The helicity angles of the nanotubes were determined from the electron diffration (ED) pattern [4]. In order to gain understanding of the nanotubes growth mechanism, partially reduced or sulfidized intermediates were also isolated from interrupted processes [5]. TEM image of such intermediate of a WS2 nanowhisker encapsulating a reduced oxide core is shown in FIG.2b."

is no liberation of PhI and reuse of the reagent. Meanwhile, fulleropyrrolidines have been very welcomed in a
community of a fullerene science. But sometimes the synthesis ends up with disappointing yields of the
products. We found that the dipolar cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide, i.e., 2-phenyl-N-benzylideneglycine
methyl ester, supported on a Wang resin, proceeded feasibly with C60 and the objective fulleropyrrolidines were
afforded in good yields (>75%). The method is expected to be utilized with wide range of application and it is
therefore able to provide a compound library of modified fullerenes which is hard to be obtained by other
methods employed so far.

N,N’-succinylbisdehydroalanine (SBDHA) for hydrogels. The linear copolymer, P(iBDHA-co-iBDHAM)
([iBDHA]=23-81%), showed LCST behavior in deionized water, but the LCST values were highly
polymer concentration-dependent. It is concluded that effect of carboxyl groups introduced into the

Subsequently, several advanced technologies have been developed for water treatment. The most successful methodology considered so far is the development of water filtration membranes for desalination, ion permeation, and microbes handling. Various types of membranes have been industrialized including nanofiltration, microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultrafiltration membranes. Among polymeric nanocomposites, nanocarbon (fullerene, graphene, and carbon nanotubes)-reinforced nanomaterials have gained research attention owing to notable properties/applications. Here, fullerene has gained important stance amid carbonaceous nanofillers due to zero dimensionality, high surface areas, and exceptional physical properties such as optical, electrical, thermal, mechanical, and other characteristics. Accordingly, a very important application of polymer/fullerene C60 nanocomposites has been observed in the membrane sector. This review is basically focused on talented applications of polymer/fullerene nanocomposite membranes in water treatment. The polymer/fullerene nanostructures bring about numerous revolutions in the field of high-performance membranes because of better permeation, water flux, selectivity, and separation performance. The purpose of this pioneering review is to highlight and summarize current advances in the field of water purification/treatment using polymer and fullerene-based nanocomposite membranes. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of fullerene embedded into a variety of polymer membranes (Nafion, polysulfone, polyamide, polystyrene, etc.) and effects on the enhanced properties and performance of the resulting water treatment membranes. Polymer/fullerene nanocomposite membranes have been developed using solution casting, phase inversion, electrospinning, solid phase synthesis, and other facile methods. The structural diversity of polymer/fullerene nanocomposites facilitates membrane separation processes, especially for valuable or toxic metal ions, salts, and microorganisms. Current challenges and opportunities for future research have also been discussed.

291,10.1088/1361-6633/ab0530,2019.0,A review of non-fullerene polymer solar cells: from device physics to morphology control,"The rise in power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices over the last few years has been driven by the emergence of new organic semiconductors and the growing understanding of morphological control at both the molecular and aggregation scales. Non-fullerene OPVs adopting p-type conjugated polymers as the donor and n-type small molecules as the acceptor have exhibited steady progress, outperforming PCBM-based solar cells and reaching efficiencies of over 15% in 2019. This review starts with a refreshed discussion of charge separation, recombination, and VOC loss in non-fullerene OPVs, followed by a review of work undertaken to develop favorable molecular configurations required for high device performance. We summarize several key approaches that have been employed to tune the nanoscale morphology in non-fullerene photovoltaic blends, comparing them (where appropriate) to their PCBM-based counterparts. In particular, we discuss issues ranging from materials chemistry to solution processing and post-treatments, showing how this can lead to enhanced photovoltaic properties. Particular attention is given to the control of molecular configuration through solution processing, which can have a pronounced impact on the structure of the solid-state photoactive layer. Key challenges, including green solvent processing, stability and lifetime, burn-in, and thickness-dependence in non-fullerene OPVs are briefly discussed."
292,10.1021/acsami.8b20493,2019.0,Photostability of Fullerene and Non-Fullerene Polymer Solar Cells: The Role of the Acceptor,"Recently, the advent of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) made it possible for organic solar cells (OSCs) to break the 10% efficiency barrier hardly attained by fullerene acceptors (FAs). In the past five years alone, more than hundreds of NFAs with applications in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been synthesized, enabling a notable current record efficiency of above 15%. Hence, there is a shift in interest toward the use of NFAs in OPVs. However, there has been little work on the stability of these new materials in devices. More importantly, there is very little comparative work on the photostability of FA versus NFA solar cells to ascertain the pros and cons of the two systems. Here, we show the photostability of solar cells based on two workhorse acceptors, in both conventional and inverted structures, namely, ITIC (as NFA) and [70]PCBM (as FA), blended with either PBDB-T or PTB7-Th polymer. We found that, irrespective of the polymer, the cell structure, or the initial efficiency, the [70]PCBM devices are more photostable than the ITIC ones. This observation, however, opposes the assumption that NFA solar cells are more photochemically stable. These findings suggest that complementary absorption should not take precedence in the design rules for the synthesis of new molecules and there is still work left to be done to achieve stable and efficient OSCs."

NMR, elemental analysis, spectral analysis, tunnel scanning electron microscopy and X powder diffraction were used to characterize the material. Spectral analysis showed that the assembly had a wide acromion at 343nm and a large tail band absorption in the range of 350-600nm, indicating the presence of C60. From the STM images, it can be inferred that the weak interaction between the cyclodextrin cavity and the fullerene tail-to-tail form a regular linear arrangement. X-ray shows that there have many characteristic diffraction peak of 11, such as 2θ=11.52° (d=7.68Å), 2θ=14.62° (d=6.05Å), 2θ=25.5° (d=3.49 Å), 2θ=29.62° (d=3.01Å), 2θ=31.68° (d=2.82 Å), which proved that the cyclodextrin and fullerenes formed supramolecular polymers Through chemical safety tests, the results showed that there were no risk substances, pollutants, prohibited substances and restricted substances in the samples which could affect the safety of cosmetics. Phototoxicity, eye irritation/corrosiveness, skin irritation and cytotoxicity were not detected by toxicological safety test. This study provides technical data support for the use of new cyclodextrin and fullerene derivatives as cosmetic raw materials."
294,10.1039/C8EE00215K,2018.0,Efficient ternary non-fullerene polymer solar cells with PCE of 11.92% and FF of 76.5%,"Non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) attract more attention due to the constantly refreshed power conversion efficiency (PCE) based on the versatile non-fullerene acceptors. In this work, PCEs of 10.51% and 11.02% were obtained for two kinds of non-fullerene PSC with IDT6CN-M or ITCPTC as the acceptor and PBDB-T as the donor. ITCPTC has a relatively narrow bandgap and a high absorption coefficient compared with IDT6CN-M, which explains well the relatively large short-circuit current density of 17.44 mA cm−2 for the ITCPTC based binary PSCs. Meanwhile, the IDT6CN-M based binary PSCs exhibit a relatively high fill factor (FF) of 75.3% and an open-circuit voltage of 0.915 V. A PCE of 11.92% and a FF of 76.5% were achieved for the ternary PSCs with 60 wt% ITCPTC content in the acceptors, which should be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting and their good compatibility for a synergistic improvement of exciton utilization and charge transport in the ternary active layers. The FF of 76.5% is among the top values of ternary non-fullerene PSCs."

Herein, we report non-fullerene polymer solar cells with a maximal power conversion efficiency of over 11% by introducing an n-type water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymer as a cathode interlayer. We found that the contact between the n-type interlayer and the donor provides an extra interface for charge dissociation and the matching of energy levels between the n-type interlayer and the acceptor allows efficient electron extraction from the bulk heterojunction, which eventually leads to much improved performance. This study proposes a significant design rule for designing new interfaces for high performance non-fullerene photovoltaics."

In this paper, we compare mechanical properties, such as the cohesive fracture energy, elastic modulus, and crack-onset strain, of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) and fullerene-based solar cells (PCBM–PSCs) based on the same, representative low-bandgap polymer donor (PTB7-Th) as a function of acceptor content. The all-PSCs exhibit higher fracture energy (2.45 J m–2) than PCBM–PSCs (0.29 J m–2) at optimized device conditions. Additionally, a 15-fold higher crack-onset strain is observed in all-PSCs than in PCBM–PSCs.

Pronounced phase separation was observed in the active layer of the fullerene-PSCs at two different length scales. In stark contrast, almost no morphological changes in the all-PSCs were observed, likely due to the low diffusion kinetics of the polymer acceptors.

299,10.1021/ACS.ACCOUNTS.6B00347,2016.0,"From Fullerene-Polymer to All-Polymer Solar Cells: The Importance of Molecular Packing, Orientation, and Morphology Control.","All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of conjugated polymers as both electron donor (PD) and acceptor (PA), have recently attracted great attention. Remarkable progress has been achieved during the past few years, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) now approaching 8%. In this Account, we first discuss the major advantages of all-PSCs over fullerene-polymer solar cells (fullerene-PSCs): (i) high light absorption and chemical tunability of PA, which affords simultaneous enhancement of both the short-circuit current density (JSC) and the open-circuit voltage (VOC), and (ii) superior long-term stability (in particular, thermal and mechanical stability) of all-PSCs due to entangled long PA chains. In the second part of this Account, we discuss the device operation mechanism of all-PSCs and recognize the major challenges that need to be addressed in optimizing the performance of all-PSCs. The major difference between all-PSCs and fullerene-PSCs originates from the molecular structures and interactions, i.e., the electron transport ability in all-PSCs is significantly affected by the packing geometry of two-dimensional PA chains relative to the electrodes (e.g., face-on or edge-on orientation), whereas spherically shaped fullerene acceptors can facilitate isotropic electron transport properties in fullerene-PSCs. Moreover, the crystalline packing structures of PD and PA at the PD-PA interface greatly affect their free charge carrier generation efficiencies. The design of PA polymers (e.g., main backbone, side chain, and molecular weight) should therefore take account of optimizing three major aspects in all-PSCs: (1) the electron transport ability of PA, (2) the molecular packing structure and orientation of PA, and (3) the blend morphology. First, control of the backbone and side-chain structures, as well as the molecular weight, is critical for generating strong intermolecular assembly of PA and its network, thus enabling high electron transport ability of PA comparable to that of fullerenes. Second, the molecular orientation of anisotropically structured PA should be favorably controlled in order to achieve efficient charge transport as well as charge transfer at the PD-PA interface. For instance, face-to-face stacking between PD and PA at the interface is desired for efficient free charge carrier generation because misoriented chains often cause an additional energy barrier for overcoming the binding energy of the charge transfer state. Third, large-scale phase separation often occurs in all-PSCs because of the significantly reduced entropic contribution by two macromolecular chains of PD and PA that energetically disfavors mixing. In this Account, we review the recent progress toward overcoming each recognized challenge and intend to provide guidelines for the future design of PA. We believe that by optimization of the parameters discussed above the PCE values of all-PSCs will surpass the 10% level in the near future and that all-PSCs are promising candidates for the successful realization of flexible and portable power generators."

The obtained encouraging results led us to the additional theoretical analysis of the energetics and UV-Vis spectra of isolated dyes employing Density functional theory (DFT) and Time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) calculations using PBE/6-31G(d,p) and CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level calculations, respectively. The FD4 is the best C60-derivatives candidates for PSCs as it has the lowest exciton binding energy, up-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level to increase open-circuit voltage (VOC) and strong absorption in the UV region. In case of C70-derivatives, FD7 is potential candidate for future PSCs due to its strong absorption in UV-Vis region and lower exciton binding energy with higher VOC. Our optoelectronic results strongly support the developed QSPR model equation. Analyzing QSPR model and optoelectronic parameters, we concluded that the FD1, FD2, FD4, and FD10 are the most potential candidates for acceptor fragment of fullerene-based PSC. The outcomes of tactical molecular design followed by the investigation of optoelectronic features are suggested to be employed as a significant resource for the synthesis of FDs as an acceptor of PSCs."

308,10.3390/polym13203547,2021.0,"A Review on the Synthesis, Properties, and Utilities of Functionalized Carbon Nanoparticles for Polymer Nanocomposites","Carbon can form different allotropes due to its tetravalency. Different forms of carbon such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers, graphene, fullerenes, and carbon black can be used as nanofillers in order to enhance the properties of polymer nanocomposites. These carbon nanomaterials are of interest in nanocomposites research and other applications due to their excellent properties, such as high Young’s Modulus, tensile strength, electrical conductivity, and specific surface area. However, there are some flaws that can be found in the carbon nanoparticles such as tendency to agglomerate, insoluble in aqueous or organic solvents or being unreactive with the polymer surface. In this study, the aim is to study functionalization in order to rectify some of these shortcomings by attaching different functional groups or particles to the surface of these carbon nanoparticles; this also enables the synthesis of high-performance polymer nanocomposites. The main findings include the effects of functionalization on carbon nanoparticles and the applications of polymer nanocomposites with carbon nanoparticles as nanofillers in the industry. Additionally, the different methods used to produce polymer composites such as in situ polymerization, solution mixing and melt blending are studied, as these methods involve the dispersion of carbon nanofillers within the polymer matrix."
309,10.1039/C6QM00247A,2017.0,New developments in non-fullerene small molecule acceptors for polymer solar cells,"During the past two years, non-fullerene electron acceptors for organic solar cells have attracted considerable attention. Significant progress has been made in that the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells based on non-fullerene small molecule acceptors now exceeds 12%, exhibiting many advantages over their fullerene counterparts. One of the greatest strengths for NFAs is their tunability via chemical modulation to fine-tune their absorption, energy level and electronic mobility, which is difficult to achieve with fullerene derivatives. This review describes very recent developments of polymer donor:small molecular non-fullerene acceptors in several systems since 2015, including rylene imide, indacenodithiophene and diketopyrrolopyrrole-based small molecular acceptors. Molecular design considerations and structure–property relationships are also discussed."
310,10.1021/acsnano.7b06961,2017.0,Donor-Acceptor Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis and Host-Guest Coassembly with Fullerene toward Photovoltaic Application.,"Electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) units to construct donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated macrocycles were investigated to elucidate their interactions with electron-deficient fullerene. Triphenylamine and 4,7-bisthienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole were alternately linked through acetylene, as the donor and acceptor units, respectively, for pentagonal 3B2A and hexagonal 4B2A macrocycles. As detected by scanning tunneling microscopy, both D-A macrocycles were found to form an interesting concentration-controlled nanoporous monolayer on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, which could effectively capture fullerene. Significantly, the fullerene filling was cavity-size-dependent with only one C70 or PC71BM molecule accommodated by 3B2A, while two were accommodated by 4B2A. Density functional theory calculations were also utilized to gain insight into the host-guest systems and indicted that the S···π contact is responsible for stabilizing these host-guest systems. Owing to the ellipsoidal shape of C70, C70 molecules are standing or lying in molecular cavities depending on the energy optimization. For the 3B2A/PC71BM blended film, PC71BM was intercalated into the cavity formed by the macrocycle 3B2A and provided excellent power conversion efficiency despite the broad band gap (2.1 eV) of 3B2A. This study of D-A macrocycles incorporating fullerene provides insights into the interaction mechanism and electronic structure in the host-guest complexes. More importantly, this is a representative example using D-A macrocycles as a donor to match with the spherical fullerene acceptor for photovoltaic applications, which offer a good approach to achieve molecular scale p-n junctions for substantially enhanced efficiencies of organic solar cells through replacing linear polymer donors by cyclic conjugated oligomers."

IEIC exhibited good thermal stability, strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region with an extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 672 nm, deep LUMO energy level (−3.82 eV) close to those of fullerenes, and a relatively high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the blends of the IEIC acceptor and a low-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-TH, using a perylene diimide derivative as a cathode interlayer, showed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 6.31%, which is among the best PCEs reported for fullerene-free PSCs."

Composites were precipitated in the form of spherical particles, and their sizes ranged from 20 to 400 nm depending on the time of polymerization. Fullerene C60 nanocrystals with approximate size of 1 nm were uniformly distributed within the polymeric material. The amount of fullerene incorporated into polypyrrole depended on the C60 concentration in the solution used for the composite formation. An investigation of the composite using infrared spectroscopy indicated partial charge transfer between polypyrrole chains and fullerene nanocrystals. Such process was also confirmed by the theoretical investigation of electronic properties of composite. The composites were electrochemically active over a large potential window. At negative potentials, fullerene nanocrystals were reduced. In the positive potential range, polypyrrole c..."

SF(DPPB)4 exhibits energy levels matching perfectly with those of the commonly used poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) donor in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Furthermore, a designed cross-shaped molecular geometry helps in suppressing strong intermolecular aggregation in the P3HT : SF(DPPB)4 blend, leading to efficient non-fullerene PSCs. The resultant devices give a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.16% with an extremely high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.14 V. In contrast, the devices based on P3HT : PC61BM blends provide a PCE of 3.18% with a Voc of 0.62 V. Finally, we observe that the P3HT : SF(DPPB)4 devices exhibit significantly improved thermal stability from that of the P3HT : PC61BM devices; upon thermal treatment at 150 °C for 3 h, the PCEs of P3HT : SF(DPPB)4 devices remain unchanged, whereas those of the P3HT : PC61BM devices drop drastically to below 1%. The abovementioned results demonstrate that the new design strategy of employing a high-performance non-fullerene acceptor, SF(DPPB)4, is promising for the future practical application of PSCs."

It possesses excellent planarity and enhanced effective conjugation length compared to previously reported fused-ring electron acceptors. When this acceptor was paired with PTB7-Th and applied in polymer solar cells, a power conversion efficiency of 6.5% was achieved with a high open circuit voltage of 0.94 V.

316,10.1039/C7TA07882J,2017.0,Donor polymer fluorination doubles the efficiency in non-fullerene organic photovoltaics,"Donor polymer fluorination has proven to be an effective method to improve the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-based polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, this fluorine effect has not been well-studied in systems containing new, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Here, we investigate the impact of donor polymer fluorination in NFA-based solar cells by fabricating devices with either a fluorinated conjugated polymer (FTAZ) or its non-fluorinated counterpart (HTAZ) as the donor polymer and a small molecule NFA (ITIC) as the acceptor. We found that, similar to fullerene-based devices, fluorination leads to an increased open circuit voltage (Voc) from the lowered HOMO level and improved fill factor (FF) from the higher charge carrier mobility. More importantly, donor polymer fluorination in this NFA-based system also led to a large increase in short circuit current (Jsc), which stems from the improved charge transport and extraction in the fluorinated device. This study demonstrates that fluorination is also advantageous in NFA-based PSCs and may improve performance to a higher extent than in fullerene-based PSCs. In the context of other recent reports on demonstrating higher photovoltaic device efficiencies with fluorinated materials, fluorination appears to be a valuable strategy in the design and synthesis of future donors and acceptors for PSCs."

It is found that SF-PDI2 matches particularly well with PffBT4T-2DT and non-fullerene OSCs with an impressive VOC of 0.98 V, and a high power conversion efficiency of 6.3% is achieved. Our study shows that PffBT4T-2DT is a promising donor material for SMA-based OSCs, and the selection of a matching SMA is also important to achieve the best OSC performance."

Polymer-based organic photovoltaic systems hold the promise for a cost-effective, lightweight solar energy conversion platform, which could benefit from simple solution processing of the active layer. The function of such excitonic solar cells is based on photoinduced electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor. Fullerenes have become the ubiquitous acceptors because of their high electron affinity and ability to transport charge effectively. The most effective solar cells have been made from bicontinuous polymer-fullerene composites, or so-called bulk heterojunctions. The best solar cells currently achieve an efficiency of about 5%, thus significant advances in the fundamental understanding of the complex interplay between the active layer morphology and electronic properties are required if this technology is to find viable application."

In this work, we report a novel hPDI-based molecule, hPDI2-CN2, as an electron acceptor for OSCs. Combining the hPDI2-CN2 with a low-bandgap polymeric donor (PTB7-Th), the blending film morphology exhibited high sensitivity to various treatments (such as thermal annealing and addition of solvent additives), as evidenced by atomic force microscope studies. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved from 1.42% (as-cast device) to 2.76% after thermal annealing, and a PCE of 3.25% was achieved by further addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy studies revealed that the improved thin-film morphology was highly beneficial for the charge carrier transport and collection. And a combination of fast exciton diffusion rate and the lowest recombination rate contributed to the best performance of the DIO-treated device. This result further suggests that the molecular conformation needs to be taken into account in the design of perylene diimide-based acceptors for OSCs."
321,10.1039/C2JM32873A,2012.0,Material solubility and molecular compatibility effects in the design of fullerene/polymer composites for organic bulk heterojunction solar cells,We report a systematic study of more than 100 bicomponent systems composed of 19 different fullerene derivatives blended with 9 different conjugated polymers (including previously investigated poly(3-hexylthiophene)). It was shown that short circuit current density (JSC) and light power conversion efficiency (η) of the fullerene/polymer photovoltaic devices depend on the solubility of the fullerene components in the solvent used for the blend film deposition (chlorobenzene). The revealed dependences have unusual “double branch” character because many fullerene derivatives possessing similar solubilities showed different photovoltaic performances. This behavior was related to the peculiarities of the molecular structures of the fullerene derivatives. Substituents attached to the cyclopropane ring fused with the fullerene cage in methanofullerenes affected both the morphology of their composites with conjugated polymers and their photovoltaic performance. It was demonstrated that variation of the fullerene component blended with a conjugated polymer might easily change its photovoltaic performance by a factor of 3–4. The obtained results proved that design of appropriate fullerene derivatives and novel conjugated polymers are equally important tasks on the way towards highly efficient organic photovoltaics.
322,,2018.0,Synthesis and characterization of fullerene doped polyaniline/titanium dioxide nanocomposites for electromagnetic interference shielding / Nurrafiqah Mokhtar,"Fullerene doped Polyaniline (PAni) nanocomposites were synthesized through template-free method at 0°C by using aniline (Ani) as monomer, fullerene and titanium dioxide (TiO2) as fillers. Fullerene doped PAni nanocomposites with chemical treatment by sulfonic groups such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonicate (DBSA) and camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) were prepared to improve the dispersion of C60 during polymerization. Besides, PAni nanocomposites with different types of fullerene (C60 and small gap fullerene (S.G.F)) and PAni nanocomposites with different contents of C60: (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 40 %) were synthesized. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra validated the functional groups and conducting behavior of fullerene doped PAni nanocomposites, respectively. The existence of fillers in PAni nanocomposites were confirmed by the characteristic peaks of TiO2 and fullerene (C60 and S.G.F) in X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The morphology behaviors and electrical conductivity of fullerene doped PAni nanocomposites were investigated by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and resistivity meter, respectively. Fullerene doped PAni nanocomposites with chemical treatment significantly improved the formation of nanorods/nanotubes which eventually increase the electrical conductivity (5.433 × 10-2 – 1.708 × 10-1 S/cm) as compared to those without chemical treatment (3.655 × 10-2 S/cm). Among all the PAni with chemical treatment, fullerene doped PAni that treated with CSA shows the highest amount of nanorods/nanotubes and electrical conductivity of 1.708 × 10-1 S/cm. Beside, PAni with addition of C60 plays a good synergy effect which significantly enhance the electrical conductivity of PAni nanocomposites as iv 
compared to PAni with addition of S.G.F. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties of fullerene doped PAni nanocomposites were carried out by Microwave Vector Network Analyzer (MVNA) from frequency range of 0.5 GHz to 18.0 GHz. Based on the result, PAni nanocomposites with 40 % of C60 that was treated with CSA possesses the poorest EMI shielding properties with a broad and weak reflection loss (RL) peak of -6.3 dB. This is because the lowest electrical conductivity, dielectric permittivity and heterogeneity of PAni nanocomposites will possess the weakest molecular polarization that leads to the poorest EMI shielding. However, PAni formulated with 10 % of C60 that was treated with CSA revealed a narrow and sharp RL peak with the highest absorption (-61.3 dB) at 9 GHz. It is because the highest electrical conductivity (1.708 × 10-1 S/cm), dielectric permittivity and heterogeneity (larger amount of nanorods/nanotubes) of PAni will induce more disordered motion of charge carrier along the PAni backbone, thus enhanced EMI shielding properties."
323,10.24084/repqj16.454,2018.0,Design and Synthesis of New Fullerene Derivatives for Organic Solar Cells,"Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells based on p-type polymers and n-type fullerene derivatives have attracted increasing attention due to their promising potential for providing low–cost solar electricity. In this paper, we will introduce our recent work on the development of new fullerene derivatives. Through Rh complex catalyzed coupling reactions and cycloaddition reactions, we attached several organic functional groups to the fullerene skeleton. It was found that the organic substituents had little impact on the fullerene energy levels. Instead, the organic substituents have huge impact on the other physical properties of the resulting fullerene derivatives, such as solubility, crystallinity, and electron mobility. We designed and synthesized a novel series of alkoxy substituted indene derivatives as solubilizing groups for fullerenes. Preliminary experimental results demonstrated that these 5alkoxyindene modified C70 derivatives are superior to widely used PC71BM when blended with poly[N-heptadecanyl-2,7carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) in BHJ solar cells. The device series resistance decreased from 10 cm for the PC71BM based device to 4 cm for the 5-methoxyindene-C70 monoadduct based device. As a result, the device fill factor increased from 0.60 to 0.69, and the overall EQE-calibrated power conversion efficiency was enhanced from 5.6% to 6.2%."

For all devices, poly(3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as the electron donating polymer, in combination with either the fullerene derivative phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in polymer/fullerene cells, CdSe nanoparticles in polymer/nanocrystal cells, or the polyfluorene copolymer poly((9,9‐dioctylfluorene)‐2,7‐diyl‐alt‐[4,7‐bis(3‐hexylthien‐5‐yl)‐2,1,3‐benzothiadiazole]‐2,2‐diyl) (F8TBT) in polymer/polymer cells. Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements are used to probe the dynamics of charge‐separated carriers, with vastly different dynamic behavior observed for polymer/fullerene, polymer/polymer, and polymer/nanocrystal devices on the microsecond to millisecond timescale. Furthermore, by employing transient photocurrent analysis with different applied voltages we are also able to probe the dynamics behavior of these cells from short circuit to open circuit. P3HT/F8TBT and P3HT/CdSe devices are characterized by poor charge extraction of the long‐lived carriers attributed to charge trapping. P3HT/PCBM devices, in contrast, show relatively trap‐free operation with the variation in the photocurrent decay kinetics with applied bias at low intensity, consistent with the drift of free charges under a uniform electric field. Under solar conditions at the maximum power point, we see direct evidence of bimolecular recombination in the P3HT/PCBM device competing with charge extraction. Transient photovoltage measurements reveal that, at open circuit, photogenerated charges have similar lifetimes in all device types, and hence, the extraction of these long‐lived charges is a limiting process in polymer/nanocrystal and polymer/polymer devices."

Oligo(aziridinofullerene)s and low-molecular-weight poly(aziridinofullerene)s (PAFs) are prepared by 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of bis(azidoalkyl) comonomers to C60. The effect of the steric bulk of the comonomer is studied and it is found that PAF solubilities and molecular weights are increased with longer comonomer side-chains. Initial and promising photovoltaic characterizations show commensurate improvements in properties. Interestingly, the PAFs exhibit lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals close to those of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester. Routine characterizations are correlated with DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d) to understand structural and electronic behaviours.

Their electrochemical behaviour and complexation with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were also investigated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of fullerene dumbbells showed high electron affinity, highlighting their ability to interact well with electron-donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which are charge and shape complementary. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and additional information about binding stoichiometries was obtained by NMR titration experiments. Two different approaches were used, resulting in bridged cyclopropane- and furan-based structures. Regardless of the type of linker, all derivatives formed conventional 2:1 complexes [10]CPP2⊃C60 derivative. However, the methano-dumbbell molecules showed different binding behaviour as mono-, bis-pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected.

Quantum chemistry maps the expected electronic behavior of PFs with respect to common electron acceptors, namely fullerene, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester and its bis-adduct, and mono- and bis-indine-fullerene derivatives. Surprisingly, it is found that PFs should demonstrate electron affinities and LUMO energy levels closer to the bis-derivatives than the mono-adducts, even though only one C60 double-bond is used in PF chain formation. A self-consistent library of PFs is synthesized and a correlation between structural characteristics and molecular weights is found. While comonomers with –OC16H33 linear side-chains lead to the highest known ATRAP molecular weights of 21000 g mol−1, like-for-like, branched side-chains permit syntheses of higher molecular weights and more soluble polymers. Of the series, however, PFs with -OC12 side-chains are expected to be of the greatest interest for opto-electronic applications due to their ease of handling and highest regioregularity. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the mechanism behind charge transport in these networks remains unknown. In this study, we developed a Holstein-Peierls Hamiltonian model to investigate charge transport in qHPC60, incorporating both local and non-local electron-phonon couplings. Our computational approach involved identifying suitable semi-empirical parameters to realize the formation of stable polarons in this material. The results unveiled the formation of stable large polarons as the primary carriers in the charge transport throughout qHPC60. To explore polaron transport properties, we conducted dynamic simulations within the picosecond time scale while subjecting the system to an external electric field. Our analysis emphasized the substantial influence of anisotropy on shaping mobile polarons, with an anisotropy coefficient of at least 50%. The polarons exhibited velocities within the acoustic regime ranging from 0.5-1.5 nm ps-1. While these velocities are comparable to those observed in high-end organic molecular crystals, they are considerably lower than those in graphene and conducting polymers. With qHPC60 possessing a semiconducting band gap of approximately 1.6 eV, our findings shed light on its potential application in flat electronics, overcoming the null-gap predicament of graphene."

However, the mechanism that causes these dependencies is not well understood. This work determines how M n and solvent additives affect the performance of BHJ solar cells made with the polymer poly(di(2‐ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b′]dithiophene‐co‐octylthieno[3,4‐c]pyrrole‐4,6‐dione) (PBDTTPD). Low M n PBDTTPD devices have exceedingly large fullerene‐rich domains, which cause extensive charge‐carrier recombination. Increasing the M n of PBDTTPD decreases the size of these domains and significantly improves device performance. PBDTTPD aggregation in solution affects the size of the fullerene‐rich domains and this effect is linked to the dependency of PBDTTPD solubility on M n. Due to its poor solubility high M n PBDTTPD quickly forms a fibrillar polymer network during spin‐casting and this network acts as a template that prevents large‐scale phase separation. Furthermore, processing low M n PBDTTPD devices with a solvent additive improves device performance by inducing polymer aggregation in solution and preventing large fullerene‐rich domains from forming. These findings highlight that polymer aggregation in solution plays a significant role in determining the morphology and performance of BHJ solar cells."
334,10.1039/C3EE43080D,2014.0,Applications of functional fullerene materials in polymer solar cells,"Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) on the basis of polymer:fullerene blends have delivered numerous impressive results in the last decade and thus have drawn much attention of the scientific and industrial communities. However, BHJ PSCs often suffer from several intrinsic problems, such as the low open-circuit voltage (Voc), energetically-unfavorable and chemically-incompatible interfaces, and morphological phase separation of the polymer:fullerene blend driven by thermal treatment, hindering further advancement. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on applications of fullerene-based materials in the BHJ PSCs. Bis-adduct fullerenes possessing high-lying LUMO energy levels can substitute for mono-substituted fullerenes and higher Voc values can thus be achieved. Incorporation of an n-type fullerene interlayer between inorganic and organic active layers in either inverted or conventional PSCs can help in minimization of charge recombination losses at the interface and improvement of charge transfer from the active layer to the inorganic layer, thus resulting in superior PCEs. The optimal active-layer morphology can be maintained through several approaches, such as in situ polymerization of cross-linkable fullerenes, suppression of large-scale PC61BM aggregation by a polyethylene glycol-functionalized fullerene, supramolecular pentafluorophenyl-fullerene stabilization, and light-induced oligomerization of fullerenes. The morphological phase separation of the active-layer materials can thus be minimized. The research of employing fullerene materials will continue playing a critical role in BHJ PSCs. With further investigation and advancement in this field, it is expected that the ultimate goal of commercialization can be realized."

340,10.18910/52068,2015.0,"Fullerene-containing Polymethacrylate : Synthesis, Properties, and Its Potential Application to Organic Photovoltaics","of Thes is An active layer of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) generally comprises of an electron-donor such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) blended with an acceptor material, typically [60]fullerene (C60) and its derivatives. C60 has superior optoelectronic properties such as high electron-acceptability, slow back-electron-transfer, small rearrangement energy, and allow the formation of triplet exciton. However, C60 and its derivatives have some drawbacks: limited solubility, poor morphology and lifetime stability in the blend with the polymeric donor, P3HT. In order to overcome such problems, polymeric acceptors carrying C60 moieties in the side groups of polymethacrylates were designed and synthesized. First, copolymers of 6-chlorohexyl methacrylate, a monomer possessing flexible alkyl spacer, and methyl methacrylate were prepared. The subsequent azidation and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azide yielded polymerthacrylates bearing C60 moieties. Atactic polymethacrylate (at-PF) was prepared by radical polymerization, while syndiotactic (st-PF) and isotactic (it-PF) were obtained by stereospecific anionic polymerization. The controlled molecular weight with narrow distribution by living anionic polymerization allowed the clear observation of molecular weight changes before and after the C60-addition, which revealed a side reaction, i.e. the multi-additions of azides to a C60 moiety, resulting insoluble fractions due to the cross-linking. Nevertheless, the obtained at-PF and st-PF exhibited high solubility in tetrahydrofuran, chloroform and toluene with high C60 content up to 41.4 wt%, which is the highest C60 content among the reported polymethacrylates. In contrast, it-F exhibited relatively low solubility and was only partly soluble in chloroform. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of at-PF and st-PF were comparable to that of soluble C60 derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), enough low to allow charge transfers from P3HT. The results suggest that at-/st-PFs are excellent electron-acceptors for OPVs. This fact was also supported by the almost quantitative fluorescence quenching (94-98%) of the polymers in the blend with P3HT. AFM phase images revealed that the st-PF forms a much finer microphase separation in the blend with P3HT than at-PF, suggesting the control of stereoregularity and molecular weight had significant effects. The OPV devices prepared from the blends of at-/st-PF with P3HT exhibited high open-circuit voltages (Vocs, at-PF: 0.73 V, st-PF: 0.89 V), although the short-circuit currents (Jscs) and fill factors (FFs) were almost zero. The results indicate that the morphology must be improved to achieve bicontinuous percolation network of donor and acceptor materials. Although the electron-acceptor polymers with good photoelectric properties were obtained in the previous chapters, the poor device performance implied the problem of their morphology. A diblock copolymer composed of donor and acceptor segments may form self-assembly of donor and acceptor moieties in nano scales so as to better function as a single molecular device. Toward such a block copolymer, the synthesis and modification block copolymer composed of independently clickable segments were investigated. Anionic copolymerizations of silyl-protected propargyl acrylate and CHMA were conducted in the presence of a bulky aluminum additive. The sequential monomer addition resulted in a relatively wide molecular weight distribution, while the one-shot monomer injection allowed a monomer-selective polymerization to afford block copolymer with narrow molecular weight distribution. The subsequent polymer modification revealed that each segments could be independently functionalized via double click chemistry. This result will provide a facile method for the preparation of block copolymer bearing functional moieties such as an electron-donor and an acceptor for OPV application."
341,10.5185/AMLETT.2013.8532,2014.0,Synthesis and evaluation of swelling characteristics of fullerene (C 60 ) containing cross-linked poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels,Fullerene (C60) containing cross-linked poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) polymers (CFPH) with varying C60 content were synthesized by free radical polymerization. The fullerene content in the cross-linked polymers was determined by TGA analysis. The swelling properties of these fullerene containing hydrogels (CFPH) were studied in distilled water (pH=7.2) at room temperature (25 o C) and compared to the corresponding hydrogel without fullerene (CPHEMA). The equilibrium swelling ratio is lower for the fullerene containing hydrogels (54.68% and 40.0% for hydrogels having 6.0 wt% and 18.0 wt% fullerene respectively) due to the presence of hydrophobic fullerene moieties inside the hydrogels than that of the hydrogel (68.75%) without fullerene. The hydrophobic fullerene nanomaterials acting as inherent nanofillers obstruct the path of water permeation inside the polymers thereby taking more time to achieve equilibrium swelling for fullerene containing hydrogels than that of the hydrogel without fullerene. The kinetics of swelling behavior of such fullerene containing cross-linked hydrogels (CFPH) was observed to follow Fickian behavior. Increase of temperature and ionic strength of the medium decrease the water uptake capacity of the fullerene containing cross-linked hydrogels. Fullerene containing hydrogels may be useful in drug delivery system and other biomedical applications. Copyright © 2014 VBRI press.
342,10.6023/A13101073,2014.0,New Progress in the Device Physics of Polymer-fullerene Solar Cells,"The efficiencies of polymer-fullerene solar cells (PSCs) have now exceeded 10% and are approaching 15% which is the criterion for commercial production. With the increase of the efficiency of organic solar cell, the field has drawn lots of interest. In this review, we present a detailed description on the operating principles of PSCs and an overview of recently developed techniques and new designs that improve the commercial merit of the final product. Firstly, the principles of key steps, including photo-absorption, creation of charge-transfer (CT) state, photocurrent generation and collection, which strongly influence the device performance such as the short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor and overall efficiency are identified, as well as the methods to improve these parameters and the relationship among the work steps of PSC. Theo- retical analysis to the up-to-date experiments leads to the novel descriptions of the photocurrent generation, such as the hot exciton dissociation and non-integer-order recombination. The former one highlights that excess energy of exciton dominates the dissociation yield, and the later one is related to the disorder property of organic solar cells. Secondly, we review advanced techniques for boosting the device performance, which include the employment of inverted structures, plasmonic effects of metal nano-particles, tandem cells and ternary blends. Recent experiments demonstrate proper combinations of these strategies are required to achieve higher efficiencies of PSCs. Comprehensions of device physics in semiconducting polymers is neces- sary to optimize the performance of polymeric solar cells, which would require researches focusing on the synthesis, charac- terization, design and simulation of organic semiconductors. Toward a better understanding of the microscopic working mechanism of high-efficiency PSCs, multi-perspective investigations combined with first-principle calculation such as the density functional theory (DFT) are necessary to provide the detailed information at the donor/acceptor interface.

343,10.1002/cjoc.202300547,2023.0,Semicrystalline Unfused Polymer Donors with Backbone Halogenation Toward Cost‐Effective Organic Solar Cells,"Developing novel unfused building blocks with simple synthesis and low cost is essential to advance and enrich cost‐effective polymer donors; however, it remains a challenge due to the lack of efficient molecular strategies. Herein, a class of low‐cost and fully unfused polymer donors with precisely regulated backbone planarity via halogenation was designed and synthesized, namely PDTBTBz‐2H, PDTBTBz‐2F, and PDTBTBz‐2Cl. These polymer donors possess a four‐step synthesis route with over 80% yield from cheap raw chemicals comparable to existing low‐cost polymer donors, such as PTQ10. Benefitting from the planar backbone via incorporating the F···S non‐covalent interactions, PDTBTBz‐2F exhibits more robust J‐type aggregation in solution and a long‐ranged molecular stacking in film relative to PDTBTBz‐2H and PDTBTBz‐2Cl. Moreover, the systematical study of PDTBTBz‐based Organic solar cells (OSCs) reveals the close relationship between optimized molecular self‐assembly and charge separation/transport regarding backbone halogenation when paired with the non‐fullerene acceptor (Y6‐BO‐4F). As a result, the photovoltaic devices based on semicrystalline PDTBTBz‐2F achieved a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.37%. Our work highlighted the influence of backbone halogenation on the molecular self‐assembly properties and a potential unfused backbone motif for further developing cost‐effective OSCs.This article is protected by copyright.

344,10.1002/ADMA.200601093,2007.0,Device Physics of Polymer:Fullerene Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells,"Plastic solar cells bear the potential for large‐scale power generation based on materials that provide the possibility of flexible, lightweight, inexpensive, efficient solar cells. Since the discovery of the photoinduced electron transfer from a conjugated polymer to fullerene molecules, followed by the introduction of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept, this material combination has been extensively studied in organic solar cells, leading to several breakthroughs in efficiency, with a power conversion efficiency approaching 5 %. This article reviews the processes and limitations that govern device operation of polymer:fullerene BHJ solar cells, with respect to the charge‐carrier transport and photogeneration mechanism. The transport of electrons/holes in the blend is a crucial parameter and must be controlled (e.g., by controlling the nanoscale morphology) and enhanced in order to allow fabrication of thicker films to maximize the absorption, without significant recombination losses. Concomitantly, a balanced transport of electrons and holes in the blend is needed to suppress the build‐up of the space–charge that will significantly reduce the power conversion efficiency. Dissociation of electron–hole pairs at the donor/acceptor interface is an important process that limits the charge generation efficiency under normal operation condition. Based on these findings, there is a compromise between charge generation (light absorption) and open‐circuit voltage (VOC) when attempting to reduce the bandgap of the polymer (or fullerene). Therefore, an increase in VOC of polymer:fullerene cells, for example by raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of the fullerene, will benefit cell performance as both fill factor and short‐circuit current increase simultaneously."

However, these polymers are synthesized through solution-phase reactions to yield insoluble and unprocessable solids, which preclude not only the evaluation of their conducting properties but also the fabrication of thin films for device implementation. Here, we report a strategy for the synthesis of thin films of π-conjugated microporous polymers by designing thiophene-based electropolymerization at the solution–electrode interface. High-quality films are prepared on a large area of various electrodes, the film thickness is controllable, and the films are used for device fabrication. These films are outstanding hole conductors and, upon incorporation of fullerenes into the pores, function as highly efficient photoactive layers for energy conversions.

346,10.1002/anie.202409432,2024.0,Single-Crystal Cage Framework with High Selectivity and Reversibility in Fullerene Binding.,"Host-guest chemistry, a pivotal branch of supramolecular chemistry, plays an essential role in understanding and constructing complex structures through non-covalent interactions. Organic molecular cages, characterized by their intrinsic confined cavities, can selectively bind a variety of guest molecules. Their host-guest chemistry has been well studied in the solution phase, and several attempts have been made to encode well-defined molecular architectures into solid-state polymeric materials. However, only limited studies have explored their potential in the solid state, where their lack of robustness and less ordered networks significantly hinder practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a single-crystal cage framework and a systematic study of its host-guest chemistry, spanning from the solution state to the solid state. Our studies reveal that the host-guest interactions inherent to the cage are successfully maintained in the solid-state polymeric material. Furthermore, the framework's robustness allows for the guest molecules (fullerene) to be released triggered by an organic acid (trifluoracetic acid), with subsequent regeneration of the framework through an organic base (triethylamine) treatment. Our findings represent the first synthesis of a robust, single-crystal cage framework exhibiting highly selective and reversible host-guest chemistry, thus showing great potential towards molecular separation application."
347,10.1039/d1ra03417k,2021.0,Photoactive antimicrobial coating based on a PEDOT-fullerene C60 polymeric dyad,"A photostable and photodynamic antimicrobial surface was successfully obtained and applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This approach was based on the synthesis of a fullerene C60 derivative (EDOT-C60) where fullerene C60 is covalently linked to 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. This dual-functional monomer bears an EDOT center connected via an alkyl chain to a fullerene C60 moiety. In this structure, EDOT acts as an electropolymerizable unit that allows the film formation over conducting substrates, while fullerene C60 performs the photodynamic antimicrobial activity. Electrochemical polymerization of EDOT was used to obtain stable and photodynamic polymeric films (PEDOT-C60) in a controllable procedure. Cyclic voltammetry and UV-visible spectroscopy studies showed that the fullerene C60 units were not altered during the electropolymerization process, obtaining surfaces with high fullerene content. Photobleaching measurements demonstrated that the electropolymerized films were highly photostable. Moreover, photodynamic properties of PEDOT-C60 were compared with fullerene C60 and showed that electrodeposited films were able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the two photomechanisms, producing singlet molecular oxygen (type II) and superoxide radical anion (type I). All studies demonstrated that fullerene C60 moieties covalently attached to the polymeric matrix mainly conserve the photodynamic characteristics. Hence, photodynamic action sensitized by PEDOT-C60 was assessed in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus. The photosensitized inactivation by the electropolymerized films on bacteria suspensions produced >99.9% reduction in S. aureus survival. Fluorescence microscopy experiments with S. aureus adhered to the PEDOT-C60 surface showed a complete microbe annihilation. Also, the eradication of biofilms formed on PEDOT-C60 surfaces resulted in a photokilling >99.9% after visible light irradiation. Our results demonstrated that these antimicrobial photodynamic polymeric films are a promising and versatile platform to photoinactivate microorganisms and to obtain photostable self-sterilizing surfaces."
348,10.1088/1674-4926/43/7/070201,2022.0,Star polymer donors,"Organic solar cells (OSCs) as a promising photovoltaic technology have attracted great attention due to its unique advantages, such as solution processing, low cost, lightweight and excellent mechanical flexibility[1−5]. Conventional OSCs always employ fullerene derivatives, e.g. PC61BM, PC71BM and IC70BA, as electron acceptors. Fullerene derivatives present weak absorption in the visible region, while polymer donors show excellent light-harvesting ability in the visible and even nearinfrared (NIR) regions. Many mediumor low-bandgap polymer donors have been developed for complementary absorption, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for fullerene-based OSCs reach ~12%[6, 7]. In 2015, a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) ITIC was reported by Zhan et al., bringing OSC to a new era. Many efficient NFAs have been developed, and the PCEs of solar cells have soared to ~19%[1, 2]. NFAs always exhibit much low optical bandgap with strong absorption in 600–900 nm, so the development of wide-bandgap (WBG) polymer donors with good light-harvesting ability in 400–700 nm is desirable[8−12]. The pairing of WBG polymer donors and low-bandgap (LBG) NFAs presents reduced voltage loss (Vloss), and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) offset between donor and acceptor can be very small, even close to zero[2, 3]. BDTT is one of the best building blocks in constructing D-A conjugated polymers[13]. The two-dimensional conjugated structure and weak electron-donating ability endow its copolymers with good hole mobilities and low HOMO energy levels. In 2015, Hou et al. reported PM6 (PBDB-TF), and its fullerene solar cells gave a 9.2% PCE (Fig. 1). PM6 offered over 18% PCE when blending with Y-series NFAs[13]. PM6 works very well with most NFAs, and has become one of the best commercial polymer donors. In addition, the chlorinated derivative PM7 (PBDB-TCl) achieved over 17% PCE in PM7:Y6 cells[14]. What's more, some donor or acceptor units as the third component were introduced into PM6. Efficient terpolymer donors were obtained by using random D-A copolymerization to tune the energy levels and absorption. Li et al. introduced an electron-withdrawing unit 2,5-bis(4-(2ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)pyrazine into PM6 backbone to get a D-A1-D-A2 type terpolymer PMZ-10. PMZ-10:Y6 solar cells gave a PCE of 18.23%[15]. In 2020, Ding et al. reported a milestone WBG polymer donor D18 based on DTBT unit with large molecular plane and strong electron-withdrawing capability[1, 16]. D18:Y6 cells offered a PCE of 18.22%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.859 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 27.70 mA/cm2 and a FF of 76.6%, which was the first report on single-junction OSCs with over 18% efficiency[1]. Then, the chlorinated analogue D18-Cl was reported. D18-Cl:N3 cells and D18Cl:N3:PC61BM cells delivered PCEs of 18.13% and 18.69%, respectively[17, 18]. Later, D18-B and D18-Cl-B were also developed via side-chain engineering. D18-B:N3:PC61BM and D18-Cl-B:N3:PC61BM cells offered PCEs of 18.53% and 18.74%, respectively[19]. D18 derivatives have been developed and present good performance[20, 21]. Hou et al. reported two dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline (DTQx)-based polymer donors PBQx-TF and PBQx-TCl with fluorinated or chlorinated BDTT as the donor units[22, 23]. 19.0% and 18.0% PCEs were achieved for PBQx-TF:F-BTA3:eC9-2Cl and PBQx-TCl:BTA3:BTP-eC9 cells, respectively. Very recently, Hou et al. developed a WBG polymer donor PB2F containing fluorinated BDTT and 1,3,4-thiadiazole units with a very deep HOMO level of –5.64 eV. PB2F:PM6:BTP-eC9 cells gave a PCE of 18.6%[24]. The polymer donors mentioned above are based on BDTT donor unit, and they need complex syntheses. Li et al. reported a low-cost polymer donor PTQ10 with thiophene and 6,7-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline units, which was synthesized from commercial materials via a two-step synthesis (yield 87.4%). PTQ10:BTP-FTh:IDIC cells demonstrated a PCE of 19.05%[2]. Currently, most efficient polymer donors are synthesized through multi-step reactions, exhibiting high cost. Cheap and high-performance polymer donors well matching those LBG NFAs are needed[25−30]. We are expecting single-junction OSCs with >20% PCE."
349,10.1103/PhysRevB.82.245207,2010.0,Recombination in polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells,"Recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells reduces the short circuit current (Jsc ) and the fill factor (FF). Identifying the mechanism of recombination is, therefore, fundamentally important for increasing the power conversion efficiency. Light intensity and temperature-dependent current-voltage measurements on polymer BHJ cells made from a variety of different semiconducting polymers and fullerenes show that the recombination kinetics are voltage dependent and evolve from first-order recombination at short circuit to bimolecular recombination at open circuit as a result of increasing the voltage-dependent charge carrier density in the cell. The “missing 0.3 V” inferred from comparison of the band gaps of the bulk heterojunction materials and the measured open-circuit voltage at room-temperature results from the temperature dependence of the quasi-Fermi levels in the polymer and fullerene domains—a conclusion based on the fundamental statistics of fermions."
350,10.1021/nl401044q,2013.0,High-performance perovskite-polymer hybrid solar cells via electronic coupling with fullerene monolayers.,"A plethora of solution-processed materials have been developed for solar cell applications. Hybrid solar cells based on light absorbing semiconducting polymers infiltrated into mesoporous TiO2 are an interesting concept, but generating charge at the polymer-metal oxide heterojunction is challenging. Metal-organic perovskite absorbers have recently shown remarkable efficiencies but currently lack the range of color tunability of organics. Here, we have combined a fullerene self-assembled monolayer (C60SAM) functionalized mesoporous titania, a perovskite absorber (CH3NH3PbI3-xClx), and a light absorbing polymer hole-conductor, P3HT, to realize a 6.7% efficient hybrid solar cell. We find that photoexcitations in both the perovskite and the polymer undergo very efficient electron transfer to the C60SAM. The C60SAM acts as an electron acceptor but inhibits further electron transfer into the TiO2 mesostructure due to energy level misalignment and poor electronic coupling. Thermalized electrons from the C60SAM are then transported through the perovskite phase. This strategy allows a reduction of energy loss, while still employing a ""mesoporous electron acceptor"", representing an exciting and versatile route forward for hybrid photovoltaics incorporating light-absorbing polymers. Finally, we show that we can use the C60SAM functionalization of mesoporous TiO2 to achieve an 11.7% perovskite-sensitized solar cell using Spiro-OMeTAD as a transparent hole transporter."

Together with a profound effect of fluorination on the optical property, nature of charge transport, and molecular organization, F atoms are effective in lowering both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers without a large change in the energy bandgaps. PCDTFBT-based BHJ solar cell shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.96 % with high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.95 V, mainly due to the deep HOMO level (-5.54 eV). To the best of our knowledge, the resulting VOC is comparable to the record VOC values in single junction devices. Furthermore, to our delight, the best PCDTFBT-based device, prepared using 2 % v/v diphenyl ether (DPE) additive, reaches the PCE of 4.29 %. On the other hand, doubly-fluorinated polymer PCDT2FBT shows the only moderate PCE of 2.07 % with a decrease in VOC (0.88 V), in spite of the further lowering of the HOMO level (-5.67 eV) with raising the number of F atoms. Thus, our results highlight that an improvement in efficiency by tuning the energy levels of the polymers by means of molecular design can be expected only if their truly optimized morphologies with fullerene in BHJ systems are materialized."
354,10.1039/c0cp01178a,2011.0,Fullerene derivative acceptors for high performance polymer solar cells.,"Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are composed of a blend film of a conjugated polymer donor and a soluble fullerene derivative acceptor sandwiched between a PEDOT : PSS coated ITO positive electrode and a low workfunction metal negative electrode. The conjugated polymer donor and the fullerene derivative acceptor are the key photovoltaic materials for high performance PSCs. For the acceptors, although [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC(60)BM) and its corresponding C(70) derivative PC(70)BM are dominantly used as the acceptors in PSC at present, several series of new fullerene derivatives with higher-lying LUMO energy level and better solubility were reported in recent years for further improving the power conversion efficiency of the PSCs. In this perspective paper, we reviewed the recent research progress on the new fullerene derivative acceptors, including various PC(60)BM-like C(60) derivatives, PC(60)BM bisadduct, PC(70)BM bisadduct, indene-C(60) bisadduct and indene-C(70) bisadduct, trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes and other C(60) derivatives with multi side chains. The synthesis and physicochemical properties of PC(60)BM and PC(70)BM were also introduced considering the importance of the two fullerene acceptors."

Currently, the most efficient tandem OSCs are fabricated by adopting fullerene derivatives as acceptors. In this work, we designed a new non-fullerene acceptor with an optical band gap (Egopt) of 1.68 eV for the front subcells and optimized the phase-separation morphology of a fullerene-free active layer with an Egopt of 1.36 eV to fabricate the rear subcell. The two subcells show a low energy loss and high external quantum efficiency, and their photoresponse spectra are complementary. In addition, an interconnection layer (ICL) composed of ZnO and a pH-neutral self-doped conductive polymer, PCP-Na, with high light transmittance in the near-IR range was developed. From the highly optimized subcells and ICL, solution-processed fullerene-free tandem OSCs with an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 13% were obtained."
356,10.1021/acs.accounts.5b00199,2015.0,Non-Fullerene Electron Acceptors for Use in Organic Solar Cells,"Conspectus The active layer in a solution processed organic photovoltaic device comprises a light absorbing electron donor semiconductor, typically a polymer, and an electron accepting fullerene acceptor. Although there has been huge effort targeted to optimize the absorbing, energetic, and transport properties of the donor material, fullerenes remain as the exclusive electron acceptor in all high performance devices. Very recently, some new non-fullerene acceptors have been demonstrated to outperform fullerenes in comparative devices. This Account describes this progress, discussing molecular design considerations and the structure–property relationships that are emerging. The motivation to replace fullerene acceptors stems from their synthetic inflexibility, leading to constraints in manipulating frontier energy levels, as well as poor absorption in the solar spectrum range, and an inherent tendency to undergo postfabrication crystallization, resulting in device instability. New acceptors have to address these limitations, providing tunable absorption with high extinction coefficients, thus contributing to device photocurrent. The ability to vary and optimize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level for a specific donor polymer is also an important requirement, ensuring minimal energy loss on electron transfer and as high an internal voltage as possible. Initially perylene diimide acceptors were evaluated as promising acceptor materials. These electron deficient aromatic molecules can exhibit good electron transport, facilitated by close packed herringbone crystal motifs, and their energy levels can be synthetically tuned. The principal drawback of this class of materials, their tendency to crystallize on too large a length scale for an optimal heterojunction nanostructure, has been shown to be overcome through introduction of conformation twisting through steric effects. This has been primarily achieved by coupling two units together, forming dimers with a large intramolecular twist, which suppresses both nucleation and crystal growth. The generic design concept of rotationally symmetrical aromatic small molecules with extended π orbital delocalization, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phthalocyanines, etc., has also provided some excellent small molecule acceptors. In most cases, additional electron withdrawing functionality, such as imide or ester groups, can be incorporated to stabilize the LUMO and improve properties. New calamitic acceptors have been developed, where molecular orbital hybridization of electron rich and poor segments can be judiciously employed to precisely control energy levels. Conformation and intermolecular associations can be controlled by peripheral functionalization leading to optimization of crystallization length scales. In particular, the use of rhodanine end groups, coupled electronically through short bridged aromatic chains, has been a successful strategy, with promising device efficiencies attributed to high lying LUMO energy levels and subsequently large open circuit voltages."
357,10.1039/C1SC00674F,2012.0,Fullerene crystallisation as a key driver of charge separation in polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells,"Solution processed polymer/fullerene blend films are receiving extensive attention as the photoactive layer of organic solar cells. In this paper we report a range of photophysical, electrochemical, physicochemical and structural data which provide evidence that formation of a relatively pure, molecularly ordered phase of the fullerene component, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), may be the key factor driving the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in many of these devices. PCBM crystallisation is shown to result in an increase in its electron affinity, providing an energetic driving force for spatial separation of electrons and holes. Based upon our observations, we propose a functional model applicable to many organic bulk heterojunction devices based upon charge generation in a finely intermixed polymer/fullerene phase followed by spatial separation of electrons and holes at the interface of this mixed phase with crystalline PCBM domains. This model has significant implications for the design of alternative acceptor materials to PCBM for organic solar cells."

359,10.1039/B510618B,2006.0,Morphology of polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells,"Within the different organic photovoltaic devices the conjugated polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction approach is one of the foci of today's research interest. These devices are highly dependent on the solid state nanoscale morphology of the two components (donor/acceptor) in the photoactive layer. The need for finely phase separated polymer–fullerene blends is expressed by the limited exciton diffusion length present in organic semiconductors. Typical distances that these photo-excitations can travel within a pristine material are around 10–20 nm. In an efficient bulk heterojunction the scale of phase separation is therefore closely related to the respective exciton diffusion lengths of the two materials involved. Once the excitons reach the donor/acceptor interface, the photoinduced charge transfer results in the charge separation. After the charges have been separated they require percolated pathways to the respective charge extracting electrodes in order to supply an external direct current. Thus also an effective charge transport relies on the development of a suitable nanomorphology i.e. bicontinuous interpenetrating phase structures within these blend films. The present feature article combines and summarizes the experimental findings on this nanomorphology–efficiency relationship."
360,10.1021/JA305875U,2012.0,Polymer-fullerene miscibility: a metric for screening new materials for high-performance organic solar cells.,"The improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells has generally been achieved through synthetic design to control frontier molecular orbital energies and molecular ordering of the electron-donating polymer. An alternate approach to control the PCE of a BHJ is to tune the miscibility of the fullerene and a semiconducting polymer by varying the structure of the fullerene. The miscibility of a series of 1,4-fullerene adducts in the semiconducting polymer, poly(3-hexylselenophene), P3HS, was measured by dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry using a model bilayer structure. The microstructure of the bilayer was investigated using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission microscopy and linked to the polymer-fullerene miscibility. Finally, P3HS:fullerene BHJ solar cells were fabricated from each fullerene derivative, enabling the correlation of the active layer microstructure to the charge collection efficiency and resulting PCE of each system. The volume fraction of polymer-rich, fullerene-rich, and polymer-fullerene mixed domains can be tuned using the miscibility leading to improvement in the charge collection efficiency and PCE in P3HS:fullerene BHJ solar cells. These results suggest a rational approach to the design of fullerenes for improved BHJ solar cells."
361,10.1021/acsami.2c09323,2022.0,Three Isomeric Non-Fullerene Acceptors Comprising a Mono-Brominated End-Group for Efficient Organic Solar Cells.,"Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) carrying a 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) end-group are the most powerful ones to boost the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the well-known Knoevenagel condensation of the mono-halogenated IC end-group will result in an NFA isomeric effect, a chemical issue that needs to be addressed. Herein, facile preparations and separations of three well-defined mono-brominated isomers BTzIC-2Br-δ, BTzIC-2Br-γ, and BTzIC-2Br-δγ via column chromatography with a well-chosen mixing solvent were demonstrated for Knoevenagel condensation, and their structures were verified by NMR spectra and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra. It is the first time that an asymmetric isomer BTzIC-2Br-δγ is reported, and the regioisomeric effect on optoelectronic properties can be investigated based on all three isomers. Moreover, the single-crystal structure was successfully achieved for the symmetric molecule BTzIC-2Br-γ. With benzodithiophene (BDT)-free PFBT4T-T20 as an easily accessible and low-cost polymer donor, the three isomers could show differentiated device performances, with a power conversion efficiency order of BTzIC-2Br-γ (16.00%) > BTzIC-2Br-δγ (15.81%) > BTzIC-2Br-δ (15.29%). The best efficiency of 16.00% achieved with BTzIC-2Br-γ is among the highest ones for binary OSCs based on the low-cost BDT-free donors. The facile and complete synthesis of isomeric NFAs with mono-halogenated IC end-groups would promote the elucidation of the structure-property relationship."

Among the various non-fullerene PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (APSCs) based on polymer donor-polymer acceptor BHJs have attracted growing attention, due to the following attractions: 1) large and tunable light absorption of the polymer donor/polymer acceptor pair; 2) robustness of the BHJ film morphology; 3) compatibility with large scale/large area manufacturing; 4) long-term stability of the cell to external environmental and mechanical stresses. This Minireview highlights the opportunities offered by APSCs, selected polymer families suitable for these devices with optimization to enhance the performance further, and discusses the challenges facing APSC development for commercial applications."

The electron microscopic images reveal the formation of non-tubular FNWs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern studies indicate the presence of fcc crystalline structure and unusual triclinic structure in the FNWs. The selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) analysis demonstrates the existence of triclinic and electron beam assisted fcc to tetragonal crystalline phase transformation. The formation of triclinic structure might be validated due to the partial polymerization of FNWs at C60 saturated CS2-IPA interface. The high solubility of C60 in CS2 solvent system results in partial polymerization of FNWs. The polymerization of fullerene molecules in the FNWs has been further confirmed using Raman spectroscopy.
365,,2016.0,Synthesis and Modification of Conjugated Materials for Polymer Solar Cells,"Polymer solar cells have emerged as a promising alternative to silicon based solar cells. One of the advantages of polymer solar cells is the possibility to use roll-to-roll techniques for large-scale device production. However, in order to fully utilize this technique, several issues need to be resolved. The bottom electrodes of large-area devices are one critical aspect that typically requires modification with interlayers in order to achieve high performance. The main focus of this thesis has been on the design, synthesis and evaluation of such interfacial materials. In the first part of the thesis, a well performing DPP-based polymer was modified with alkoxy side chains to investigate the effect of various polymer properties. In addition to a redshift in the absorption, other polymer properties were altered, proposing increased flexibility in the polymer chain. The effect of adding an ultrathin layer of an amine-functionalized conjugated polymer between the cathode and active layer in polymer solar cells is studied using four different interlayer polymers. The introduction of these interlayer polymers to the device structure resulted in enhanced solar cell performance due to an improvement in surface and electrical properties of the substrate electrode. In addition, the polymers also improve the photo-stability of devices, mainly as an effect of a reduced decrease in open-circuit voltage and fill factor. Finally, two fullerene derivatives were used to simultaneously achieve both work function modification of the electrode and improved thermal stability of polymer solar cells. The use of fullerene interlayers resulted in higher photovoltaic performance. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance is retained in polymer solar cell blends that otherwise rapidly deteriorate at elevated temperatures."
366,10.1039/c4cp02105c,2014.0,Synthesis and spectroscopic properties of a soluble semiconducting porphyrin polymer.,"A semiconducting porphyrin polymer that is solution processable and soluble in organic solvents has been synthesized, and its spectroscopic and electrochemical properties have been investigated. The polymer consists of diarylporphyrin units that are linked at meso-positions by aminophenyl groups, thus making the porphyrin rings an integral part of the polymer backbone. Hexyl chains on two of the aryl groups impart solubility. The porphyrin units interact only weakly in the ground electronic state. Excitation produces a local excited state that rapidly evolves into a state with charge-transfer character (CT) involving the amino nitrogen and the porphyrin macrocycle. Singlet excitation energy is transferred between porphyrin units in the chain with a time constant of ca. 210 ps. The final CT state has a lifetime of several nanoseconds, and the first oxidation of the polymer occurs at ca. 0.58 V vs. SCE. These properties make the polymer a suitable potential excited state electron donor to a variety of fullerenes or other acceptor species, suggesting that the polymer may find use in organic photovoltaics, sensors, and similar applications."

In recent reports, BHJ solar cells incorporating crystalline or low-bandgap conjugated polymers [ 2 ] and fullerene derivatives have exhibited maximum power conversion effi ciencies (PCEs) of up to 8%. [ 3 ] The morphology [ 4 ] of the active layer in a BHJ solar cell incorporating a polymer/fullerene thin fi lm plays a critical role affecting the device performance; phase-separated domains in the active layer provide not only interfaces for charge separation of photogenerated excitons but also percolation pathways for charge carrier transport to the respective electrodes, critically affecting the device’s PCE. The nanoscale morphology of a polymer/fullerene thin fi lm is greatly affected by (i) the fi lm processing conditions, [ 5 ] (ii) the molar ratio (composition) of the polymer and the fullerene, [ 6 ] and (iii) the nature of the solvent additive (if any). [ 7 ] In particular, BHJ polymer solar cells can exhibit improved device performance after undergoing thermal or solvent annealing or the incorporation of solvent additives, all of which alter the fi lm morphology to a more favorable state relative to that of the as-cast fi lm or the fi lm in the absence of the additive, presumably resulting from (i) self-organization of the polymer units into ordered structures and (ii) appropriate aggregation of fullerene domains to provide percolation networks for charge carrier transport. [ 6 , 8 ] Among these approaches, the addition of solvent additive during the processing of the active layer is the simplest and most effective means of optimizing a BHJ device’s morphology; it infl uences the size of the fullerene domains and enhances the crystallinity of the self-organized polymers by improving the solubility of"
368,10.1039/C6TC05066B,2017.0,Recent progress in non-fullerene small molecule acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs),"Power conversion efficiency (PCE) has surpassed 10% for single junction organic solar cells (OSCs) mainly through the design and synthesis of novel donor materials, the optimization of film morphology and the evolution of the devices. However, the development of novel acceptor materials is relatively sluggish compared with the donor compounds. Nowadays, fullerene derivatives, such as PC61BM and PC71BM, are still the dominant acceptors due to their superior charge transporting properties. Unfortunately, these two acceptors suffer from some intrinsic shortcomings such as limited absorption, difficult functionalization, and high production cost. Therefore, developing novel non-fullerene acceptors that can overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages is highly desirable. As a matter of fact, research on non-fullerene acceptors has made considerable progress in the last two years and a highest PCE of around 12% has been achieved. In this review, we will summarize recent research progress in non-fullerene small molecule acceptors and compare these molecules' performances in OSCs employing the same donor materials. Moreover, the acceptors with excellent photovoltaic performance are highlighted and the reasons are elaborated. Finally, the implications and the challenges are proposed."

To further improve solar cell performance, a thorough understanding of structure-property relationships associated with PTB7/fullerene and related organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is crucial. Traditionally, OPV active layers are viewed as an interpenetrating network of pure polymers and fullerenes with discrete interfaces. Here we show that the active layer of PTB7/fullerene OPV devices in fact involves hierarchical nanomorphologies ranging from several nanometers of crystallites to tens of nanometers of nanocrystallite aggregates in PTB7-rich and fullerene-rich domains, themselves hundreds of nanometers in size. These hierarchical nanomorphologies are coupled to significantly enhanced exciton dissociation, which consequently contribute to photocurrent, indicating that the nanostructural characteristics at multiple length scales is one of the key factors determining the performance of PTB7 copolymer, and likely most polymer/fullerene systems, in OPV devices."

We present a comprehensive morphology and spectroscopy study of this polymer and its blends, focusing on atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and transient absorption spectroscopy on microsecond timescales. Unusually, fullerene-induced ordering is observed, with the polymer/fullerene blend displaying a greater crystallinity compared to the pristine polymer. This was correlated with the appearance of bimodal polarons: fast-decaying polarons in the pristine amorphous polymer domains and trapped polarons localised in the fullerene-induced ordering (crystallline) domains. The lifetime of the trapped polaron was significantly enhanced upon thermal annealing, and the complex relationship observed between lifetime and film crystallinity suggest a contribution from trap states at the interfaces between ordered and disordered domains that lead to inhibited recombination. In contrast, blends incorporating the well-known analogue PffBT4T-2OD (with a shorter alkyl chain length) exhibit neither fullerene-induced ordering nor bimodal polarons. However, both PffBT4T-C9C13 and PffBT4T-2OD polymer blends show clear evidence of polymer triplet formation, which is the first time triplets have been identified in PffBT4T-based blends. In this study, we remark upon the complex relationship between morphology and the photophysics. This relationship will open the door to the synthesis of new molecules to control the blend morphology and thus optimise organic photovoltaic performance."

In this review, we will present an overview of the physical function of organic solar cells, their state-of-the-art performance and limitations, as well as novel concepts to achieve a better material stability and higher power conversion efficiencies. We will also briefly review processing and cost in view of the market potential."
379,,2011.0,Synthesis of a Novel Fullerene End-capped Poly(γ-benzyl L-glutamate),"Fullerene polymers have attracted much attention during the past decade.To explore the synthesis of fullerene polypeptides,a fullerene-γ-benzyl L-glutamate conjugate containing a free amino group was used as an initiator,polymerization of γ-benzyl L-glutamate N-carboxy-anhydride was performed for the first time via ring-opening polymerization,leading to the formation of a novel fullerene end-capped poly(γ-benzyl L-glutamate) with a yield of 37.2%.The product was characterized by 1H NMR,FTIR,UV-Vis,MALDI-TOF MS and thermogravimetric analysis.Compared with previously reported method,this route avoids the utilization of azides and affords the products with relatively identical structures,highlighting its potential application in fullerene polypeptide synthesis."
380,10.1039/C5EE02912K,2016.0,Morphological and electrical control of fullerene dimerization determines organic photovoltaic stability,"Fullerene dimerization has been linked to short circuit current (Jsc) losses in organic solar cells comprised of certain polymer–fullerene systems. We investigate several polymer–fullerene systems, which present Jsc loss to varying degrees, in order to determine under which conditions dimerization occurs. By reintroducing dimers into fresh devices, we confirm that the photo-induced dimers are indeed the origin of the Jsc loss. We find that both film morphology and electrical bias affect the photodimerization process and thus the associated loss of Jsc. In plain fullerene films, a higher degree of crystallinity can inhibit the dimerization reaction, as observed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements. In blend films, the amount of dimerization depends on the degree of mixing between polymer and fullerene. For highly mixed systems with very amorphous polymers, no dimerization is observed. In solar cells with pure polymer and fullerene domains, we tune the fullerene morphology from amorphous to crystalline by thermal annealing. Similar to neat fullerene films, we observe improved light stability for devices with crystalline fullerene domains. Changing the operating conditions of the investigated solar cells from Voc to Jsc also significantly reduces the amount of dimerization-related Jsc loss; HPLC analysis of the active layer shows that more dimers are formed if the cell is held at Voc instead of Jsc. The effect of bias on dimerization, as well as a clear correlation between PL quenching and reduced dimerization upon addition of small amounts of an amorphous polymer into PC60BM films, suggests a reaction mechanism via excitons."

The synthetic route involve 2, 2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) initiated free radical polymerization of vinyl pyridine (VPY) in presence of fullerene [60] (C60) under various conditions in scCO2. This has afforded FPVPC ranging yield (%): 8.08-72.79, C60 content (wt%): 1.35–7.25, and rheoviscosity: 0.20–0.75 (mPaS), respectively. The formation of FPVPC has been ascertained through Uv-vis, FT-IR, 1H-NMR spectra, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Elemental composition of FPVPC has been deduced qualitatively through laser-induced breakdown spectra using a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser emitting at 1,064 nm, with 28 nanoseconds pulse duration as excitation source.

Nanostructured carbon materials are gaining importance due to their high surface area for application in the energy, biotechnology, biomedical, and environmental fields. According to their structures, carbon allotropes are classified as carbon nanodots, carbon nanoparticles, graphene, oxide, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes.

383,10.1002/adfm.201001079,2010.0,Photoinduced Degradation of Polymer and Polymer–Fullerene Active Layers: Experiment and Theory,"As organic photovoltaic efficiencies steadily improve, understanding degradation pathways becomes increasingly important. In this paper, the stability under prolonged illumination of a prototypical polymer:fullerene active layer is studied without the complications introduced by additional layers and interfaces in complete devices. Combining contactless photoconductivity with spectroscopy, structural characterization at the molecular and film level, and quantum chemical calculations, the mechanism of photoinduced degradation in bulk heterojunctions of poly (3‐hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]‐phenyl C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is studied. Bare films are subjected to four conditions for 1000 h with either constant illumination or dark and either ambient or inert atmosphere. All samples are found to be intrinsically stable for 1000+ h under inert conditions, in contrast to complete devices. While PCBM stabilizes P3HT films exposed to air, its fullerene cage is found to undergo a series of oxidations that are responsible for the deterioration of the photoconductivity of the material. Quantum chemical calculations show that PCBM oxides have deeper LUMO levels than pristine PCBM and therefore act as traps for electrons in the PCBM domains."
384,10.1021/ar2002446,2012.0,Molecular design of photovoltaic materials for polymer solar cells: toward suitable electronic energy levels and broad absorption.,"Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) sandwich a blend layer of conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor between a transparent ITO positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode. In comparison with traditional inorganic semiconductor solar cells, PSCs offer a simpler device structure, easier fabrication, lower cost, and lighter weight, and these structures can be fabricated into flexible devices. But currently the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs is not sufficient for future commercialization. The polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors are the key photovoltaic materials that will need to be optimized for high-performance PSCs. In this Account, I discuss the basic requirements and scientific issues in the molecular design of high efficiency photovoltaic molecules. I also summarize recent progress in electronic energy level engineering and absorption spectral broadening of the donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials by my research group and others. For high-efficiency conjugated polymer donors, key requirements are a narrower energy bandgap (E(g)) and broad absorption, relatively lower-lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level, and higher hole mobility. There are three strategies to meet these requirements: D-A copolymerization for narrower E(g) and lower-lying HOMO, substitution with electron-withdrawing groups for lower-lying HOMO, and two-dimensional conjugation for broad absorption and higher hole mobility. Moreover, better main chain planarity and less side chain steric hindrance could strengthen π-π stacking and increase hole mobility. Furthermore, the molecular weight of the polymers also influences their photovoltaic performance. To produce high efficiency photovoltaic polymers, researchers should attempt to increase molecular weight while maintaining solubility. High-efficiency D-A copolymers have been obtained by using benzodithiophene (BDT), dithienosilole (DTS), or indacenodithiophene (IDT) donor unit and benzothiadiazole (BT), thienopyrrole-dione (TPD), or thiazolothiazole (TTz) acceptor units. The BDT unit with two thienyl conjugated side chains is a highly promising unit in constructing high-efficiency copolymer donor materials. The electron-withdrawing groups of ester, ketone, fluorine, or sulfonyl can effectively tune the HOMO energy levels downward. To improve the performance of fullerene derivative acceptors, researchers will need to strengthen absorption in the visible spectrum, upshift the LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level, and increase the electron mobility. [6,6]-Phenyl-C(71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC(70)BM) is superior to [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) because C(70) absorbs visible light more efficiently. Indene-C(60) bisadduct (ICBA) and Indene-C(70) bisadduct (IC(70)BA) show 0.17 and 0.19 eV higher LUMO energy levels, respectively, than PCBM, due to the electron-rich character of indene and the effect of bisadduct. ICBA and IC(70)BA are excellent acceptors for the P3HT-based PSCs."

It is found that, while no intercalation occurs in P3HT crystals, amorphous portions of P3HT and MDMO-PPV contain significant concentrations of PCBM, calling into question models based on pure phases and discrete interfaces. Furthermore, depth profiles of P3HT/PCBM bilayers reveal that even short annealing causes significant interdiffusion of both materials, showing that under no conditions do pure am..."

A very strong increase of the device performance was observed by simply switching from the racemic to the enantiopure forms of these  -helical non-fullerene acceptors with power conversion efficiencies jumping from 0.4% to ca 2.0% in air-processed poly( 3-hexylthiophene ) based devices, thus highlighting the key role of enantiopurity in the photovoltaic while the surface of rac- 2:P3HT blend shows larger coarse domains on the micrometer scale, resulting in a roughness value five times higher in the case of rac- 2 (8 nm) than in P and M - 2 based active layers (1.5 nm). In summary, we have investigated the impact of enantiopurity on the performance of photovoltaic devices by comparing racemic and enantiopure naphthalimide end-capped [6]helicenes as electron acceptors, blended with P3HT donor polymer in OSCs. In this proof of concept, a 5–fold increase of the cells efficiency was recorded going from the racemic to the enantiomerically pure electron acceptor based inverted OSCs. This significant difference was attributed to a different organization of the enantiopure compounds in the solid state, affecting both the charge transport properties and the morphology within in the active layers, resulting in better photovoltaic efficiencies. More than highlighting the potential of helicenes in OPVs, as a new class of NFAs displaying both extended  -conjugation and inherent chirality, this work also suggests that chirality may in some cases have a strong impact on the photovoltaic performance if present within the active layer of a Unprecedented enantiopurity impact on OPV performance was observed with racemic and enantiomerically pure naphthalimide end-capped helicenes as non-fullerene molecular electron acceptors.

This Perspective provides a brief description of recent progress in this scientific discipline. The conceptual evolution leading to the discovery of these NTs and NPs is briefly discussed. Subsequently, recent progress in the synthesis of such NPs from a variety of inorganic compounds with layered (2D) structure is described. In particular, we discuss the synthesis of NTs from chalcogenide- and oxide-based ternary misfit layered compounds, as well as their structure and different growth mechanisms. Next we deliberate on the mechanical, optical, electrical, and electromechanical properties, which delineate them from their bulk counterparts and also from their graphene-like analogues. Here, different experiments with individual NTs coupled with first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations demonstrate the unique physical nature of these quasi-1D nanostructures. Finally, the various applications of the fullerene-like NPs of WS2 and NTs formed therefrom are deliberated. Foremost among the possibilities are their extensive uses as superior solid lubricants. Combined with their nontoxicity and their facile dispersion, these NTs, with an ultimate strength of about 20 GPa, are likely to find numerous applications in reinforcing polymers, adhesives, textiles, medical devices, metallic alloys, and even concrete. Other potential applications in energy-harvesting and catalysis are discussed in brief."

The need for blending the two components is based on the idea that the exciton diffusion length in polymers like P3HT is only ∼10 nm, so that the polymer and fullerene components must be mixed on this length scale to efficiently split the excitons into charge carriers. In this paper, we show that the BHJ geometry is not necessary for high efficiency, and that all-solution-processed P3HT/PCBM bilayer solar cells can be nearly as efficient as BHJ solar cells fabricated from the same materials. We demonstrate that o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and dichloromethane serve nicely as a pair of orthogonal solvents from which sequential layers of P3HT and PCBM, respectively, can be spin-cast.

The intercalated blends, which exhibit optimal solar-cell performance at 1:4 polymer:fullerene by weight, have better photoluminescence quenching and lower absorption than the nonintercalated blends, which optimize at 1:1.

395,10.1039/B813368A,2009.0,Synthesis and photophysical property of well-defined donor–acceptor diblock copolymer based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) and fullerene,"A new, well-defined diblock copolymer (P3HT-b-C60) based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene was synthesized. First, regioregular P3HT was synthesized through Grignard metathesis polymerization, and then methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) were copolymerized by using an end-functionalized P3HT as a macroinitiator for the atom transfer radical polymerization to yield a diblock copolymer (P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA)). A fullerene derivative functionalized with carboxylic acid, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA), was then chemically linked to the HEMA unit in the second block (P(MMA-r-HEMA)) to produce a diblock copolymer with the second block containing fullerenes. Annealing thin films of the copolymer revealed nanometer-scale phase separation, a more suitable morphology for enabling excitons generated in the P3HT domain to more efficiently reach the donor–acceptor interface, relative to simple blends of P3HT and C60. As a result, photoluminescence of the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer in the films showed a complete quenching of photoluminescence of P3HT, which is indicative of charge transfer between P3HT and fullerene."

401,10.1002/adma.200701519,2008.0,Controlling Morphology in Polymer–Fullerene Mixtures,"In the past several years, polymer–fullerene mixtures have been intensely studied for use in organic solar cells because they can be deposited from solution, are compatible with lowcost roll-to-roll fabrication technology, and have shown high power conversion efficiency (g), up to 4–5%. The best devices consist of a single bulk-heterojunction active layer, in which the polymer (donor) and fullerene (acceptor) are deposited from a common solvent. As the solvent dries the donor and acceptor components separate into domains. The final efficiency of the solar cell has been shown to be extremely sensitive to the size, composition, and crystallinity of the formed domains. Improvement of the morphology in devices fabricated with a mixture of [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been achieved by using heat-treatment techniques and long-time solvent curing, with resulting record efficiencies. More recently, a method for increasing the crystallinity of the P3HT component has been introduced which involves filtering preformed nanofibers of P3HT out of solution and mixing the prepared nanofiber dispersion with PCBM to increase the efficiency of as-cast devices. Interestingly, the best device performance was achieved by mixing lower-molecular-weight (MW) amorphous P3HT back into the solution to reduce the crystalline content of the active layer and, thereby, to increase connection between crystalline domains. Studies of the MW impact on P3HT/PCBM solar cells have indicated that a large polydispersity and number-average molecular weight (Mn) over 19000 g mol -1 leads to improved efficiency. Morphology studies of organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices indicate that the increased MW leads to better network formation between crystalline domains. The morphology of these improved devices has been studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), NMR, and a variety of other optical and electrical techniques. The morphology studies give a picture of a device in which the P3HT forms aligned/crystalline domains, between which are amorphous segments of P3HT and PCBM. These domains form with larger size and crystallinity for higher heat-treatment temperatures and longer solvent soaking times. Depending on the fabrication and measurement techniques, the aligned domains of P3HT are depicted as fibers or as shapeless masses. The majority of these studies do not, however, allow quantification of the percentage of the P3HT that is agglomerated/ crystalline in the final device. Only by making use of the nanofiber filtration technique have the authors been given the ability to control the crystalline content of the P3HT in solution and in the final device. The disadvantages of this technique are the necessity of more complicated preparation, and filtered P3HT is restricted to a fibrous form that requires the addition of amorphous P3HT to provide connections between crystalline domains. We present here a simple method to determine the agglomerated–amorphous ratio of the P3HT and to control the degree of agglomeration/crystallinity of the P3HT in the final device by using a solvent mixing method and no further heat-treatment or prepreparation of the polymer. The most obvious change that heat-treatment and solvent soaking yield on a P3HT:PCBM layers is the change in color. It has been widely reported that the P3HT absorption red-shifts and a series of vibronic peaks become visible at k ∼ 600 nm, 550 nm, and 510 nm. This red-shift has been assigned to increased planarization and stabilization of the P3HT chains that accompanies self-stacking of the polymer. The crystal structure for these self-stacking domains has been solved by using XRD and TEM, and shows a herringbone interconnection of the alkyl chains and an a-dimension stacking distance of 1.6 nm. The p–p chain stacking of the P3HT chains in crystallites has been measured to be 0.38 nm. The herringbone structure and planarization of the P3HT with heating has been confirmed using heteronuclear solid-state NMR measurements. The red-shift in the UV-vis spectrum occurs proportionally to the degree of agglomeration of the P3HT. The pure amorphous electronic spectrum of P3HT or a mixture of P3HT and PCBM is simple to measure. A solution UV-vis spectrum can also be measured in the liquid state. If C O M M U N IC A TI O N"

The process of in situ polymerization was monitored at different concentrations (mol/dL) of AIBN (304.50–761.25 × 10−3) and MMA (9.41–23.53 × 10−3), and temperatures (60°–90°C), pressures (1400–2000 psi), and time (2–8 h). The progress of in situ polymerization was monitored rheoviscometrically in tetrahydrofuran at 25 ± 1°C. Selected [60] fullerene-PMMA conjugates were characterized through UV-vis, GPC, FT-IR, 1HMMR, 13CNMR spectra, and thermal characterization by TG."

405,10.1021/ja502985g,2014.0,Importance of the donor:fullerene intermolecular arrangement for high-efficiency organic photovoltaics.,"The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) material systems are hypothesized to depend strongly on the intermolecular arrangements at the donor:fullerene interfaces. A review of some of the most efficient polymers utilized in polymer:fullerene PV devices, combined with an analysis of reported polymer donor materials wherein the same conjugated backbone was used with varying alkyl substituents, supports this hypothesis. Specifically, the literature shows that higher-performing donor-acceptor type polymers generally have acceptor moieties that are sterically accessible for interactions with the fullerene derivative, whereas the corresponding donor moieties tend to have branched alkyl substituents that sterically hinder interactions with the fullerene. To further explore the idea that the most beneficial polymer:fullerene arrangement involves the fullerene docking with the acceptor moiety, a family of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione polymers (PBDTTPD derivatives) was synthesized and tested in a variety of PV device types with vastly different aggregation states of the polymer. In agreement with our hypothesis, the PBDTTPD derivative with a more sterically accessible acceptor moiety and a more sterically hindered donor moiety shows the highest performance in bulk-heterojunction, bilayer, and low-polymer concentration PV devices where fullerene derivatives serve as the electron-accepting materials. Furthermore, external quantum efficiency measurements of the charge-transfer state and solid-state two-dimensional (2D) (13)C{(1)H} heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) NMR analyses support that a specific polymer:fullerene arrangement is present for the highest performing PBDTTPD derivative, in which the fullerene is in closer proximity to the acceptor moiety of the polymer. This work demonstrates that the polymer:fullerene arrangement and resulting intermolecular interactions may be key factors in determining the performance of OPV material systems."

Different oxidants such as ferric chloride (FeCl3) and ammonium persulphate (N2H8S2O8) and surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (C12H25NaO4S) were used. The produced PPy samples were characterized by using different techniques such as the electrical resistivity by four probe technique, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The performance of the oxidants has been investigated and compared. It was found that both oxidants, FeCl3 and N2H8S2O8, have decreased electrical resistivity as a function of temperature, which means increased conductivity. However, FeCl3 has achieved better performance than N2H8S2O8, where it has achieved a lower resistivity of about 60 ohms at room temperature, which indicates higher conductivity of PPy samples with FeCl3 as an oxidant. Similarly, further investigation of FeCl3 oxidant has been conducted by varying its concentration, and its influence on the final properties was reported. It has been observed that the morphology of PPy samples has a significant influence on the conductivity. It was found that 0.1 M and 0.05 M concentrations of FeCl3 oxidant and monomer, respectively, have achieved better thermal stability, which is FeCl3/mPPy ratio of 2 as an optimum value. FTIR and XRD results confirmed the structural formation of polypyrrole from pyrrole monomer during the synthesizing process."

Electron hole recombination in this state results in a luminescent transition at 840nm, energetically separated from the polymer emission. This transition can be directly photoexcited by tuning the excitation energy below the conjugated polymer bandgap, demonstrating that the charge-transfer state originates from a ground-state interaction. By electric field induced quenching of the photoluminescence, we determine a binding energy of 130meV for excitons in the charge-transfer state."

Polymer-based organic photovoltaic systems hold the promise for a cost-effective, lightweight solar energy conversion platform, which could benefit from simple solution processing of the active layer. The function of such excitonic solar cells is based on photoinduced electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor. Fullerenes have become the ubiquitous acceptors because of their high electron affinity and ability to transport charge effectively. The most effective solar cells have been made from bicontinuous polymer–fullerene composites, or so-called bulk heterojunctions. The best solar cells currently achieve an efficiency of about 5 %, thus significant advances in the fundamental understanding of the complex interplay between the active layer morphology and electronic properties are required if this technology is to find viable application."

Several fullerene and tris(bipyridine)ruthenium dual end-functionalized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) metallopolymers were prepared using three successive reactions involving a living radical polymerization, an end-group transformation, and a metal–ligand complexation. Initially, the bipyridine end-fuctionalized PNIPAM polymers were prepared by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide using a bipyridine-functionalized RAFT agent. The terminal groups (Ph–CS–S–) of the RAFT-prepared PNIPAM polymers were transformed into C60 end-groups by their reactions with C60 in the presence of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The bipyridine end-groups of the fullerene end-functionalized PNIPAM macroligands were finally complexed with ruthenium ions to produce well-defined fullerene and ruthenium dual end-functionalized PNIPAM thermosensitive metallopolymers. The detailed molecular characterization of these products and their precursors confirmed the composition and structure of these new metallopolymers. This modular strategy represents a new, straightforward, and versatile methodology for the preparation of new fullerene-monotelechelic macroligands and metallopolymers."

We perform complementary measurements on solid‐state blends of poly[2‐methoxy‐5‐(3,7‐dimethyloctyloxy)]‐1,4‐phenylenevinylene (MDMO‐PPV) and the soluble fullerene C60 derivative 1‐(3‐methoxycarbonyl) propyl‐1‐phenyl [6,6]C61 (PCBM), spin‐cast from either toluene or chlorobenzene solutions. The characterization of the nanomorphology is carried out via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), while solar‐cell devices were characterized by means of current–voltage (I–V) and spectral photocurrent measurements. In addition, the morphology is manipulated via annealing, to increase the extent of phase separation in the thin‐film blends and to identify the distribution of materials. Photoluminescence measurements confirm the demixing of the materials under thermal treatment. Furthermore the photoluminescence of PCBM clusters with sizes of up to a few hundred nanometers indicates a photocurrent loss in films of the coarser phase‐separated blends cast from toluene. For toluene‐cast films the scale of phase separation depends strongly on the ratio of MDMO‐PPV to PCBM, as well as on the total concentration of the casting solution. Finally we observe small beads of 20–30 nm diameter, attributed to MDMO‐PPV, in blend films cast from both toluene and chlorobenzene."

A transparent titanium oxide (TiOx) layer separates and connects the front cell and the back cell. The TiOx layer serves as an electron transport and collecting layer for the first cell and as a stable foundation that enables the fabrication of the second cell to complete the tandem cell architecture. We use an inverted structure with the low band-gap polymer-fullerene composite as the charge-separating layer in the front cell and the high band-gap polymer composite as that in the back cell.

413,,2009.0,"Synthesis and characterization of molecular materials derived from dendrimers, [60]fullerene, and linear π-conjugated oligomers","This thesis reports the studies of a series of novel π-conjugated organic hybrid materials undertaken throughout my PhD research. In the synthetic work, the Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne [3+2] cycloaddition, one of the most popular click reactions, has been successfully utilized to covalently attach a series of azido-pendant Frechet-type dendrimers to various alkynylated π-conjugated building-blocks, ranging from [60]fullerene, porphyrin, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) analogues, and linear/star-shaped conjugated phenylene ethynylene oligomers (OPEs), in a modular fashion. The resulting hybrid macromolecules show rich photophysical, electrochemical, and surface morphological properties, which are potentially useful for the application in molecular optoelectronic devices. The most remarkable finding resulting from the ""click synthesis"" comes from a class of dendro[60]fullerenes, which show interesting surface self-assembly behavior to form controllable nanostructures. The correlation between aggregation behavior and molecular parameters has been examined, and the results indicate that the surface self-assembling properties of these dendro[60]fullerenes are dependent on dendron generation, the nature of the end-groups, and acidity. Moreover, a class of electron-rich polyynes has been synthesized, in which redox active 1,3-dithiole and ferrocenyl end groups are incorporated into the polyynes. Potential of these polyyne-TTF hybrids in making electrochemically active conducting polymer materials has been explored based on voltammetric and spectroscopic characterization. Finally, the thesis work has developed the synthesis of a series of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalized conjugated arylene polymers as well as a group of imidazolium-based ionic liquids. These materials are specially designed for functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) through non-covalent and covalent approaches."
414,10.1088/0957-4484/15/9/035,2004.0,Influence of nanomorphology on the photovoltaic action of polymer–fullerene composites,"Composites of conjugated poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) demonstrate an efficient photogeneration of mobile charge carriers. Thermal annealing of P3HT:PCBM based devices gives rise to a significant increase of the photovoltaic efficiency, as follows from measurements of the external quantum efficiency and the current-voltage characteristics. Upon annealing, the absorption spectrum of the P3HT:PCBM composite undergoes a strong modification, whereas in the pure components it remains unchanged. The absorption of the annealed blends becomes stronger and red shifted in the wavelength region ascribed to P3HT, while the absorption due to the PCBM contribution does not change. Atomic force microscope measurements on P3HT:PCBM disclose some variation in morphology due to the crystallization of PCBM. The concentration of the PCBM clusters and their size (up to 500 nm) were found to be correlated with the amount of PCBM in the blend. We have studied the performance of photovoltaic devices with different weight ratios of P3HT:PCBM, namely, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1.5, 1:1, 1:0.9, 1:0.8, and 1:0.7. The photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency showed a maximum between 1:1 and 1:0.9. We conclude the variation in the absorption spectrum and the red shift to result from molecular diffusion of PCBM out of the polymer matrix upon annealing. The growth of the PCBM clusters leads to formation of percolation paths and, therefore, improves the photocurrent. Above a certain concentration, the PCBM crystals provide mechanical stress on the metal electrode, therefore possibly damaging the interface. Optimization of the composite weight ratio reveals the important role played by morphology for the transport properties of bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM based solar cells."

As compared to a control device with only C60, the addition of SWCNTs resulted in an improvement of both the short circuit current density JSC and the fill factor (FF). This device takes advantage of the electron accepting feature of C60 and the high electron transport capability of SWCNTs.

The chemically modified pendant C60/i-PP polymers are soluble in chlorinated solvents and have been characterized by ultraviolet–visible and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, cyclic voltametry, and thermogravimetric analysis. From the results it can be concluded that the modification of i-PP by grafting via a free-radical reaction competes with the possibility of chain scission of i-PP due to the presence of DCP. The functionalized polymers crystallize in the monoclinic crystal modification, and have high crystallinity. The incorporation of C60 significantly enhances the thermal stability of the i-PP.

417,10.1088/1674-4926/42/8/080301,2021.0,All-polymer solar cells,"Organic solar cells (OSCs) show a promising commercialization prospect with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 18%[1−6]. Among various types of OSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) with a physical blend of pand ntype polymer as the active layer to harvest solar irradiation attract growing attention due to their unique advantages like excellent morphological stability, and mechanical durability[7]. Recently, great progresses have been achieved in this field including the development of high-performance polymer acceptors and the advances in morphology regulation[8−13]. Particularly, a PCE of 17.20% has been realized very recently by allPSCs via properly aligned energy levels and optimal active-layer morphology[8]. This achievement has significantly reduced the PCE gap between all-PSCs and small molecular acceptorbased OSCs, indicating the bright future of all-PSCs. Therefore, a highlight on these important progresses is timely and will effectively drive the development of all-PSCs. In the early stage, the electron acceptors employed in allPSCs were mainly dominated by perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) polymers[7, 14−18]. Specifically, an NDI-based polymer with a trade name of N2200 (Fig. 1) is the most widely used electron acceptor in all-PSCs[19−22]. This polymer was initially reported by Facchetti et al. in 2009, which exhibited appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (~–4.0 eV) and high electron mobility (~10–3 cm2/(V·s))[23]. Through delicate optimization of the active-layer morphology, the highest PCE of all-PSCs with N2200 reached 11.76%, which is comparable to that of fullerenebased OSCs[22]. However, further efficiency improvement of N2200-based all-PSCs was hampered by the limited short-circuit current density (Jsc). This is caused by the low external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the long wavelength region due to the low absorption coefficient (~3 × 104 cm–1 at 700 nm) of N2200. Besides, NDI-based polymers usually lead to the formation of large domains in active layer due to the strong aggregation ability of NDI-based polymers. Considerable efforts were thus devoted to regulate the morphology of the active layer of all-PSCs with NDI polymers. The reported morphology optimization strategies span from chemistry (such as side chain functionalization, co-monomer selection, ternary copolymerization, etc.)[24−27] to physics (such as the selection of matched donors, solvent optimization, post-treatment by thermal annealing or solvent annealing, etc.)[28−31]. An important advantage of NDI-based polymers is that they can afford very stable devices[32−34], which makes them a class of promising polymer acceptors should the device efficiency can be further improved. To overcome the drawbacks associated with NDIand PDI-based polymers, a few n-type polymers with donor–acceptor alternating skeleton were thus developed for use as electron acceptors in all-PSCs[35−39]. In 2015, Liu and co-workers reported a polymer acceptor featuring boron-nitrogen coordination bond (B←N) for all-PSCs[35], which offered high open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the high-lying LUMO energy level. After that, a few polymer acceptors based on B←N coordination bond with superior optoelectronic properties were developed[40]. For example, PBN-12 (Fig. 1) afforded a decent PCE of 10.1% and a high Voc of 1.17 V benefitting from the high LUMO level of the polymer[37]. However, this polymer suffered from narrow light absorption range due to the large optical bandgap of 1.78 eV. As a result, the Jsc of the best allPSCs with PBN-12 only reached 13.39 mA/cm2. Guo group developed a donor–acceptor alternating narrow-bandgap polymer acceptor (DCNBT-IDT, Fig. 1) based on the electron-deficient unit 5,6-dicyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DCNBT), possessing an optical bandgap of 1.43 eV[38]. The all-PSCs with DCNBT-IDT offered a decent PCE of 8.32% when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T. By copolymerizing DCNBT with a stronger electron-rich monomer, the resulting polymer DCNBT-TPIC (Fig. 1) further extended the light absorption onset to 970 nm and obtained a maximum absorption coefficient of ~7.5 × 104 cm–1[39]. As a result, the best all-PSC with DCNBT-TPIC gave a PCE of 10.22% with a Jsc of 22.52 mA/cm2. However, the fill factor (FF) of all-PSCs with DCNBT-IDT or DCNBT-TPIC was ~0.65, which restricted the overall device performance. Encouragingly, an FF of 0.74 was achieved by DCNBTIDT via a delicate design of ternary blend and p-doping the polymer donor with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ), yielding a remarkable PCE of 11.87%[41]. These results demonstrated the potential of DCNBT-based polymers for high-performance all-PSCs. The leap-forward advance of all-PSCs should be attributed to the strategy of the polymerization of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (Fig. 1)[42, 43]. This kind of polymers (PSMAs) retain the merits of their parent small molecular acceptors including narrow optical bandgap, high light absorption coefficient, suitable energy levels, and high charge mobility[44]. This strategy was first reported by Li group in 2017 with the synthesis of PZ1 (Fig. 1), which is a polymer of A–D–A type small molecular acceptor IDIC[42, 45]. Impressively,"

This article provides an overview on fullerene containing polymers, from synthesis to their physicochemical properties in solution. Due to the unique chemical structure of fullerene, different fullerene containing polymeric architecture can be synthesized through various kinds of conjugating techniques, where fullerene can be located either on the backbone or the branch chain. Recently, the successful development of azido coupling and atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) makes it possible to synthesize ""controlled"" and well-defined fullerene containing polymers. Experimental results indicated that fullerene containing polymers not only increase the solubility of fullerene in solution, but also retain the conjugating properties of fullerene molecules. By blocking well-defined functional polymers onto fullerene molecules, different types of stimuli-responsive amphiphilic systems can be achieved. However, the large bulk volume and high hydrophobicity of fullerene gives rise to the large aggregates with different morphologies produced in solution, which can be tuned by changing external stimuli, such as pH, temperature, salt, and co-solvents. Interestingly, fullerene containing anionic polymers could induce the formation nano-scale fractal pattern, but not fullerene containing cationic polymers, which is evident from morphological studies."

The quantitative microstructural analysis after covalent attachment of the bulky C60 moiety to the PVC has been followed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. From the results it can be concluded that the modification of PVC by graft reaction through free radical reaction proceeds by a stereoselective mechanism. This conclusion has been confirmed on the basis of the increase of the glass-transition temperature (Tg) and the thermal stability of the C60-chemical modified PVC samples.

The electronic band gap of organic semiconductors can be engineered by chemical synthesis for simple color changing of light emitting diodes (LEDs).5 Charge carrier mobilities as high as 10 cm2/V‚s6 made them competitive with amorphous silicon.7 This review is organized as follows. In the first part, we will give a general introduction to the materials, production techniques, working principles, critical parameters, and stability of the organic solar cells. In the second part, we will focus on conjugated polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells, mainly on polyphenylenevinylene (PPV) derivatives/(1-(3-methoxycarbonyl) propyl-1-phenyl[6,6]C61) (PCBM) fullerene derivatives and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/PCBM systems. In the third part, we will discuss the alternative approaches such as polymer/polymer solar cells and organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells. In the fourth part, we will suggest possible routes for further improvements and finish with some conclusions. The different papers mentioned in the text have been chosen for didactical purposes and cannot reflect the chronology of the research field nor have a claim of completeness.

429,10.1103/PHYSREVB.59.15346,1999.0,EXCITON DIFFUSION AND DISSOCIATION IN CONJUGATED POLYMER/FULLERENE BLENDS AND HETEROSTRUCTURES,We investigate the exciton dynamics in composite systems of conjugated polymers and fullerene molecules by photoluminescence ~PL! and femtosecond transient absorption experiments. In solid mixtures ~blends! we find a strong concentration-dependent quenching of the polymer PL. This is attributed to an efficient electron transfer ~ET! from the photoexcited conjugated polymer to the fullerene. The ET dynamics is directly monitored by measuring the transient stimulated emission of the conjugated polymer. The transfer rate depends linearly on the C60 concentration and ranges between (66 ps) 21 and (5 ps) 21 for concentrations from 0.5% to 5%. This dependence is in accordance with an exciton diffusion process occurring prior to the ET. The exciton diffusion length in the conjugated polymer is directly determined by measuring the PL quenching in welldefined heterostructures comprising a self-assembled fullerene monolayer and a thin spin-coated polymer layer of variable thickness. From these measurements we infer a value of 14 nm for the exciton diffusion length in ladder-type poly ~p-phenylene!. Our results are of direct relevance for further optimization of polymer photovoltaic devices. @S0163-1829~99!07923-0#
430,10.1039/B505361G,2005.0,Stabilization of the nanomorphology of polymer–fullerene “bulk heterojunction” blends using a novel polymerizable fullerene derivative,"The morphological stabilization of donor–acceptor blends for bulk heterojunction solar cells can be achieved by cross-linking of the small molecular phase in the polymer matrix using a polymerizable fullerene derivative. In a comparative study the morphology of polymer–fullerene blend films was investigated using poly(3-hexylthiophene) 
 (P3HT) as the polymer and C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or the newly synthesized polymerizable fullerene derivative, C61-butyric acid glycidol ester, PCBG, as the acceptor molecule, respectively. Changes in the nanomorphology due to heat treatment of the films were studied by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence (PL) studies. The polymerization process was monitored with infrared absorption studies. As demonstrated by these comparative studies this newly synthesized fullerene gives considerable stabilization of the solid state morphology in these blends. Such prevention of the long term, high temperature instability of bulk heterojunction morphology displays an important route to increase the operational stability of plastic solar cells in future applications."

432,10.1063/1.1412270,2001.0,Temperature dependence for the photovoltaic device parameters of polymer-fullerene solar cells under operating conditions,"We report on the temperature dependence of various photovoltaic device parameters of solar cells, fabricated from interpenetrating networks of conjugated polymers with fullerenes, in the wide temperature range of their possible operating conditions ~25‐ 60 °C!. The open-circuit voltage was found to decrease linearly with increasing temperature. For the short-circuit current, we observed a monotonic increase with increasing temperature, followed by a saturation region. The rate of this increase ~coupled to a corresponding increase for the fill factor! was found to overtake the corresponding rate of decrease in voltage, resulting in an overall increase of the energy conversion efficiency. The efficiency was observed to reach a maximum value in the approximate range 47‐ 60 °C.

433,10.1021/JA00029A058,1992.0,"Synthesis and characterization of C60O, the first fullerene epoxide","The isolation of C{sub 60} in preparatively useful quantities has stimulated intensive efforts to generate and characterize functional derivatives. Many reactions of C{sub 60} furnish complex, inseparable mixtures of products, and only a few discrete, monofunctional congeners have been described to date. We now report that photooxidation of C{sub 60} in benzene furnishes a single monooxide, C{sub 60}O, as the sole isolable product. Moreover, we have obtained the same species as a byproduct of the synthesis of C{sub 60}. Spectroscopic analysis strongly supports the epoxide structure. It is demonstrated that C{sub 60}O is efficiently converted to C{sub 60} in a 91% yield during chromatography of neutral alumina. The widespread use of alumina for purification of the fullerenes may explain why the fullerene oxide was not isolated before."
434,10.1021/JA9602408,1996.0,"Bulk Synthesis of Inorganic Fullerene-like MS2 (M = Mo, W) from the Respective Trioxides and the Reaction Mechanism","Recently, milligram quantities of MoS2 fullerene-like nanotubes and negative curvature polyhedra (generically called inorganic fullerene-like material, IF), were reproducibly obtained by a gas phase reaction from an oxide precursor (Feldman, Y.; Wasserman, E.; Srolovitz, D. J.; Tenne, R. Science 1995, 267, 222. Srolovitz, D. J.; Safran, S. A.; Homyonfer, M.; Tenne, R. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1995, 74, 1778). The present work focuses on the mechanism of the synthesis of IF-MS2 (M = W, Mo). The IF material is obtained from oxide particles smaller than ca. 0.2 μm, while larger oxide particles result in 2H-MS2 platelets. The key step in the reaction mechanism is the formation of a closed layer of MS2, which isolates the nanoparticle from its surroundings and prevents its fusion into larger particles. Subsequently, the oxide core of the nanoparticle is progressively converted into a sulfide nanoparticle with an empty core (IF). Taking advantage of this process, we report here a routine for the fabrication of macrosco..."

Various applications for such nanomaterials were proposed. For instance, IF-WS(2) nanoparticles were shown to have beneficial effects as solid lubricants and as part of tribological surfaces. Further applications of IF for high-tensile-strength fibers, hydrogen storage, rechargeable batteries, catalysis, and in nanotechnology are being contemplated. This Minireview highlights some of the latest developments in the synthesis of inorganic nanotubes and fullerene-like structures. Some structural aspects and properties of IF, which are distinct from the bulk materials, are briefly discussed."

Synthetically, cyclic polymers can be accessed through either macrocyclic ring‐closure or by ring‐expansion polymerization, but the main challenge with either method is the production of highly pure cyclic polymer samples. This highlight describes advances in the area of cyclic polymer synthesis, with a particular focus on ring‐expansion metathesis polymerization.

438,10.1021/JO981319T,1998.0,Mechanochemical Synthesis and Characterization of the Fullerene Dimer C120,"The bulk synthesis of the [2 + 2] dimer of fullerene C60 was achieved by the solid-state mechanochemical reaction of C60 with KCN by the use of a high-speed vibration milling (HSVM) technique. This reaction took place also by the use of potassium salts such as K2CO3 and CH3CO2K, metals such as Li, Na, K, Mg, Al, and Zn, and organic bases such as 4-(dimethylamino)- and 4-aminopyridine. Under optimum conditions, the reaction afforded only the dimer C120 and unchanged C60 in a ratio of about 3:7 (by weight) regardless of the reagent used. The dimer C120 was fully characterized by IR, UV−vis, 13C NMR, and TOF MS spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Comparison of the IR and 13C NMR spectral data of C120 with those reported for all-carbon C60 polymers implied that the [2 + 2] dimer C120 represents the essential subunit of these polymers. The dimer C120 underwent facile dissociation into two C60 molecules by heat, HSVM treatment, exposure to room light, or electrochemical re..."

Compound 8 with a dipyridylmethano addend in a pseudo-octahedral addition pattern was obtained by DMA-templated addition (DMA=9,10-dimethylanthracene; Scheme 1) and served as the starting material for the first supramolecular fullerene dimer 2. Hexakis-adduct 12 also possesses a pseudo-octahedral addition pattern and was obtained by a sequence of tether-directed remote functionalization, tether removal, and regioselective bis-functionalization (Scheme 2). With its two diethynylmethano addends in trans-1 position, it is a precursor for fascinating new oligomers and polymers that feature C60 moieties as part of the polymeric backbone (Fig. 1). With the residual fullerene π-electron chromophore reduced to a `cubic cyclophane'-type sub-structure (Fig. 4), and for steric reasons, 8 and 12 no longer display electrophilic reactivity. As a representative of the second class of hexakis-adducts, (±)-1, which features six addends in a distinct helical array along an equatorial belt, was prepared by a route that involved two sequential tether-directed remote functionalization steps (Schemes 3 and 5). In compound (±)-1, π-electron conjugation between the two unsubstituted poles of the carbon sphere is maintained via two (E)-stilbene-like bridges (Fig. 4). As a result, (±)-1 features very different chemical reactivity and physical properties when compared to hexakis-adducts with a pseudo-octahedral addition pattern. Its reduction under cyclic voltammetric conditions is greatly facilitated (by 570 mV), and it readily undergoes additional, electronically favored Bingel additions at the two sterically well-accessible central polar 6-6 bonds under formation of heptakis- and octakis-adducts, (±)-30 and (±)-31, respectively (Scheme 6). The different extent of the residual π-electron delocalization in the fullerene sphere is also reflected in the optical properties of the two types of hexakis-adducts. Whereas 8 and 12 are bright-yellow (end-absorption around 450 nm), compound (±)-1 is shiny-red, with an end-absorption around 600 nm. This study once more demonstrates the power of templated functionalization strategies in fullerene chemistry, providing addition patterns that are not accessible by stepwise synthetic approaches."

The addition of this macroradicals PS° to 6–6 bonds of C60 follows a specific atom transfer radical addition mechanism that favors the grafting of even number of chains onto the fullerene core. This peculiar mechanism, resulting from the properties of C60, offers an easy synthetic route toward well-defined di- and tetra-adducts. In these adducts the disturbance of the electronic structure of the fullerene is kept at its minimum, as only one double bond needs to be opened on the C60 to add two PS chains and only two double bonds are converted to single bonds in the tetra-adduct. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In all block copolymers, the C60 was connected to the terminal polyisoprene (PI) block. The composition of the copolymers was kept constant (∼30% wt PI), whereas the molecular weight of the diblock chains was varied. The polymers were characterized with a number of techniques, including size exclusion chromatography, membrane osmometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The combined characterization results showed that the synthetic procedures followed led to well-defined materials. However, degradation of the fractionated star-shaped copolymers was observed after storage for 2 months at 4 °C, whereas the nonfractionated material was stable.

Molecular structures of PDTSBTz and PDTSTTz . In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, light weight, and the capability to fabricate fl exible large-area devices. [ 1–5 ] The key issue in studies of PSCs is the power conversion effi ciency (PCE) of the devices. The factors that determine the PCE of the PSCs are the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ), short-circuit current ( J SC ), and fi ll factor (FF). V OC is limited by the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. [ 6 ] The J SC is closely related to the absorption capacity and charge-carrier mobility of the photovoltaic materials, and the FF is infl uenced by the charge-carrier mobility of the photoactive layer. Higher charge-carrier mobility results in larger J SC and higher FF values. [ 7 ] The photoactive layer of PSCs is commonly composed of a blend of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor such as [6,6]-phenyl-C 60 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 60 BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C 70 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70 BM). Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and PC 60 BM are the most representative donor and acceptor materials, and the PCE values of PSCs based on P3HT/PCBM can reach over 4%. [ 8 ] Nevertheless, the relatively large bandgap and higher-lying HOMO energy level ( − 4.76 eV) [ 9 ] of P3HT signifi cantly limits the J SC and V OC values ( V OC is limited to ca. 0.6 V) of PSCs based on P3HT/ PCBM. In order to improve the visible absorption and decrease the HOMO energy level of conjugated polymers, design and synthesis of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers has been proven to be the most successful strategy. [ 10–17 ] With this strategy, the PCE of the PSCs using new D–A copolymers as donor materials has recently reached up to 6–7%. [ 16 , 17 ]"

Fullerenols have unique structural features and possess suitable properties for interaction with the cells. This study aimed to synthesize and characterize a fullerenol derivative with desirable characteristics (size, charge, functionality) to develop cell penetration vehicles. Fullerenol was synthesized from fullerene (C60) solubilized in toluene, followed by hydroxylation with hydrogen peroxide and tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) as a phase transfer catalyst. The obtained product was purified by a Florisil chromatography column (water as the eluent), followed by dialysis (cellulose membrane dialysis tubing) and freeze-drying (yield 66%).

The tetraphenylethylene unit was terminally functionalized with cyanopyridone in order to generate a three-dimensional molecular architecture. The new material TPE-CP4 was produced via a Knoevenagel condensation reaction and was found to be highly soluble in a variety of common organic solvents, such as chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene. TPE-CP4 exhibited promising optoelectronic properties and energy levels complementing those of the conventional donor polymers poly(3-hexylthiophene) [P3HT] and Poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) [PTB7]. Due to its optoelectronic properties, solubility and good film forming capability, TPE-CP4 was incorporated as an n-type semiconducting component along with the commercially available P3HT and PTB7 as the p-type semiconductors in BHJ photovoltaic devices. TPE-CP4 performed very well with both of the donor polymers and afforded 6.02% and 6.72% power conversion efficiencies with P3HT and PTB7, respectively. Not only is TPE-CP4 the first reported example combining tetraphenylethylene and cyanopyridone structural units, but the device performance indicates that it is an efficient non-fullerene acceptor."

463,,1998.0,"Synthesis, thermal degradation, and solution behavior of star-shaped fullerene-containing polystyrenes",Star-shaped polymers with C 60 fullerene as a core and polystyrene chains with preset molecular masses as arms were synthesized by anionic polymerization. It was shown that it is possible to regulate the number of arms by varying the molar ratio of reagents (polystyryllithium: fullerene) and introducing a complex-forming agent. The quantitative data on the mobility and hydrodynamic sizes of macromolecules were obtained. The experimental results are compared with the calculated data on the hydrodynamic radii of macromolecules with spherically-symmetric distribution of the vectors of polystyrene arms. The degree of branching was estimated by comparison of the diffusion coefficients for the real star-shaped macromolecule and its linear analog.

The composition of the reaction products was studied by the methods of thin-layer and gel-permeation chromatography, and by their combination (two-dimensional orthogonal chromatography). The effects of alteration in the order of reagent mixing and variation of the PSL : fullerene molar ratio (from 0.25 to 3) on the composition of products were studied. When a fullerene solution is added to PSL, the product is mostly composed of two components, one comprising a fullerene linked with a single PS chain, and the other, a fullerene linked with several (not less than six) PS chains. For the reverse order of mixing, the product comprises a series of fullerene compounds with various contents of PS chains. It was found that fullerene-containing polymers are unstable when stored without a solvent at room temperature : qualitative changes were observed in the composition of products, which were caused by oxidation and cross-linking."

It was shown that the interaction of the active star-shaped polymers with acid chloride is limited by a substitution of lithium by a carbonyl group and is not accompanied by the acts of coupling of star-shaped macromolecules. The reaction of active, six-armed, star-shaped polymers with dimethyldichlorosilane leads to the products of pair coupling of star-shaped macromolecules through a silicon atom. A method which allows variation in the number of arms in a star-shaped macromolecule was developed on the basis of reactions of functionalization and coupling of star-shaped macromolecules.

The copolymer is soluble in polar solvents such as water, methanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran. TEM observation revealed its ideal spherical shape in water with an average diameter of about 40 nm. Four-ball machine tests indicated that addition of an amount of 0.5%(mass fraction) the fullerene copolymer to base stock can effectively increase the bearing capacity(P B value) and the antiwearing ability of the base stock(2%(mass fraction) of triethanolamine and 0.5%(mass fraction) of OPZ aqueous solution). The morphology study of the worn surfaces by SEM showed that addition of the copolymer leads to reduction of wear scar size and decrease of wear depth. With the increasing of the content of the fullerene copolymer, the friction coefficient reduces rapidly from 0.233 for base stock to minimum value of 0.061 5.

471,10.1002/9783527823987.VOL3_C1,2019.0,"Control of Electronic Property of C60
 Fullerene via Polymerization","Fullerenes, the spherical cage molecules composed of carbon atoms, were discovered by Kuroto and Smalley coworkers in 1985 [1]. After the development of a large-scale synthesis method by Kraetschmer et al. in 1990 [2], they became usable not only in vacuum but also in atmospheric conditions. C60 is the most popular molecule in the fullerenes composed of 60 carbon atoms as shown in Figure 1.1a. It has semiconductor characteristics having a bandgap. The experimental values have been shown as typically 1.5–1.8 eV for the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gap [3, 4]; however, the value varies within the range of 1.43–2.35. The electrical properties of fullerene are based on the bandgap. It shows n-type semiconductor characteristics; the activation energy is less than half of the bandgap and is close to the half value only at high temperatures. At around room temperature, the activation energy is in the range of 100–200 meV, which relates to activation from the donner-like state within the optical gap [5]. The transport properties are strongly affected also by the orientation state of the crystalline fullerene. On decreasing the temperature from room temperature, the first kink of the conductivity is observed at around 260 K related to the restriction of the orientation angle of rotation of C60 molecules [6]. The second kink at 90 K relates to the glass transition of the orientation angle. The conductivity drastically falls by several orders of magnitude, mostly becoming insulating due to absorption of oxygen molecules [7]. This is due to the formation of deep level trap sites lying 0.7 eV below the bottom of the conduction band. Therefore, most of the transport measurements of the semiconducting properties are done in vacuum conditions. An inert atmosphere such as argon, nitrogen, or helium also helps maintain the conductivity. If the sample was exposed in air once, heating at 160–180 ∘C in vacuum is necessary to recover the conductivity by desorbing oxygen from the thin film of fullerene [8]."

Herein, a new donor polymer, named PBTT‐F, based on a strongly electron‐deficient core (5,7‐dibromo‐2,3‐bis(2‐ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐c′]dithiophene‐4,8‐dione, TTDO), is developed through the design of cyclohexane‐1,4‐dione embedded into a thieno[3,4‐b]thiophene (TT) unit. When blended with the acceptor Y6, the PBTT‐F‐based photovoltaic device exhibits an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.1% with a very high fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. This polymer also shows high efficiency for a thick‐film device, with a PCE of ≈14.2% being realized for an active layer thickness of 190 nm. In addition, the PBTT‐F‐based polymer solar cells also show good stability after storage for ≈700 h in a glove box, with a high PCE of ≈14.8%, which obviously shows that this kind of polymer is very promising for future commercial applications.

Novel effective polymer solar cells had been fabricated by introducing 1, 7-disubstituted perylene diimide derivatives PDIH, PDIC, and PDIN as an electron transporting layer. It was noteworthy that PDIN could obviously improve the power conversion efficiency of solar cells that incorporated a photoactive layer composed of poly[(3-hexylthiophene)-2, 5-diyl] (P3HT) and the fullerene acceptor [6, 6-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester] (PC71BM). The power conversion efficiency varies from 1.5% for ZnO transparent cathode-based solar cells to 2.1% for PDIN-based electron transport layer-free solar cells. This improved performance could be attributed to the following reasons: the interaction between N atom in PDIN and O atom in indium tin oxide (ITO) reduced the work function of ITO, increased the built-in electric field, and thus lowered the electron transport barrier and improved the electron extraction ability of cathode, the appropriate roughness of the active layer increased the contact area with anode interfacial layer and enhanced the hole transport efficiency. These experimental results revealed that PDIN can be a promising novel effective material with a simplified synthesis process and lower cost as an electron transporting layer."

This report describes how PBTff4T-2OD and PffBT4T-2OD are generated in a direct arylation polycondensation (DAP) approach with molecular weights up to Mn =19.4 kDa and 21.1 kDa, respectively, and how structural defects in the copolymers (e. g., homocoupling defects) show a strong impact on the pre-aggregation behavior. The optimized reaction conditions allow for a distinct reduction of the amount of such defects in the resulting copolymers. When the Stille-type products are used in the active layer of organic solar cells (OCSs) together with fullerene acceptors, high power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range of 8.6-10.8 % have been reported. The high PCEs are particularly related to the pre-aggregation of the conjugated copolymers prior to film formation. Despite quite similar characterization data, non-optimized OCSs with the DAP polymers as replacement for the Stille products afforded a relatively low power-conversion efficiency of up to 2.4 %."
477,10.1117/12.2321996,2018.0,Crystallization of non-fullerene acceptor might cause catastrophic failure in ductile organic solar cells (Conference Presentation),"Organic solar cell (OSC) technology has recently achieved over 13% efficiency through the synthesis of novel non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFAs), which can be processed from benign solvents as low-cost third generation photovoltaics[1,2]. Of critical importance to OSCs is understanding the morphological and thermal stability of the active layers governed by thermodynamics and kinetics as an intrinsic stability process which cannot be controlled by encapsulation[3,4]. Here we highlight the importance of ductility of donor polymers on nucleation and growth of micro-size small molecule crystals which leads to the catastrophic failure of the solar cells in the long-term operating condition We consider three high performance polymers P3HT, PBnDBT-FTAZ, and PffBT4T-C9C13 blended with EH-IDTBR as the model systems to investigate the thermal stability of state of the art non-fullerene OSCs, where elevated temperatures were used to accelerate the crystal formation and imitate the long-term operation conditions of OCSs. We also propose an easy accessible method using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate the thermal behavior of NFA in the blends. Although non-fullerene solar cells have shown to have better overall morphological stability compared to their fullerene counterparts, our results suggest that catastrophic failure due to micro-size crystal formation in non-fullerene systems can happen at a rate similar to fullerene systems unless the right donor polymer is chosen to suppress the crystallization of small molecule. It is also shown and argued that the growth rate of small molecule crystals can be reduced upon mixing of NFAs with semi-crystalline polymers, such as P3HT with a higher overall density compared to amorphous donor polymers, i.e. PBnDT-FTAZ. Our findings may pave a way to understand and predict the morphological stability of non-fullerene OSCs.

Given the large pool of potential D and A units and the laborious processes of chemical synthesis and device optimization, progress on new high efficiency materials can, and has been, slow with a few new efficient copolymers reported every year despite the large number of groups pursuing these materials. In this paper we present an integrated approach toward new narrow bandgap copolymers that uses theory to guide the selection of materials to be synthesized based on their predicted energy levels, and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) to select the best-performing copolymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction to be incorporated into complete OPV devices. We validate our methodology by using a diverse group of 12 copolymers, including new and literature materials, to demonstrate good correlation between (a) theoretically determined energy levels of polymers and experimentally determined ionization energies and electron affinities and (b) photoconductance, measured by TRMC, and OPV device performance. The materials used here also allow us to explore whether further copolymer design rules need to be incorporated into our methodology for materials selection. For example, we explore the effect of the enthalpy change (ΔH) during exciton dissociation on the efficiency of free charge carrier generation and device efficiency and find that ΔH of −0.4 eV is sufficient for efficient charge generation."

Understanding of low-dimension carbon material family (CNT, fullerenes, graphene, and graphene quantum dots) has arrived at a certain extension. In this report, graphene quantum dots were synthesized from graphene oxide with a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. Compared with conventional time-consuming hydrothermal routes, this novel method requires a much shorter time, around ten minutes. Successful formation of quantum dots derived from graphene sheets was verified with microscopic and spectroscopic characterization. Nanoparticles present a diameter of about 2-8 nm, blue emission under ultraviolet excitation, and good dispersion in polar solvents and can be collected in powder form. The synthesized graphene quantum dots were utilized as a hole transport layer in organic solar cells to enhance the cell quantum efficiency. Such quantum dots possess energy levels (Ec and Ev) relevant to HOMO and LUMO levels of conductive polymers. Mixing P3HT:PCBM polymer and graphene quantum dots of sufficient extent notably helps reduce potential difference at interfaces of the two materials.

484,10.1002/adma.201300580,2013.0,Doping of Fullerenes via Anion‐Induced Electron Transfer and Its Implication for Surfactant Facilitated High Performance Polymer Solar Cells,Simple and solution-processible tetrabutyl-ammonium salts (TBAX) can dope fullerene and its derivatives to achieve conductive thin films (σ as high as 0.56 S/m). The electron transfer between the anions of TBAXs and n-type semiconductors induces doping without encountering any harsh activation. These provide valid support for the surfactant interfacial doping of fullerene in polymer solar cells for enhanced device performance.

Here we demonstrate that condensation polymerization of 2,5-bis(5-trimethylstannyl-2-thienyl)-N-dodecylpyrrole and 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole in the presence of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 as a catalyst affords a novel conjugated oligomeric material (PTPTB), which exhibits a low optical bandgap as a result of the alternation of electron-rich and electron-deficient units along the chain. By varying the molar ratio of the monomers in the reaction and fractionation of the reaction product, two different molecular weight fractions (PTPTB-I and PTPTB-II, see Experimental section) were isolated, containing 5–17 and 13–33 aromatic units respectively, as inferred from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Thin films of PTPTB-I and PTPTB-II exhibit an optical bandgap of 1.60 and 1.46 eV, respectively. Photoinduced absorption (PIA) and photoluminescence spectroscopy of blends of PTPTB-I and a methanofullerene (1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]C61, PCBM) gave direct spectral evidence of the photoinduced electron-transfer reaction from PTPTB-I as a donor to the fullerene derivative as an acceptor. Thin PTPTB-I:PCBM composite films were sandwiched between indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (ITO/PEDOT:PSS) and Al electrodes to prepare working photovoltaic devices, which show an open circuit voltage of 0.67 V under white-light illumination. The spectral dependence of the device shows an onset of the photocurrent at 1.65 eV (750 nm)."
487,10.1002/adma.200600160,2006.0,High Photovoltaic Performance of a Low‐Bandgap Polymer,"The effective conversion of solar energy into electricity is becoming a very important issue in times of rising energy costs. Conjugated polymers and their use in polymer photo-voltaics offer a great technological potential as renewable energy sources for electrical energy and they are currently one of the most promising approaches for the next generation thin-film photovoltaic devices. [1–3] The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept, [4] utilizing a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative for ultrafast charge transfer [5,6] at the donor/acceptor interface with a photoinduced charge generation close to one is regarded as the ideal system for photovoltaic applications. The formation of an interpenetrating network of the two components benefits from a large interfacial area in parallel with a homogeneous, efficient charge generation throughout the sample. Despite the attractiveness of low-cost processing, a major barrier towards a product is the efficiency of polymer solar cells, which is still significantly lower than for inorganic devices. Recently, several groups independently re-ported new record efficiencies for polymer-based solar cells, overcoming the magic efficiency barrier of 5%, [7–10] and focusing their work mostly on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT). However, with a bandgap of 1.9 eV this system is still limited by the mismatch of the absorption to the terrestrial solar spectrum. Its optical bandgap is not optimized with respect to the maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum at around 1.6–1.8 eV. We have recently calculated the optimum bandgap for BHJ solar cells utilizing fullerenes as acceptors. [11] Because of intrinsic losses, i.e., energetic losses to overcome the exciton binding energy, the optimum bandgap"
488,10.1021/MA00122A003,1995.0,Synthesis and SANS Structural Characterization of Polymer-Substituted Fullerenes (Flagellenes),"Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) has been shown to be an appropriate technique for the structural characterization of fullerenes in solvents with strong SANS contrast (e.g., CS 2 ) [Affholter, K. A. ; Henderson, S. J. ; Wignall, G. D. ; Bunick, G. J. ; Haufler, R. E. ; Compton, R. N. J. Chem. Phys. 1993, 99, 9224]. Since deuterated solvents (e.g., toluene-d 8 ) have a high scattering length density (SLD) which is close to that of C 60 and C 70 fullerenes, there is virtually no SANS contrast with the solvent, and these particles are practically invisible in such media. On the other hand, the negative scattering length of hydrogen means that the SLD of 1 H-containing materials is much lower, so they have a strong contrast with toluene-d 8 . Thus, SANS makes it possible to study the sizes and shapes of polymer-substituted fullerenes (flagellenes) [Samulski, E. T. ; DeSimone, J. M. ; Hung, M. O., Jr. ; Menceloglu, Y. Z. ; Jarnagin, R. C. ; York, G. A. ; Labat, K. B. ; Wang, H. Chem. Mater. 1992, 4, 1153]. Mono- and dipolystyrene-substituted C 60 were synthesized via termination of living anionic polymerization of styrene in an optimization of our previous work [Samulski et al.]. These materials were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The extrapolated cross section at zero angle of scatter [dΣ/dΩ(0)] is a function of the number of pendant chains, so SANS can be used to assess the number of arms which are covalently attached to the fullerene core. Close agreement (±4%) between the measured and calculated values of dΣ/dΩ(0) and with independent estimates of the radius of gyration (R g ) and second virial coefficient (A 2 ) for a linear polystyrene calibration sample serves as a cross check on the validity of this methodology."
489,10.1039/d0ra03579c,2020.0,Functionalization of pristine graphene for the synthesis of covalent graphene–polyaniline nanocomposite,"Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most studied conducting polymers owing to its high electrical conductivity, straightforward synthesis and stability. Graphene-supported PANI nanocomposite materials combine the superior physical properties of graphene, synergistically enhancing the performance of PANI as well as giving rise to new properties. Covalent nanocomposites have shown to give higher stability and better performance than their non-covalent counterparts, however, the covalent graphene–PANI nanocomposite are primarily prepared from graphene oxide. We report a new method to synthesize covalent graphene–PANI nanocomposites from pristine graphene. Using few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes as the model system, we first conjugated aniline to FLG via a perfluorophenyl azide (PFPA)-mediated coupling chemistry. A subsequent in situ polymerization of aniline gave polyaniline covalently grafted on the FLG surface. Characterization by FTIR, TEM, SEM, XPS, XRD and electrochemistry confirmed the successful conjugation of PANI to FLG. The grafting density of PANI was estimated by thermal analysis to be ∼26%. As the PFPA-mediated coupling chemistry is applicable to other carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and fullerene, the method developed in this work can be readily adapted to grow PANI on these materials."
490,10.1021/acsami.3c04282,2023.0,Vacuum-Deposited Donors for Low-Voltage-Loss Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells,"The advent of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) enabled records of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) exceeding 19% power conversion efficiency in the laboratory. However, high-efficiency NFAs have so far only been realized in solution-processed blends. Due to its proven track record in upscaled industrial production, vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE) is of prime interest for real-world OPV commercialization. Here, we combine the benchmark solution-processed NFA Y6 with three different evaporated donors in a bilayer (planar heterojunction) architecture. We find that voltage losses decrease by hundreds of millivolts when VTE donors are paired with the NFA instead of the fullerene C60, the current standard acceptor in VTE OPVs. By showing that evaporated small-molecule donors behave much like solution-processed donor polymers in terms of voltage loss when combined with NFAs, we highlight the immense potential for evaporable NFAs and the urgent need to direct synthesis efforts toward making smaller, evaporable compounds."
491,10.1021/acs.macromol.3c00843,2023.0,p-Type Conjugated Polymers Containing Electron-Deficient Pentacyclic Azepinedione,"Bisthienoazepinedione (BTA) has been reported for constructing high-performing p-type conjugated polymers in organic electronics, but the ring extended version of BTA is not well explored. In this work, we report a new synthesis of a key building block to the ring expanded electron-deficient pentacyclic azepinedione (BTTA). Three copolymers of BTAA with benzodithiophene substituted by different side chains are prepared. These polymers exhibit similar energy levels and optical absorption in solution and solid state, while significant differences are revealed in their film morphologies and behavior in transistor and photovoltaic devices. The best-performing polymers in transistor devices contained alkylthienyl side chains on the BDT unit (pBDT-BTTA-2 and pBDT-BTTA-3) and demonstrated maximum saturation hole mobilities of 0.027 and 0.017 cm2 V–1 s–1. Blends of these polymers with PC71BM exhibited a best photovoltaic efficiency of 6.78% for pBDT-BTTA-3-based devices. Changing to a low band gap non-fullerene acceptor (BTP-eC9) resulted in improved efficiency of up to 13.5%. Our results are among the best device performances for BTA and BTTA-based p-type polymers and highlight the versatile applications of this electron-deficient BTTA unit."
492,10.1039/C0EE00668H,2011.0,Organic non-fullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics,"Heterojunction organic photovoltaics have been the subject of intensive academic interest over the past two decades, and significant commercial efforts have been directed towards this area with the vision of developing the next generation of low-cost solar cells. Materials development has played a vital role in the dramatic improvement of organic solar cell performance in recent years, and this is driven primarily by the advancement of p-type semiconductors as donor materials. With the highest performing solar cells today dominated by acceptors based on members of the fullerene family, much less attention has been devoted to other classes of n-type acceptors. In this review, we will provide an overview of the progress in the synthesis, characterization and implementation of the various classes of non-fullerene-based n-type organic acceptors for photovoltaic applications."

There are many species that can fall under this category, one of the most important of which contain biopolymeric materials as a matrix and are additionally reinforced by different types of carbon sources. Such materials are characterized by many diverse properties in a variety industrial and applied fields but especially in the field of biomedical applications. The biopolymeric materials that fall under this label are divided into natural biopolymers, which include chitosan, cellulose, and gelatin, and industrial or synthetic polymers, which include polycaprolactone, polyurethane, and conducting polymers of variable chemical structures. Furthermore, there are many types of carbon nanomaterials that are used as enhancers in the chemical synthesis of these materials as reinforcement agents, which include carbon nanotubes, graphene, and fullerene. This research investigates natural biopolymers, which can be composed of carbon materials, and the educational and medical applications that have been developed for them in recent years.

494,10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02578,2023.0,Boosting Photocatalytic Water Splitting of Polymeric C60 by Reduced Dimensionality from Two-Dimensional Monolayer to One-Dimensional Chain,"The recent synthesis of monolayer fullerene networks (HouL., et al. Nature2022, 606, 50735705817 ) provides new opportunities for photovoltaics and photocatalysis because of their versatile crystal structures for further tailoring of electronic, optical, and chemical function. To shed light on the structural aspects of the photocatalytic water splitting performance of fullerene nanomaterials, we compare the photocatalytic properties of individual polymeric fullerene chains and monolayer fullerene networks from first-principles calculations. We find that the photocatalytic efficiency can be further optimized by reducing the dimensionality from two-dimensional (2D) to one-dimensional (1D). The conduction band edge of the polymeric C60 chain provides an external potential for the hydrogen reduction reaction much higher than that of its monolayer counterparts over a wider range of pH values, and there are 2 times more surface active sites in the 1D chain than in the 2D networks from a thermodynamic perspective. These observations identify the 1D fullerene polymer as a more promising candidate as a photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction in comparison to monolayer fullerene networks."
495,10.1002/chem.201404328,2014.0,Supramolecular fullerene polymers and networks directed by molecular recognition between calix[5]arene and C60.,"A biscalix[5]arene-C60 supramolecular structure was utilized for the development of supramolecular fullerene polymers. Di- and tritopic hosts were developed to generate the linear and network supramolecular polymers through the complexation of a dumbbell-shaped fullerene. The molecular association between the hosts and the fullerene were carefully studied by using (1) H NMR, UV/Vis absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The formation of the supramolecular fullerene polymers and networks was confirmed by diffusion-ordered (1) H NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and solution viscometry. Upon concentrating the mixtures of di- or tritopic hosts and dumbbell-shaped fullerene in the range of 1.0-10 mmol L(-1) , the diffusion coefficients of the complexes decreased, and the solution viscosities increased, suggesting that large polymeric assemblies were formed in solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to image the supramolecular fullerene polymers and networks. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provided insight into the morphology of the supramolecular polymers. A mixture of the homoditopic host and the fullerene resulted in fibers with a height of (1.4±0.1) nm and a width of (5.0±0.8) nm. Interdigitation of the alkyl side chains provided secondary interchain interactions that facilitated supramolecular organization. The homotritopic host generated the supramolecular networks with the dumbbell-shaped fullerene. Honeycomb sheet-like structures with many voids were found. The growth of the supramolecular polymers is evidently governed by the shape, dimension, and directionality of the monomers."
496,10.1002/APP.27600,2008.0,"Synthesis, characterization, and photophysics of a novel conjugated polymer with 1,3,4-oxadiazole, carbazole, and naphthalene units","A polymer containing 1,3,4-oxadiazole and carbazole units in the main chain and naphthalene moieties as side groups (P-OCN) was synthesized by the Wittig reaction of [2,5-bis(3-tolylene)1′,3′,4-oxadiazole]-9-(α-naphthyl)-carbazole polymer (P-OCN). The optical properties were investigated with ultraviolet–visible absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. The results showed that the luminescence quantum yield of P-OCN was 0.673 in chloroform, and it emitted blue and blue-green light with a band gap of 3.49 eV estimated from the onset absorption. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry showed that the polymer exhibited good thermal stability up to 354°C with a glass-transition temperature higher than 110°C. To investigate the donating and accepting capacities of P-OCN, the fluorescent quenching technique was used to determinate the interactions between the polymer and the electron donor and electron acceptor. The results showed that the light emission could be quenched by both the electron donor (N,N-dimethylaniline) and electron acceptor (dimethylterephthalate). Furthermore, the interaction between P-OCN and fullerene was also studied with fluorescent quenching, and the processes followed the Stern–Volmer equation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

497,10.3762/BJOC.12.182,2016.0,Synthesis and characterization of fluorinated azadipyrromethene complexes as acceptors for organic photovoltaics,"Homoleptic zinc(II) complexes of di(phenylacetylene)azadipyrromethene (e.g., Zn(WS3)2) are potential non-fullerene electron acceptors for organic photovoltaics. To tune their properties, fluorination of Zn(WS3)2 at various positions was investigated. Three fluorinated azadipyrromethene-based ligands were synthesized with fluorine at the para-position of the proximal and distal phenyl groups, and at the pyrrolic phenylacetylene moieties. Additionally, a CF3 moiety was added to the pyrrolic phenyl positions to study the effects of a stronger electron withdrawing unit at that position. The four ligands were chelated with zinc(II) and BF2+ and the optical and electrochemical properties were studied. Fluorination had little effect on the optical properties of both the zinc(II) and BF2+ complexes, with λmax in solution around 755 nm and 785 nm, and high molar absorptivities of 100 × 103 M−1cm−1 and 50 × 103 M−1cm−1, respectively. Fluorination of Zn(WS3)2 raised the oxidation potentials by 0.04 V to 0.10 V, and the reduction potentials by 0.01 V to 0.10 V, depending on the position and type of substitution. The largest change was observed for fluorine substitution at the proximal phenyl groups and CF3 substitution at the pyrrolic phenylacetylene moieties. The later complexes are expected to be stronger electron acceptors than Zn(WS3)2, and may enable charge transfer from other conjugated polymer donors that have lower energy levels than poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)."
498,10.1039/B913168J,2010.0,Advanced materials and processes for polymer solar cell devices,"The rapidly expanding field of polymer and organic solar cells is reviewed in the context of materials, processes and devices that significantly deviate from the standard approach which involves rigid glass substrates, indium-tin-oxide electrodes, spincoated layers of conjugated polymer/fullerene mixtures and evaporated metal electrodes in a flat multilayer geometry. It is likely that significant advances can be found by pursuing many of these novel ideas further and the purpose of this review is to highlight these reports and hopefully spark new interest in materials and methods that may be performing less than the current state-of-the-art in their present form but that may have the potential to outperform these pending a larger investment in effort."
499,10.1021/nl204421p,2012.0,Molecular packing and solar cell performance in blends of polymers with a bisadduct fullerene.,"We compare the solar cell performance of several polymers with the conventional electron acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to fullerenes with one to three indene adducts. We find that the multiadduct fullerenes with lower electron affinity improve the efficiency of the solar cells only when they do not intercalate between the polymer side chains. When they intercalate between the side chains, the multiadduct fullerenes substantially reduce solar cell photocurrent. We use X-ray diffraction to determine how the fullerenes are arranged within crystals of poly-(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT) and suggest that poor electron transport in the molecularly mixed domains may account for the reduced solar cell performance of blends with fullerene intercalation."
