In this paper, we investigated the putative implication of 12 vaccines, including BCG, OPV and MMR in the protection against COVID-19. Sequences of the main antigenic proteins in the investigated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 proteins were compared to identify similar patterns. The immunogenic effect of identified segments was, then, assessed using a combination of structural and antigenicity prediction tools. Results A total of 14 highly similar segments were identified in the investigated vaccines. Structural and antigenicity prediction analysis showed that, among the identified patterns, three segments in Hepatitis B, Tetanus, and Measles proteins presented antigenic properties that can induce putative protective effect against COVID-19. Conclusions Our results suggest a possible protective effect of HBV, Tetanus and Measles vaccines against COVID-19, which may explain the variation of the disease severity among regions."

So far, descriptions of morphology have been semi-quantitative and loosely linked to device performance. However, by using our recently reported quantitative analysis tool m2py, we create morphology labels and, for the first time, extract quantitative morphology information from scanning probe microscopy measurements. In this work, we use the labels and extracted morphology measurements to validate a novel approach of generating quantitative structure–property relationships through the use of machine learning and regression models; we present this generalizable approach by demonstrating it on organic photovoltaics. In our approach, the open-source toolkit, m2py, is used to label and describe a set of organic photovoltaic devices that have received different thermal annealing treatments, thereby altering their morphologies and, subsequently, their performance. Different regressors and types of morphology descriptions are used to examine the efficacy of quantitative morphology descriptors in predicting device performance. Despite the fact that scanning probe measurements only image the thin film surface, we find that the information-rich nature of morphology data enables accurate device performance predictions, even with datasets that would traditionally be considered too small to generate high-quality predictions. The implications of introducing quantitative morphology information for predictive analysis of other devices and materials is also discussed; given the general and material-agnostic nature of m2py, it is anticipated that the predictive capability of these labels will be ubiquitous to all thin film applications."
2,2,10.1016/j.jlumin.2021.118192,,,Cyano-substituted oligo (p-phenylene vinylene)-Based supramolecular nanostructure capable of detecting a specific enzyme,2021,"Abstract We report on the cyano-OPV (1) possessing a trimethyl-locked quinone group exhibited monomer and aggregate emissions with distinct colors determined by the ratio of tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O), thereby suggesting a strong dependence on the polarity of the solvent. In contrast, cyano-OPV (2) possessing an amine group exhibited a yellow emission in the THF/H2O mixture, regardless of the ratio of solvents used, which is indicative of the formation of a supramolecular aggregate by π-π stacking and intermolecular hydrogen-bonds. This further supports the AFM and DLS observations in which 1 and 2 are shown to be comprised of spherical nanoparticles with mean diameters of ~300 nm. The supramolecular aggregate 2 is generated by a cooperative pathway involving a nucleation-elongation mechanism. More interestingly, 1 was converted to 2 in the presence of NQO1 and NADPH, in a mixture of THF/H2O (20:80 v/v) at 37 °C, which lead to the formation of the supramolecular aggregate with its characteristic yellow emission."
3,3,10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.166937,,,Effects of the photoactive layer properties and current transmission mechanism on optical and electrical characteristics of organic photovoltaic,2021,"Abstract The P3HT:PCBM is an important organic material as an active layer for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, in terms of photophysical properties, blend ratios of both materials and device design is an important parameter for OPVs devices. In this study, the P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer, blended in different proportions by mass (1:1, 1:0.8, 1:0.6) was coated on the PEDOT:PSS surface using the spin coater method for different devices. Finally, Al have been evaporated on the photoactive layer and the device structure completed. In other examples, 2 nm lithium fluoride (LiF) as buffer layer evaporated on the active layer for each blending ratio before metal. Optical absorption, AFM, XRD, Raman and XPS measurements were taken for each active layer and it was observed that the surface morphology and absorption characteristic of the active layer changed according to the mixing ratios. This change in active layer properties directly affected the device parameters. Electrical characterization of the six different devices performed with current density-voltage (J–V) measurement and by used a solar simulator under 100 mW/cm2 irradiation intensity. Depending on the increase in short circuit current density (Jsc) and open current voltage (Voc) values in the devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPVs obtained varied between 0.86% and 2.74%. This change can be attributed to the fact that the P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer forms a smoother surface morphology depending on the PCBM ratio and the series resistance decreases. Another reason for this change in PCE can be explained by the effective electron injection of the LiF layer, LiF/Al layer with lower work function and less carrier deposition at its metal-active layer interfaces. It result has been obtained that the active layer with a ratio of 1:0.8 has a more homogeneous surface morphology and the series resistance decreases, the presence of the LiF layer in the device structures increases the Jsc and Voc, accordingly the PCE increases to 2.74%. These results showed that BHJ OPV with high PCE can be obtained with the ideal mixing ratio and appropriate device design."

5,5,10.1007/s11664-021-09020-5,,,Optimization of Nanoparticle Organic Photovoltaic Device Performance using SCAPS Software,2021,"The fabrication of nanoparticle (NP) organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells has attracted great interest due to the possibility of controlling the morphology of the active layer and eliminating harmful solvents. However, NP OPV devices exhibit low efficiency compared with bulk heterojunction devices. The solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) simulation package using a framework based on a one-dimensional drift–diffusion model is applied in the current work to improve the efficiency of NP OPV devices with a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) active layer. The optimization results confirm that the best thickness for the active layer is 100 nm to 120 nm and that the device reaches its highest performance in this thickness range but low efficiency for thicknesses above 120 nm. Changing the electron mobility (in the range of 1 × 10−3 cm2/V-s < µe < 1 × 10−4 cm2/V-s) is found to have no impact on the device efficiency, whereas the device performance is improved by 27% when the hole mobility is varied in this range (1 × 10−3 cm2/V-s < µh < 1 × 10−4 cm2/V-s). Additionally, the donor and acceptor density (ND and NA) are optimized, revealing that the best values of 1 × 1015 cm−3 and 1 × 1018 cm3, respectively, lead to an improvement in the device efficiency by about 60%. The current findings indicate that the performance of NP OPV devices can indeed be enhanced by optimizing the morphology of the active layer."
7,7,10.1002/anie.202102622,,,Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Bulk Morphology in Efficient Donor–Acceptor Photovoltaic Blends,2021,"Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a critical role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thereby determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology-performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. In this work, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular orientation at the D-A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. In addition, enhancing the D-A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Our work proposes a molecular design strategy that can finely-tune the bulk morphology to achieve balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells."
8,8,10.1021/acsami.1c08487,,,Tricyclic or Pentacyclic D Units: Design of D-I -A-Type Copolymers for High V<inf>OC</inf>Organic Photovoltaic Cells,2021,"Although there are several electron-donating (D) units, only the classic benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophenes (BDT) unit was utilized to develop D-π-A-type copolymers for high-voltage organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Hence, in this work, we chose two tricyclic D units, BDT and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difurans (BDF), together with one pentacyclic ring, dithieno[2,3-d;2',3'-d']benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']dithiophenes (DTBDT), to comprehensively study the effect of different D units on the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. By copolymerized with the benzo[1,2,3]triazole (BTA) electron-accepting unit, the final copolymers J52-Cl, F11, and PE52 were combined with a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) F-BTA3 according to the ""Same-A-Strategy."" As we preconceived, all the three single-junction OPV cells can obtain high open-circuit voltage (VOC) over 1.10 V. Although the tricyclic D unit of BDF exhibits a slightly lower VOC of 1.12 V because of its mildly larger energy loss of 0.698 eV, its higher carrier mobilities and exciton dissociation efficiency strikingly boost the short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor, which contribute to a comparable PCE of 10.04% with J52-Cl (10.10%). However, the DTBDT-based polymer PE52 shows the worst performance with a PCE of 6.78% and a VOC of 1.14 V, owing to the higher bimolecular recombination and disordered molecular stacking. Our results indicate that tricyclic D units should be a better choice for constructing D-π-A-type polymers for high-voltage photovoltaic materials than the pentacyclic analogues."
9,9,10.3390/vaccines9070688,,,Development of a quantitative one-step rt-pcr method for the detection of sabin 2 virus contamination in a novel oral poliovirus vaccine type 2,2021,"To control circulating vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus outbreaks, a more genetically stable novel Oral Poliovirus Vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) was developed by targeted modifications of Sabin 2 genome. Since the use of OPV2 made of Sabin 2 strain has been stopped, it is important to exclude the possibility that batches of nOPV2 are contaminated with Sabin 2 virus. Here, we report the development of a simple quantitative one-step reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection and quantitation of Sabin 2 virus in the presence of overwhelming amounts of nOPV2 strain. The method is specific and linear within 8 log10 range even in the presence of relevant amounts of nOPV2 virus. It is sensitive, with a lower limit of detection of 0.2 CCID50/mL (an equivalent of 198 genome copies per mL), and generates reproducible results. This assay can be used for quality control and lot release of the nOPV2."
10,10,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2021.3074077,,,Investigating the Indoor Performance of Planar Heterojunction Based Organic Photovoltaics,2021,"Recently, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-based photoactive layer has been favored over the planar heterojunction (PHJ)-based photoactive layer for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), owing to the evitable thickness limit of the latter induced by the low mobility of charge carriers. However, under dim indoor light conditions, the PV performance becomes immune to the resistive components of the PHJ OPVs, such as a thick photoactive layer, thereby rendering them attractive for operating indoors. In this study, we devise and demonstrate indoor OPVs with a PHJ-based photoactive layer constituting poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA). The performance of the PHJ OPVs was optimized by modulating the thickness of the ICBA layer under a 1000 lx light-emitting diode lamp. OPVs with a 65 nm-thick ICBA layer exhibited excellent indoor performance with a power conversion efficiency of 15.3 ± 0.3%, comparable to that of the reference BHJ OPVs (15.0 ± 0.2%). No noticeable performance degradation was observed by increasing the thickness of the PHJ-based photoactive layer; instead, a thick photoactive layer only enhanced the light absorption, resulting in excellent indoor performance with a higher photocurrent."
12,12,10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2021.110496,,,Uniform fiber-like polymeric micelles of controlled length containing a photo-cleavable core: Versatile templates toward functional nanotubes,2021,"Abstract Inorganic nanotubes with unique and well-defined porous structures show promising applications in diverse functional materials. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate inorganic nanotubes with precise length controllability. Herein, we report the synthesis of block copolymers consisting of a crystalline π-conjugated oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) block, a hydrophilic poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) segment and a photo-cleavable o-nitrobenzyl (ONB) junction. By taking advantage of crystallinity of OPV segment, self-seeding approach of living crystallization-driven self-assembly was employed to generate uniform fiber-like micelles composed of an OPV core and a P2VP corona. The P2VP corona was then used to host the formation of silica, titania and Pt(0)-embedded silica shell. After the photo-cleavable OBN junctions were broken under light irradiation, the OPV core can be removed in a good solvent for OPV segments to give silica, titania and Pt(0)-embedded silica nanotubes. Significantly, the Pt(0)-embedded silica nanotubes exhibited much higher catalytic activity toward the reduction of p-nitroaniline than Pt(0)-embedded silica nanofibers with the same Pt content, probably owing to the presence of porous channel for nanotubes. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate inorganic nanotubes of controlled length."
14,14,10.1063/5.0050574,,,CTRAMER: An open-source software package for correlating interfacial charge transfer rate constants with donor/acceptor geometries in organic photovoltaic materials,2021,"In this paper, we present CTRAMER (Charge-Transfer RAtes from Molecular dynamics, Electronic structure, and Rate theory)-an open-source software package for calculating interfacial charge-transfer (CT) rate constants in organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials based on ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The software is based on identifying representative donor/acceptor geometries within interfacial structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of donor/acceptor blends and calculating the corresponding Fermi's golden rule CT rate constants within the framework of the linearized-semiclassical approximation. While the methods used are well established, the integration of these state-of-the-art tools originating from different disciplines to study photoinduced CT processes with explicit treatment of the environment, in our opinion, makes this package unique and innovative. The software also provides tools for investigating other observables of interest. After outlining the features and implementation details, the usage and performance of the software are demonstrated with results from an example OPV system."
15,15,10.3390/en14123412,,,State-of-the-art review on the energy performance of semi-transparent building integrated photovoltaic across a range of different climatic and environmental conditions,2021,"Semi-transparent Building Integrated Photovoltaics provide a fresh approach to the renewable energy sector, combining the potential of energy generation with aesthetically pleasing, multi-functional building components. Employing a range of technologies, they can be integrated into the envelope of the building in different ways, for instance, as a key element of the roofing or facade in urban areas. Energy performance, measured by their ability to produce electrical power, at the same time as delivering thermal and optical efficiencies, is not only impacted by the system properties, but also by a variety of climatic and environmental factors. The analytical framework laid out in this paper can be employed to critically analyse the most efficient solution for a specific location; however, it is not always possible to mitigate energy losses, using commercially available materials. For this reason, a brief overview of new concept devices is provided, outlining the way in which they mitigate energy losses and providing innovative solutions for a sustainable energy future."
16,16,10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100886,,,National immunisation campaigns with oral polio vaccine may reduce all-cause mortality: Analysis of 2004–2019 demographic surveillance data in rural Bangladesh,2021,"Background West African studies have suggested that national immunisation campaigns with oral polio vaccine (C-OPV) may non-specifically reduce all-cause child mortality rate by 15–25%. We investigated whether C-OPVs had similar non-specific effects in rural Bangladesh from 2004 to 2019. Methods Chakaria, is a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in Southern Bangladesh. From 2004–2011 the HDSS covered a random sample of households; from 2012 to 2019 it covered a random sample of villages. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we calculated hazard ratios (HR) comparing mortality for children under 3 years of age after C-OPV versus before C-OPV to assess the effect of receiving a C-OPV. We allowed for different baseline hazard function in the two periods (2004–2011, 2012–2019), with separate models for each period. Findings There were 768 deaths (2.1%) amongst 36,176 children. The HR after C-OPV was 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.52–0.90). National campaigns providing vitamin A or measles vaccine did not have similar effects. Each additional dose of C-OPV was associated with a reduction in the mortality rate by 6% (−2 to 13%). The number needed to treat with C-OPV to save one life between 0 and 35 months of age was 88 (81–96). Interpretation This is the fourth study to show that C-OPV has beneficial non-specific effects on child survival. All studies have shown a beneficial effect of C-OPV on child health. Stopping OPV as planned after polio eradication without any mitigation plan could have detrimental effects for overall child health in low-income countries. Funding The Chakaria HDSS was funded by international sponsors. No sponsor had any influence on the preparation of the article."
17,17,10.1002/smll.202101133,,,Simultaneous Improvement of Efficiency and Stability of Organic Photovoltaic Cells by using a Cross-Linkable Fullerene Derivative,2021,"Improving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and stability are two main tasks for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. In the past few years, although the PCE of the OPV cells has been considerably improved, the research on device stability is limited. Herein, a cross-linkable material, cross-linked [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (c-PCBSD), is applied as an interfacial modification layer on the surface of zinc oxide and as the third component into the PBDB-TF:Y6-based OPV cells to enhance photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. The PCE of the OPV cells that underwent the two-step modification increased from 15.1 to 16.1%. In particular, such OPV cells exhibited much better stability under both thermal and air conditions because of the decreased number of interfacial defects and stable interfacial and active layer morphologies. The results demonstrated that the introduction of a cross-linkable fullerene derivative into the interfacial and active layers is a feasible method to improve the PCE and stability of OPV cells."
18,18,10.1002/aenm.202100342,,,Progress in Upscaling Organic Photovoltaic Devices,2021,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have recently undergone a rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) under AM1.5G conditions, as certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which have jumped from 11.5% in October 2017 to 18.2% in December 2020. However, the NREL certified PCE of large area OPV modules is still lagging far behind (11.7% in July 2020). Additionally, there has been a rapidly growing interest in the use of OPVs for dim light indoor applications, with reported PCE of some large area (≥1 cm2) devices, under 1000 lux, well above 20%. The transition of OPV from the lab to the market requires the development of effective manufacturing processes that can scale‐up laboratory‐scale devices into large area devices, without sacrificing performance and simultaneously minimizing associated manufacturing costs. This review article focuses on four important challenges that OPV technology has to face to achieve a reliable lab‐to‐fab transfer, namely: i) The upscaling of indium‐tin‐oxide (ITO)‐based single cells and the interconnection of single cells into large area modules; ii) the development of alternatives to vacuum processing; iii) the development of alternatives to ITO‐based substrates; and iv) strategies for improving the lifetime of large area OPV devices."
19,19,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105924,,,Photophysical pathways in efficient bilayer organic solar cells: The importance of interlayer energy transfer,2021,"Abstract The development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells has long been guided by the idea that excitons – bound electron-hole pairs created by light absorption – diffuse only 5–10 nm. True for many materials, this constraint led to an inherently complex device architecture – the bulk heterojunction – that has obscured our understanding of device physics, and handicapped rational material design. Here, we investigate the photophysics of a series of planar bilayer heterojunction devices incorporating fused-ring electron acceptors with power conversion efficiencies up to 11%. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate the importance of long-range layer-to-layer energy transfer in planar structures, isolating this effect by including an insulating layer between the donor and acceptor layers to eliminate charge transfer effects. We show that the slab geometry facilitates substantially longer-range energy transfer than between isolated molecules or small domains. Along with high molecular packing densities, high absorption coefficients, and long exciton diffusion lengths, we show that these effects amount to exciton harvesting length scales that match the light absorption lengths and thereby enable efficient bilayer devices. Our quantitative analysis of bilayer structures also accounts for large domain sizes in bulk-heterojunction devices including fused-ring electron acceptors, and it quantifies the importance of strong resonant spectral overlap is for material selection and design for highly efficient OPVs."
20,20,10.1093/cid/ciaa1351,,,National Immunization Campaigns With Oral Polio Vaccine May Reduce All-cause Mortality: An Analysis of 13 Years of Demographic Surveillance Data From an Urban African Area,2021,"BACKGROUND
Between 2002-2014, Guinea-Bissau had 17 national campaigns with oral polio vaccine (OPV) as well as campaigns with vitamin A supplementation (VAS), measles vaccine (MV), and H1N1-influenza vaccine. We examined the impact of these campaigns on child survival.


METHODS
We examined the mortality rate between day 1 and 3 years of age of all children in the study area. We used Cox models with age as underlying time to calculate adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) between ""after-campaign"" mortality and ""before-campaign"" mortality, adjusted for temporal change in mortality and stratified for season at risk.


RESULTS
Mortality was lower after OPV-only campaigns than before, the MRR for after-campaign vs. before-campaign being 0.75 (95% CI=0.67-0.85). Other campaigns did not have similar effects, the MRRs being 1.22 (1.04-1.44) for OPV+VAS campaigns, 1.39 (1.20-1.61) for VAS-only campaigns, 1.32 (1.09-1.60) for MV-with-VAS campaigns, and 1.13 (0.86-1.49) for the H1N1 campaign. Thus, all other campaigns differed significantly from the effect of OPV-only campaigns. Effects did not differ for trivalent, bivalent, or monovalent strains of OPV. With each additional campaign of OPV-only, the mortality rate declined further (MRR=0.86 (0.81-0.92) per campaign). With follow-up to 3 years of age, the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one life with campaign-OPV-only was 50 neonates.


CONCLUSION
OPV campaigns can have a much larger effect on child survival than otherwise assumed. Stopping OPV campaigns in low-income countries as part of the endgame for polio infection may increase child mortality."
21,21,10.1063/5.0048981,,,Studies of photoexcitations in polymer/non-fullerene blend for high-efficiency organic solar cells,2021,"We studied the photoexcitations properties in the blend of PBDB-T-SF, a donor π-conjugated copolymer, and ITIC-2F, a non-fullerene acceptor molecule, which is used as an active layer in high-performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells. We used several steady-state spectroscopies such as photoinduced absorption (PIA), photoluminescence (PL), magneto-photoinduced absorption (MPA), and magneto-PL in the pristine and blend films. The PIA spectra of the pristine copolymer and acceptor films contain a photoinduced absorption (PA) band due to triplet excitons, which is confirmed by the MPA(B) response, whereas the PIA spectrum of the copolymer/molecule blend contains several PA bands due to polaron pairs at the copolymer chain/molecule interfaces. Interestingly, when exciting the PIA spectrum of the blend at two different photon energies, namely, ℏ ω ≈ 2.39 eV that preferentially excites the copolymer chains and ℏ ω ≈ 1.58 eV that excites only the acceptor molecules, we found that the PIA spectra are the same. This shows that charge photogeneration is possible when exciting either the copolymer chains or the acceptor molecules, which might explain the high power conversion efficiency of OPV cells based on this blend. We also found from the MPA(B) responses of the pristine copolymer and acceptor films and their blend that the back reaction of the photogenerated polaron pairs into the copolymer forming triplet excitons is absent, further explaining the high power conversion efficiency of this blend as the active layer in OPV solar cells."
22,22,10.1016/j.solener.2021.03.025,,,Efficient fully roll-to-roll coated encapsulated organic solar module for indoor applications,2021,"Abstract The recent development of 5G networks has enabled the internet of things (IoT) to emerge as a key factor in the growing global data network. For the IoT, not only are sensors required, but also alternative ways to supply them with the energy they need. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a promising solution for energy harvesting and self-generation for low-consumption sensors since they have excellent physical, optical and electrical properties, including being lightweight, having shape freedom, broad-range absorption spectra, semi-transparency, and they are highly efficient even in extremely low-light environments. Here, we report, encapsulated OPV module optimized for indoor applications delivering 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under 400 lx LED illumination. All modules were fabricated and encapsulated in air using totally scalable roll-to-roll (R2R) slot-die coating and screen-printing methods made on flexible substrates with non-toxic solvents."
24,24,10.3390/polym13101640,,,Influence of the active layer structure on the photovoltaic performance of water-soluble polythiophene-based solar cells,2021,"A new side-chain C60-fullerene functionalized thiophene copolymer bearing tributylphosphine-substituted hexylic lateral groups was successfully synthesized by means of a fast and effective post-polymerization reaction on a regioregular ω-alkylbrominated polymeric precursor. The growth of the polymeric intermediate was followed by NMR spectrometry in order to determine the most convenient reaction time. The obtained copolymer was soluble in water and polar solvents and was used as a photoactive layer in single-material organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells. The copolymer photovoltaic efficiency was compared with that of an OPV cell containing a water-soluble polythiophenic homopolymer, functionalized with the same tributylphosphine-substituted hexylic side chains, in a blend with a water-soluble C60-fullerene derivative. The use of a water-soluble double-cable copolymer made it possible to enhance the control on the nanomorphology of the active blend, thus reducing phase-segregation phenomena, as well as the macroscale separation between the electron acceptor and donor components. Indeed, the power conversion efficiency of OPV cells based on a single material was higher than that obtained with the classical architecture, involving the presence of two distinct ED and EA materials (PCE: 3.11% vs. 2.29%, respectively). Moreover, the synthetic procedure adopted to obtain single material-based cells is more straightforward and easier than that used for the preparation of the homopolymer-based BHJ solar cell, thus making it possible to completely avoid the long synthetic pathway which is required to prepare water-soluble fullerene derivatives."
26,26,10.1016/j.synthmet.2021.116740,,,Non-radiative energy transfer in aqueously dispersed polymeric nanoparticles for photovoltaic applications,2021,"Abstract Polymeric nanoparticles dispersed in an aqueous medium were synthesized using the miniemulsion technique. In this study, nanoparticles composed of copolymer F8T2, homopolymer MDMO-PPV and a mixture of both were investigated aiming to unravel the interaction between these materials. By decreasing the distance between the nanostructured materials, higher Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was observed from F8T2 to MDMO-PPV. This enhanced energy transfer could generate more free charge carriers, increasing the short circuit current density, when the nanoparticles were applied as an active layer in organic photovoltaic devices, influencing the increase in the efficiency of these devices."
27,27,10.1016/j.orgel.2021.106091,,,Impure sexithiophene: The reality of supplied materials for organic electronic applications,2021,"Abstract Organic electronics are particularly susceptible to minor impurities within a materials sample because any amount of impurity can alter device performance. Here we outline and explore a specific example of how the sudden decrease in our organic solar cell (OSC) performance was attributed to purchased material with a minor impurity not acknowledged by an external supplier. Had there been no standard procedure in place to evaluate a new batch of materials, the issue could have gone unchecked and inadvertently affected other results in the future. In this specific example, we confirmed the presence of impurities in an alpha-sexithiophene sample purchased from a supplier that drastically affected baseline device data. Our goal is to bring awareness to the issue and emphasise the importance of verifying the purity of any materials purchased for organic electronics by establishing a baseline which would flag any major fabrication changes or the presence of impurities. We hope these analogous issues and methodologies are reported in pursuit of advancing the pace of research and development."
28,28,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125333,,,Use of hybrid renewable energy system with organic photovoltaic cells in zinc electrowinning,2021,"Abstract This work evaluates the use of customized hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) with organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells for producing a high-purity metal by electrowinning. This process usually represents the most energy intensive step in the mining industry. A key advantage about the developed system is that the electric charge is inherently generated as direct current (DC), which can be directly supplied to the electrowinning cells without using intermediate rectifiers. This approach eliminates the energy losses associated, thus increasing the overall efficiency of the power system, and decreases the carbon footprint of the industrial facility. In this context, the main purpose of this first work was to evaluate the energy saving performance of the technology and its application to produce a quality product, which was characterized by morphology, crystal structure and bending behavior. The electrowinning of zinc was selected as case study. Thus, zinc electrodeposition tests were conducted under conditions practiced in industrial operations. The results demonstrated the proper functioning of the HRES system, since constant DC current was supplied to the process. The zinc cathodes exhibited morphology and structure typically described in the literature, which were ductile enough to allow bending without fracturing. On days with global horizontal irradiances in the range from 100 W m-2 to 1200 W m-2, 26±4% of the total current supplied to the electrowinning cell was generated by the OPV cells used in this work. In Brazil, this performance corresponds to carbon mitigation of about 6.4x10-2 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq) per ton of zinc produced. These findings indicate that hybrid systems with photovoltaic cells represent an alternative to save energy and increase the sustainability of electrowinning processes."
29,29,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.15.044054,,,Exciton Heating Versus Cooling: Charge Separation Driven by Entropy and Delocalization at Interfaces with Planar Molecules,2021,"The recent development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has resulted in an abrupt increase in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiency. It remains unclear why charge separation (CS) can occur at a high yield in NFA OPVs despite the small energy-level offset at the donor-acceptor (D-A) interface. $\mathrm{In}$ order to resolve this issue, zinc phtholacyanine (ZnPc) and its fluorinated derivative (${\mathrm{F}}_{8}\mathrm{Zn}\mathrm{Pc}$) are used to build a model D-A interface for understanding the mechanism underlying the efficient CS in NFA OPVs. At this interface, we find that bound charge-transfer (CT) excitons can undergo a heating process in which the enthalpy increases at a surprisingly fast rate. Specifically, the CT exciton gains 0.3 eV from the environment in merely 10 ps. This fast exciton heating, which eventually leads to CS, resembles the CS behavior observed in NFA bulk heterojunctions (BHJs). Interestingly, when the pair of D-A molecules switches from a face-on to an edge-on orientation, the CT-exciton heating process is reversed to the typical hot CT-exciton cooling process in which the enthalpy decreases with time. By using sub-band-gap excitation, we further find that the exciton heating can occur directly from cold CT excitons without the need of excess energy provided by the energy-level offset. The competition between the exciton heating and cooling is explained by a model that incorporates the effect of entropy, electron delocalization, and structural anisotropy. It is found that for the face-on orientation, the small contact area between the delocalized electron and hole within the CT exciton significantly reduces the number of cold CT states, which increases the entropic driving force and drives the reaction into the heating direction. This finding provides insight on why the entropy-and-delocalization-driven CS would preferentially occur in NFA BHJs. The relative orientation of the NFA molecular stack and the polymer chain, together with bulky side groups, make the delocalized electron and hole in contact with each other via isolated pointlike junctions, which is the key for activating the exciton heating and subsequent CS."
30,30,10.3390/molecules26072012,,,Conducting silicone-based polymers and their application,2021,"Over the past two decades, both fundamental and applied research in conducting polymers have grown rapidly. Conducting polymers (CPs) are unique due to their ease of synthesis, environmental stability, and simple doping/dedoping chemistry. Electrically conductive silicone polymers are the current state-of-the-art for, e.g., optoelectronic materials. The combination of inorganic elements and organic polymers leads to a highly electrically conductive composite with improved thermal stability. Silicone-based materials have a set of extremely interesting properties, i.e., very low surface energy, excellent gas and moisture permeability, good heat stability, low-temperature flexibility, and biocompatibility. The most effective parameters constructing the physical properties of CPs are conjugation length, degree of crystallinity, and intra- and inter-chain interactions. Conducting polymers, owing to their ease of synthesis, remarkable environmental stability, and high conductivity in the doped form, have remained thoroughly studied due to their varied applications in fields like biological activity, drug release systems, rechargeable batteries, and sensors. For this reason, this review provides an overview of organosilicon polymers that have been reported over the past two decades."

Herein, a series of ternary OPVs were fabricated by employing a wide bandgap donor (PBDB-TF) and two acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A)-type nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs, called F-2Cl and 3TT-OCIC). As the third component, the near-infrared SMA, 3TT-OCIC, has complementary absorption spectrum, narrow bandgap and well-compatible crystallization property to the host acceptor (F-2Cl) for efficient ternary OPVs. With these, the optimal ternary devices yield significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.23%, one of the very few examples with PCE higher than 15% other than Y6 systems. This is mainly attributed to the increased short-circuit current density of 24.92 mA cm−2 and dramatically decreased energy loss of 0.53 eV. This work presents a successful example for simultaneously improving current, minimizing energy loss and together with modifying the morphology of active layers in OPVs, which will contribute to the further construction of high performance ternary OPVs."

Fluorine-substituted benzotriazole (2F-BTA) was incorporated into 4,8-bis(4-chlorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT-T-Cl) and a 1,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-alkyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD)-based alternating copolymer PM7 as a third monomeric unit. The solubility of the random terpolymers in nonhalogenated solvents increased with the number of 2F-BTA units in PM7. The random terpolymers were mixed with 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2',3'-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene (IT-4F) to fabricate organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Among the three terpolymers and two related binary copolymers (e.g., PM7 and J52-Cl), outdoor photovoltaic (PV) cells (AM 1.5G) based on the PJ-50:IT-4F blend showed a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.34%. In addition, PJ-50 was employed as a donor in indoor PV (IPV) cells and was blended with nonfullerene acceptors, which have different absorption ranges. Among them, the PJ-50:IT-4F-based IPV device had the highest PCE of 17.41% with a Jsc of 54.75 μA cm-2 and an FF of 0.77 under 160 μW cm-2 light-emitting diode (LED) light. The terpolymer introduced in this study can be regarded as a promising material for the fabrication of outdoor PV and IPV cells with excellent performance involving the use of an eco-friendly solvent."
33,33,10.1021/jacs.0c13352,,,Nonradiative Triplet Loss Suppressed in Organic Photovoltaic Blends with Fluoridated Nonfullerene Acceptors,2021,"In organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends, photogenerated excitons dissociate into charge-separated electrons and holes at donor/acceptor interfaces. The bimolecular recombination of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes may cause nonradiative loss by forming the low-lying triplet excited states (T1) via the intermediate charge-transfer triplet states. Here, we show that such a spin-related loss channel can be suppressed in the OPV blends with fluorinated nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). By combining ultrafast optical spectroscopy and triplet sensitization measurements, the T1 states at the acceptors have been observed to generate from the charge-separated electrons and holes in the OPV blends with a same polymer donor and two sets of NFAs with and without fluorination. The triplet formation is largely suppressed and the lifetime of charge carrier is markedly prolonged in the blends with fluorinated NFAs. The fluorination effect on the charge dynamics can be ascribed to the modified energy alignment between the triplet excited states of charge-transfer and locally excited characters as supported by quantum chemical computation. Our findings explain the mechanism responsible for the improved photocurrent generation in the OPV blends with fluorinated NFAs, suggesting that manipulating the energy landscape of triplet excited states is a promising strategy for further optimizing OPV devices."
34,34,10.1088/1742-6596/1723/1/012017,,,Theoretical study of the open circuit voltage decay on Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells based on space radiation ionizing damage,2021,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells have progressed quite significantly as an affordable energy technology, with high-throughput roll-to-roll solution processing driving down costs to the point of competitiveness with current technologies. They potentially offer significant advantages over classical inorganic semiconductor cells; specifically, down costs, lightness, flexibility and controlled donor-acceptor film composition. Our specific interest is based on the applicability of organic photovoltaics cells for use in space based solar panels. The present work is a theoretical study of ionizing radiation effects in the organic photovoltaic structure P3HT: PCBM for total accumulated doses up to 1kGy (SiO2). We find that the open circuit voltage (Voc) varies with the accumulation of irradiation; however, other parameters such as relaxation time, short circuit current, and charge carrier density remain to first order constant. At the interface, the energetic mismatch of the molecular orbitals provides enough driving force to split the exciton in order to create free charge carriers (an electron (e-) and the corresponding hole (h+)). This is consistent with observations on preirradiation cases that depend directly on the Voc, due to carriers and quasi states; this leads to a linear recombination according to the Dose Damage Displacement (Dd) and Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL). Finally, we conclude that the organic photovoltaics will survive in a space environment up to 1 kGy (SiO2), contrary to popular belief that organics would be radiation “soft.”"

Through a careful selection of a third component, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device based on PM6/Y6/layered PTQ10 layered third-component structure was 16.8%, being higher than those of corresponding devices incorporating the PM6/Y6/PTQ10 BHJ ternary blend (16.1%) and the PM6/Y6 BHJ binary blend (15.5%). Also, the device featuring PM7/Y1-4F/layered PTQ10 layered third-component structure gave a PCE of 15.2%, which is higher than the PCEs of the devices incorporating the PM7/Y1-4F/PTQ10 BHJ ternary blend and the PM7/Y1-4F BHJ binary blend (14.2 and 14.0%, respectively). These enhancements in PCE based on layered third-component structure can be attributed to improvements in the charge separation and charge collection abilities. This simple concept of the layered third-component structure appears to have great promise for achieving high-performance OPVs."

The OPV efficiency is increasing closing the gap against silicon-based modules. This article describes an experimental campaign performed at SolarTechLAB to assess the performance of six OPV modules in real environmental conditions (module nominal power 17.5 Wp). The first part of the activity was dedicated to the photoactivation process, which is a well-known phenomenon of this kind of modules. Measurements pointed out that the OPV modules reach stable conditions after collecting 10 kWh/m2 of solar radiation independently from the module conditions during the procedure. A second relevant result is about the reversibility of the photoactivation process: experiments showed that activated modules left in the dark for several days lose the activation indicating the reversibility of the process. Finally, in the second part, the performances of the six OPV modules have been analyzed and benchmarked against silicon (c-Si) and CIS photovoltaic technology. The measured electric efficiency of the six OPV modules under real environmental conditions was below 4%, which is significantly lower than 20% and 15% measured for c-Si and CIS modules under the same conditions."

Here, eight donor-π-acceptor-π-donor conjugated OPV materials entailing guaiazulene or naphthalene as electron donor unit were synthesized and characterized. The azulenyl and naphthyl groups have significant influences on their molecular properties and photovoltaic performances. Compared to naphthalene derivatives, azulene derivatives exhibit red-shifted and wider absorption spectra. However, naphthalene derivatives exhibit much deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, higher hole mobility and better film morphology, remarkably resulting in approximately 2–4 times higher photovoltaic efficiencies than azulene derivatives."
40,40,10.1021/acsami.0c17865,,,Ionically gated small-molecule OPV: Interfacial doping of charge collector and transport layer,2021,"We demonstrate an improvement in the performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems based on small molecules by ionic gating via controlled reversible n-doping of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) coated on fullerene electron transport layers (ETLs): C60 and C70. Such electric double-layer charging (EDLC) doping, achieved by ionic liquid (IL) charging, allows tuning of the electronic concentration in MWCNTs and the fullerene planar acceptor layers, increasing it by orders of magnitude. This leads to the decrease of the series and increase of the shunt resistances of OPVs and allows use of thick (up to 200 nm) ETLs, increasing the durability of OPVs. Two stages of OPV enhancement are described upon the increase of gating bias Vg: at small (or even zero) Vg, the extended interface of ILs and porous transparent MWCNTs is charged by gating, and the fullerene charge collector is significantly improved, becoming an ohmic contact. This changes the S-shaped J-V curve via improving the electron collection by an n-doped MWCNT cathode with an ohmic interfacial contact. The J-V curves further improve at higher gating bias Vg due to the increase of the Fermi level and decrease of the MWCNT work function. At the next qualitative stage, the acceptor fullerene layer becomes n-doped by electron injection from MWCNTs while ions of ILs penetrate into the fullerene. At this step, the internal built-in field is created within OPV, which helps in exciton dissociation and charge separation/transport, increasing further the Jsc and the fill factor. The ionic gating concept demonstrated here for most simple classical planar small-molecule OPV cells can be potentially applied to more complex highly efficient hybrid devices, such as perovskite photovoltaic with an ETL or a hole transport layer, providing a new way to tune their properties via controllable and reversible interfacial doping of charge collectors and transport layers."

Here, we demonstrate automated OPV material and device characterization in terms of efficiency and photostability. Gaussian process regression (GPR) prediction based on optical absorption features guided the optimization process with promising prediction accuracy for PV parameters and burn-in losses. With ∼100 process conditions, screening for efficiency and photostability can be finished within 70 h. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14% was achieved by fully automated device fabrication in air with a model material system PM6:Y6. Improving molecular ordering has been identified as the most promising motif for further efficiency optimization. Thin active layers combined with medium thermal annealing temperature are favorable to simultaneously improve efficiency and suppress burn-in losses. The platform and protocol may be expanded to any solution-processed organic semiconductor and interface materials."
42,42,10.1016/j.orgel.2020.106046,,,Silver-nanowire-based lamination electrode for a fully vacuum-free and solution-processed organic photovoltaic cell,2021,"Abstract A silver nanowire (AgNW)-based stacked lamination electrode was investigated for application as the top electrode in fully vacuum-free and solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) fabrication. AgNW layers were stacked with an ethylene-glycol-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer for conductivity enhancement and uniform contact creation, and an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) adhesive and a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) supporting film with subsequent hot-pressing were used for complete attachment (good electrical contact). During hot-pressing at 100 °C, the melted EVA adhesive was found to create a concrete electrical contact between the lamination electrode and the underlying polymer semiconducting layer. To verify the performance of the lamination electrode, fully vacuum-free and solution-processed OPVs with the lamination electrode were fabricated and compared to OPVs with a reference evaporated metal electrode. The results revealed that the OPVs with lamination electrodes provided the best fill factor (FF) of 53% and a final photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.61%, whereas the OPVs with metal electrodes provided the best FF of 64% and a PCE of 3.41%. Analytical calculations indicate that the FF loss of lamination electrode OPVs was due to higher series resistance (11.4 Ω-cm2 vs. 15.1 Ω-cm2) and higher recombination at the interface, which can be considered an ideality factor (1.7 vs. 2.7)."
43,43,10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01157,,,Transfer Learned Designer Polymers for Organic Solar Cells,2021,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials have been examined extensively over the past two decades for solar cell applications because of the potential for device flexibility, low-temperature solution processability, and negligible environmental impact. However, discovery of new candidate OPV materials, especially polymer-based electron donors, that demonstrate notable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), is nontrivial and time-intensive exercise given the extensive set of possible chemistries. Recent progress in machine learning accelerated materials discovery has facilitated to address this challenge, with molecular line representations, such as Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry Systems (SMILES), gaining popularity as molecular fingerprints describing the donor chemical structures. Here, we employ a transfer learning based recurrent neural (LSTM) model, which harnesses the SMILES molecular fingerprints as an input to generate novel designer chemistries for OPV devices. The generative model, perfected on a small focused OPV data set, predicts new polymer repeat units with potentially high PCE. Calculations of the similarity coefficient between the known and the generated polymers corroborate the accuracy of the model predictability as a function of the underlying chemical specificity. The data-enabled framework is sufficiently generic for use in accelerated machine learned materials discovery for various chemistries and applications, mining the hitherto available experimental and computational data."
45,45,10.1039/d0qm00581a,,,Recent progress in reducing voltage loss in organic photovoltaic cells,2021,"Compared with inorganic or perovskite photovoltaic cells, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells often exhibit larger voltage losses, which hinders improvements in their efficiency. The unwanted voltage losses are mainly caused by the driving force for charge generation and non-radiative recombination. In recent years, with the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the voltage losses of OPV cells have been significantly suppressed, contributing to a boost in efficiency. Two aspects help to decrease voltage loss: (1) many OPV cells based on NFAs possess high-efficiency charge generation under aligned energy levels between the donor and acceptor, almost eliminating the driving forces in charge generation; (2) the illumination efficiencies of active layer blends containing NFAs are vastly improved, thus decreasing the non-radiative recombination loss. In this review, we summarize the recent progress achieved in the reduction of voltage losses in OPV cells. First, we present a brief background of voltage loss in different types of photovoltaic cells. Second, we discuss the latest research results, such as the charge generation mechanism under low donor–acceptor energy offsets and how non-radiative loss can be suppressed via tuning the charge transfer state. Finally, we provide insight into the design of highly efficient OPV materials that may be achieved via further decreases in voltage loss."
47,47,10.3390/app11020755,,,The effects of molecular packing behavior of small-molecule acceptors in ternary organic solar cells,2021,"Herein, two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based, small-molecule isomers, oand p-DPPPhCN, were introduced as acceptors in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). The isomers have the same molecular backbone but differ in the positions of the cyanide (CN) substituents (ortho and para), which greatly affects their packing behavior. Ternary solar cells composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):DPP-PhCN:phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were fabricated, and the effects of the different packing behaviors of the third component on the device performance and the working mechanism of the ternary cells were investigated. The addition of o-DPP-PhCN with a relatively high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level resulted in an increase in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) in the ternary devices, demonstrating the alloy-like structure of the two acceptors (o-DPP-PhCN and PCBM) in the ternary system. However, the p-DPP-PhCN-based ternary cells exhibited VOC values similar to that of a P3HT:PCBM binary cell, irrespective of the addition of p-DPP-PhCN, indicating a cascade energy-level structure in the ternary system and an effective charge transfer from the P3HT to the PCBM. Importantly, by increasing the addition of p-DPPPhCN, the short-circuit current density increased substantially, resulting in pronounced shoulder peaks in the external quantum efficiency responses in the long-wavelength region, corresponding to the contribution of the photocurrent generated by the light absorption of p-DPP-PhCN. Despite sharing the same molecular backbone, the two DPP-PhCNs exhibited substantially different packing behaviors according to the position of their CN substituents, which also greatly affected the working mechanism of the ternary devices fabricated using the DPP-PhCNs as the third component."

In this work, highly efficient double-junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx /Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB-TF:ITCC and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx /Ag/ZnO:PFN-Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine-tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB-TF:BTP-eC11 blend films, the 300 nm-thick PBDB-TF:BTP-eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub-cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology."

The COVID-19 pandemic is a globalized health concern caused by a beta-coronavirus named Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since, December 2019 when this outbreak flared in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 cases have been continuously rising all over the world. Due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, subsequent waves are flowing in a faster manner as compared to the primary wave, which is more contagious and causing higher mortality around the world. Recently, India has emerged as the new epicenter of the second wave by mutants of SARS-CoV-2. After almost eighteen months of this outbreak, some COVID-19 dedicated therapeutics and vaccines are available, and a few are under trial, but the situation is still uncontrolled. To manage the current scenario this study suggested that the repurposing of the childhood vaccines should be considered as a preventive option along with the available COVID-19 therapeutic and vaccinesbecause childhood vaccines exert the non-specific or heterologous protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infections.

EXPERT OPINION
This perspective article has suggested that combinatorial use of these childhood vaccines might exert a better protective effect along with the available COVID-19 therapeutic and vaccineswhichcould be considered as a preventive option against SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as its subsequent waves."

However, little is known about the relaxation of charge carriers, which is key to efficient charge transport. Herein, we report simultaneous time-of-flight (TOF) and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements employing benzodithiophene-based polymer (PBDB-T):soluble C 70 -fullerere (PCBM) and PBDB-T:NFA (ITIC or Y6) blends, as benchmark systems. In addition to the conventional TOF mobilities, relaxation of the hole and electron mobility was evaluated by TRMC under an external electric field. Although PBDB-T:ITIC exhibited much faster relaxation than PBDB-T:PCBM, the relaxation in PBDB-T:Y6 was considerably moderate. This is consistent with the energetic disorder estimated from the photoabsorption onset. Interestingly, the slower relaxation of the electrons compared to the holes in PBDB-T:Y6 is in line with the preferred normal device structure. Our work deepens the understanding of the energetics of polymer:NFA blends and offers a basis for achieving efficient NFA properties."

The tandem or multijunction structure undoubtedly offers an efficient way to boost the performance of OSCs. This work has explored the optical modeling of different organic photoactive materials to identify the potential materials for efficient tandem structure. The performance of double, triple, and quadruple junction tandem OSCs with suitable bandgaps has been analyzed with photoactive materials. The absorption efficiency enhances considerably using the thickness optimization of each subcell in tandem structures. Current matching in all subcells, an essential factor for efficient device operation, is taken into account while optimizing tandem structures.

57,57,10.1093/NSR/NWZ200,,,Organic photovoltaic cell with 17% efficiency and superior processability,2021,"The development of organic photoactive materials, especially the newly emerging non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs), has enabled rapid progress in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells in recent years. Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the top-performance OPV cells have surpassed 16%, the devices are usually fabricated via a spin-coating method and are not suitable for large-area production. Here, we demonstrate that the fine-modification of the flexible side chains of NFAs can yield 17% PCE for OPV cells. More crucially, as the optimal NFA has a suitable solubility and thus a desirable morphology, the high efficiencies of spin-coated devices can be maintained when using scalable blade-coating processing technology. Our results suggest that optimization of the chemical structures of the OPV materials can improve device performance. This has great significance in larger-area production technologies that provide important scientific insights for the commercialization of OPV cells."

The low-cost large-area encapsulation technique of stability improvement of flexible OPV module is under-investigated. The related reports on flexible encapsulation up-scaled from cell were limited. The present study develops an effective and easy encapsulation method and architecture design based on the inverted structure of ambient R2R slot-die-coated PET/ITO/ZnO/active layer/hole transport layer (HTL)/Ag. All module areas are greater than 48 cm2. The P3HT:PCBM and PV2000:PC71BM adopted as active layers have the performance conversion efficiencies of modules of 1–2.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The thermally-deposited MoO3 and slot-die-coated PEDOT:PSS HTLs are used to compare the effect of HTL on T80 lifetime of the large-area flexible R2R module under the accelerated test. The accelerated stability tests regarding to different encapsulation architectures, including damp-heat and light soaking stresses, were conducted. The intrinsic and extrinsic degradation effects are analyzed. We develop the simple encapsulation design effectively suppressing the lateral ingress of oxygen and moisture. The T80 lifetime of P3HT:PCBM-based module can be improved to be 1500 h under the damp-heat test (65 °C/65% RH). The T80 lifetime of PV2000:PC71BM-based module can last for 7000 h under the dark and ambient environment (30 °C/50 ± 20% RH)."
62,62,10.1021/acsami.0c14922,,,Optimization of the Bulk Heterojunction of All-Small-Molecule Organic Photovoltaics Using Design of Experiment and Machine Learning Approaches,2020,"All-small-molecule organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based upon the small-molecule donor, DRCN5T, and nonfullerene acceptors, ITIC, IT-M, and IT-4F, were optimized using Design of Experiments (DOE) and machine learning (ML) approaches. This combination enables rational sampling of large parameter spaces in a sparse but mathematically deliberate fashion and promises economies of precious resources and time. This work focused upon the optimization of the core layer of the OPV device, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Many experimental processing parameters play critical roles in the overall efficiency of a given device and are often correlated and thus are difficult to parse individually. DOE was applied to the (i) solution concentration of the donor and acceptor ink used for spin-coating, (ii) the donor fraction, (iii) the temperature, and (iv) duration of the annealing of these films. The ML-based approach was then used to derive maps of the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) landscape for the first and second rounds of optimization to be used as guides to determine the optimal values of experimental processing parameters with respect to PCE. This work shows that with little knowledge of a potential combination of components for a given BHJ, a large parameter space can be effectively screened and investigated to rapidly determine its potential for high-efficiency OPVs."

In this work, we blended a stable acceptor (O-IDTBR) with two photostable donors (PTB7-Th and PffBT4T-2OD) having different polymer crystallinity, and the resulting devices show a significant difference in the OPV degradation rate. The OPV devices employing a highly crystalline polymer PffBT4T-2OD as an active layer show a good resistance against light soaking, maintaining 80% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 100 hours, while the devices employing an amorphous polymer PTB7-Th as an active layer show a significant PCE loss in the initial 20 hours mainly due to a rapid loss of the fill factor. By carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the device degradation mechanisms, we conclude that the origin for the PTB7-Th:O-IDTBR device degradation is the formation of mid-gap states under continuous sunlight illumination, leading to a significant drop in electron mobility. Device simulation revealed that deep traps act as charge recombination centers and increase the trap-assisted recombination rate, lowering the FF and Jsc."

However, there are a very large number of potential donors and acceptors, making selection of the best materials difficult. Here, we show that machine-learning approaches can leverage computationally expensive DFT calculations to estimate important OPV materials properties quickly and accurately. We generate quantitative relationships between simple and interpretable chemical signature and one-hot descriptors and OPV power conversion efficiency (PCE), open circuit potential ( V oc ), short circuit density ( J sc ), highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, and the HOMO–LUMO gap. The most robust and predictive models could predict PCE (computed by DFT) with a standard error of ±0.5 for percentage PCE for both the training and test set. This model is useful for pre-screening potential donor and acceptor materials for OPV applications, accelerating design of these devices for green energy applications."

The inorganic filler material CZTS QDs with P3HT:PCBH matrix, forms double bulk hetero junction (BHJ) throughout in the active layer, which facilitates rapid exciton dissocitaion process at P3HT:PCBH and CZTS:PCBH interfaces that results effective charge carrier separation. The prepared active layer material has been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and fourier transform infra red (FTIR). The enhanced optical absorbance of prepared hybrid structure has been verified by UV–Visible analysis. It has been observed that the improvement in photo conversion efficiency (PCE) from 2.36% for the solar cell device P3HT:PCBH to 4.12% for CZTS QD based P3HT:PCBH hybrid organic solar cell device. This dramtaic increase in PCE, is mainly due to the significant enhancement in short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 7.6 mA/cm2 to 11.2 mA/cm2. That suggests, the incorporation of p-type kesterite CZTS QDs into P3HT:PCBH polymer matrix enhances the effective exciton dissociation at interfaces resulting charge separation and their fast extraction to electrodes inhibiting e−/h+ pair recombination. Furthermore, the hybrid solar cell shows remarkable time stability retaining 80% of original PCE measured after 30 days under ambient environment conditions. The hybrid organic solar cell device shows thermal stability by retaining 95.6% of its intial efficiency measured which has been tested in the temperature range 20–80 °C."
67,67,10.1007/s11771-020-4501-0,,,A new chlorinated non-fullerene acceptor based organic photovoltaic cells over 12% efficiency,2020,"The method to fluorinate the terminal group has achieved remarkable success and been widely used to fine-tune the intrinsic properties of organic acceptor materials. Referring to chlorination, however, it gets less attention and remains ambiguous effect on organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Herein, a new non-fullerene acceptor named Y19 was reported with benzotriazole as the electron-deficient core and 2Cl-ICs as the strong electron-withdrawing end groups. Y19 exhibits a wide film absorption band from 600 nm to 948 nm and low LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level of −3.95 eV Photovoltaic devices based on PM6:Y19 show high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.76 % with high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.84 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.38 mA/cm2 and fill factor (FF) of 68.18 %. Broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) response of over 60 % in the range of 480–860 nm can be obtained. This study demonstrates that chlorination, as a low-cost molecular design strategy, has its own superiorities to improve device performance and promote the potential application in OPV."
68,68,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105342,,,Enhancing the stability of organic photovoltaics through machine learning,2020,"Abstract A machine learning approach for extracting information from organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cell data is presented. A database consisting of 1850 entries of device characteristics, performance and stability data is utilised and a sequential minimal optimisation regression (SMOreg) model is employed as a means of determining the most influential factors governing the solar cell stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). This is achieved through the analysis of the acquired SMOreg model in terms of the attribute weights. Significantly, the analysis presented allows for identification of materials which could lead to improvements in stability and PCE for each thin film in the device architecture, as well as highlighting the role of different stress factors in the degradation of OPVs. It is found that, for tests conducted under ISOS-L protocols the choice of light spectrum and the active layer material significantly govern the stability, whilst for tests conducted under ISOS-D protocols, the primary attributes are material and encapsulation dependent. The reported approach affords a rapid and efficient method of applying machine learning to enable material identification that possess the best stability and performance. Ultimately, researchers and industries will be able to obtain invaluable information for developing future OPV technologies so that can be realised in a significantly shorter period by reducing the need for time-consuming experimentation and optimisation."
70,70,10.1039/d0tc03087b,,,Charge transport and mobility relaxation in organic bulk heterojunction morphologies derived from electron tomography measurements,2020,"The charge carrier mobility is one of the most critical electronic materials properties that determines the ultimate performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. However, it is also a property with complex dependencies on the charge carrier density, electric field, lengthscale, and timescale, which can each vary depending on the chemical structure, molecular order and orientation, phase morphology, etc. These issues have made it extremely challenging to develop quantitative structure–property relationships that would allow rational molecular and materials design for next generation OPVs. Using a unique combination of advanced experimental morphology characterization (electron tomography) and recently developed open-source computational tools for morphology analysis and kinetic Monte Carlo charge transport simulations, we investigate how the microstructural features in real bulk heterojunction blends impact charge transport physics. This work demonstrates that simulated charge transport in real morphologies can differ significantly from that found with the commonly used Ising-based model. However, most significantly, there are fundamental differences in the mobility relaxation dynamics between homogeneous neat materials and bulk heterojunction blends. The tortuosity of the bulk heterojunction domain network causes electric-field-induced dispersion that can significantly prolong the mobility relaxation dynamics. These morphological effects must be considered when analyzing experimental mobility results and when choosing the appropriate measurement technique."

The reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), based on high performance light-harvesting materials, have been close to the requirement of practical application. However, scaling up and processability of the materials have become one of the main barriers inhibiting the OPV commercialization. In order to provide ideas for solving the cost issue, a series of low-cost p-type copolymers, PTV-X (X represents different alkyl side chains) with copolymerization of thienylene and vinylene as backbones, are prepared and characterized. It was demonstrated that PTV-based materials possess almost flat structure and broad absorption spectra range from 300 to 750 nm. Besides, the hole mobilities of the optimized materials are up to magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Importantly, the PTV-X family polymers can work effectively with various representative fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. A regioregular polymer, namely PTVT-C12, is synthesized based on monomers of (thiophene-vinylene-thiophene) TVT-C12 and V–Sn to further modulate the morphological properties of the PTV-series polymers. The more ordered chain packing was observed in PTVT-C12 film and enhanced charge carrier mobility was realized in PTVT-C12 based OSC device. As a result, a PCE of 6.44% is exhibited by the device based on PTVT-C12: BO-4Cl. This study suggests that PTV-series materials are being worthy of consideration for the development of low-cost materials for the future OPV commercialization."

74,74,10.1039/d0se00971g,,,Molecular insights into photostability of fluorinated organic photovoltaic blends: role of fullerene electron affinity and donor-acceptor miscibility,2020,"In this work, the photostability of certain organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layers was demonstrated to improve by as much as a factor of five under white light illumination in air with the use of 1,7-bis-trifluoromethylfullerene (C60(CF3)2) as the acceptor in place of PC60BM. However, the results were highly dependent on the structure and functionality within the donor material. Twelve combinations of active layer blends were studied, comprised of six different high-performance donor polymers (two fluorinated and four non-fluorinated donors) and two fullerene acceptors (PC60BM and C60(CF3)2). The relative rates of irreversible photobleaching of the active layer blends were found to correlate well with the electron affinity of the fullerene when the polymer and fullerene were well blended, but a full rationalization of the photobleaching data requires consideration of both the electron affinity of the fullerene as well as the relative miscibility of the polymer–fullerene components in the blend. Miscibility of those components was probed using a combination of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging. The presence of fluorinated aromatic units in the donor materials tend to promote more intimate mixing with C60(CF3)2 as compared to PC60BM. The full results of these photobleaching studies and measurements of donor–acceptor miscibility, considered alongside additional photoconductance measurements and preliminary device work, provide new molecular optimization insights for improving the long-term stability of OPV active layers."

At the same time, the scale-up of fabrication entails careful evaluation and selection of solvents, and optimization of processing parameters. It has been proven that using proper processing additives in polymer:PCBM bulk-heterojunction solution is one of the most effective strategies to improve the performance of organic photovoltaic cells. Here we report a new transition solvent strategy of using non-halogenated solvents to fabricate PDTSTPD: PC71BM based active layers. This strategy uses a combination of miscible good main solvent such as 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and coadditives such as diphenyl ether (DPE) and 1-methylnaphtalene (MeN) for middle molecular weight PDTSTPD, or 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and MeN for high molecular weight PDTSTPD to tune the nano-scale morphology of the active layer during the film drying process. Inverted organic photovoltaic cells with an active area of 1cm2 on PET substrate fabricated by a blade coating process using the formulated ink have demonstrated a power conversion efficiency up to 5 %."

To improve upon the current state of interfacial transport models, we augment the existing classical models of dielectric interfaces by incorporating results from ab initio calculations, allowing us to calculate exciton and polaron binding energies more accurately. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of this new model using two interfaces: (i) the boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and C60 interface, which is an archetype for many organic photovoltaic devices; and (ii) pentacene and silicon (100), which represents a hybrid between organic and inorganic semiconductors. Our calculations predict that the insertion of molecular dipoles at interfaces can be used for improving polaron pair dissociation and that sharp transitions in dielectric permittivity can have a stronger effect on the polaron pair dissociation than even the electron-hole Coulomb interaction."

However, increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still challenging. In this paper, response surface methodology of design of experiments (DOE) is used to optimize the PCE of a tandem organic solar cell. The cell is based on boron sub-phthalocyanine to reduce the series resistance between the layers. The optimization process is performed by formulating an empirical polynomial regression model relating the PCE to the active layers' thicknesses. Design Expert software is used for model adequacy checking, response surface plotting and response optimization. The optimized thicknesses resulted in increasing the PCE by 47.7% compared to the conversion rate of the monolayered solar cell of the same materials."

MOFs are three-dimensional materials made up of secondary building blocks comprised of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands whereas COFs are 2D or 3D highly porous organic solids made up by light elements (i.e., H, B, C, N, O). Both MOFs and COFs, being highly conjugated scaffolds, are very promising as photoactive materials for applications in photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis because of their tunable electronic properties, high surface area, remarkable light and thermal stability, easy and relative low-cost synthesis, and structural versatility. These properties make them perfectly suitable for photovoltaic application: throughout this review, we summarize recent advances in the employment of both MOFs and COFs in emerging photovoltaics, namely dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) organic photovoltaic (OPV) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). MOFs are successfully implemented in DSSCs as photoanodic material or solid-state sensitizers and in PSCs mainly as hole or electron transporting materials. An innovative paradigm, in which the porous conductive polymer acts as standing-alone sensitized photoanode, is exploited too. Conversely, COFs are mostly implemented as photoactive material or as hole transporting material in PSCs."

A combination of P3HT: PCBM with parallel vertical LiF cylinders formulate the active material structure. The collection efficiency in the active material reaches 92.2%. The operating wavelength where the maximum collection efficiency occurs is adjusted and matched with the wavelength where the maximum irradiance of the solar spectrum occurs.

However, the studies on the essential fundamental issues are still insufficiency under low light. Thus, the properties of OPV cells for low light applications need further clarification. Here, we systematically studied the effect of series resistance (Rs) on the PBDB-TF:IT-M-based device by introducing external Rs and tuning active layer thickness. Regardless of enlarging external Rs or increasing active layer thickness, the efficiencies were observably improved under low light, compared with the AM 1.5G condition. The phenomenon can be mainly attributed to impressive fill factor (FF) under low light due to the restrained recombination processes. Furthermore, we provided the energy distribution through the optical analysis for the OPV cells. The fabricated OPV cells (4 cm2) via the blade-coating method output an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.2% and 10.5% with optimal thicknesses of 181 ± 37 nm under weak LED light and 0.5% sun, respectively, which are significantly higher than the value of 5.02% under the AM 1.5G condition.

In this study, we evaluated the role played by the small molecule Y6 as the third component in additive-free PM6 (polymer): Y6:IT-4F (small molecule) ternary OPVs. We used UV–Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and tapping-mode atomic force microscopy to study the effects of various blend ratios on the optoelectronic properties of these OPVs. At the optimized PM6:Y6:IT-4F blend ratio (1:0.35:0.75), we observed the presence of Y6:IT-4F intermediates that efficiently suppressed the over-segregation of Y6 and increased the degree of carrier transport. The optimized ternary OPV delivered an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.6 ± 0.29% and the best PCE of 14.14%, which was 23% enhancement compared with the binary OPV. The findings suggest that dual effects, caused by the use of solvent and optimization of the blending ratio of primary and secondary acceptors, significantly influence the performance of OPVs."

Three approaches for the deposition of ILs are demonstrated and evaluated; a thick SiOx sol–gel based on a one-step acidic catalysis applied by spray technique, a commercial screen-printable dielectric ink, and an epoxy-based material (SU8) deposited by screen printing or bar coating. These ILs demonstrated the properties of surface levelling (quantified by mechanical profilometry), electric insulation (tested using breakdown voltage and leakage current) and acted as an anti-diffusion barrier (demonstrated with glow discharge mass spectrometry). Moreover, the performances of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) thin film solar cells grown on carbon and stainless steels (a-Si:H: 5.53% and OPV: 2.40%) show similar performances as those obtained using a reference glass substrate (a-Si:H: 5.51% and OPV: 2.90%).

Emission spectra of the commonly used indoor light sources are much narrower with lower light intensity as compared to the standard solar spectrum. Highly tunability in optical absorption, insensitivity to series resistance and the active layer thickness, and mild operating conditions make indoor OPV cells promising as a practically relevant technology. Currently, the OPV module has obtained a power conversion efficiency of over 20%, with excellent stability under indoor conditions. However, at the present stage, the device physics investigations and material design strategies developed in an OPV cell for indoor applications lag behind outdoor applications. In particular, the emerging characterizations in photovoltaic measurements have severely affected the reliability of reports. This Spotlight on Applications highlights these opportunities and challenges of OPV cells for indoor applications, and review the recent progress in indoor OPV cells.

This is mainly shown for VDPV type 2. Here we describe a molecular-epidemiological investigation of a case of VDPV type 3 circulation leading to paralytic poliomyelitis in a child in an orphanage, where OPV has not been used. Samples of feces and blood serum from the patient and 52 contacts from the same orphanage were collected twice and investigated. The complete genome sequencing was performed for five polioviruses isolated from the patient and three contact children. The level of divergence of the genomes of the isolates corresponded to approximately 9–10 months of evolution. The presence of 61 common substitutions in all isolates indicated a common intermediate progenitor. The possibility of VDPV3 transmission from the excretor to susceptible recipients (unvaccinated against polio or vaccinated with inactivated poliovirus vaccine, IPV) with subsequent circulation in a closed children’s group was demonstrated. The study of the blood sera of orphanage residents at least twice vaccinated with IPV revealed the absence of neutralizing antibodies against at least two poliovirus serotypes in almost 20% of children. Therefore, a complete rejection of OPV vaccination can lead to a critical decrease in collective immunity level. The development of new poliovirus vaccines that create mucosal immunity for the adequate replacement of OPV from Sabin strains is necessary."

Experiments were performed in two similar greenhouse tunnels, covered by diffuse polyethylene sheet, during two summer growing seasons. In 2018, one tunnel was shaded using OPV modules (covering 37% of the roof area and resulting in 23% shading) and the second tunnel served as a control. In 2019, a 25% black shading screen was added to the control tunnel. The microclimate, yield, and physiological parameters were examined in the two tunnels. Results show that at noon (11:00 to 13:00), there was no significant difference in the mean seasonal (June–September 2018, May–August 2019) air temperature and humidity between the tunnels. In 2018, the tunnels differed in terms of the spatial radiation transmittance and leaf temperature. The average radiation level along the OPV tunnel centreline was much lower, and the radiation distribution was less homogeneous than in the control. In 2019, with similar shading percentages in the tunnels, similar average radiation levels were observed. The leaf temperature in the OPV was lower than in the control in 2018 and varied from higher to lower in 2019. The leaf area index (LAI), cumulative yield, and average fruit mass were higher in the OPV than in the control in 2018, and similar in 2019. The average value of the maximum power output of three OPV modules increased roughly linearly with irradiance."
89,89,10.1007/s10825-020-01510-9,,,Ternary inverter gate designs using OPV5-based single-molecule field-effect transistors,2020,"Over recent decades, much effort has been invested in the implementation of digital circuits using multivalued and fuzzy logic, as they are more similar to real-world arithmetic and logic. Ternary logic can be implemented in molecular electronics using transistors based on benzene rings because of their special characteristics. A dual-gate molecular field-effect transistor based on the oligo (phenylene vinylene) molecule, which consists of aromatic rings, is proposed herein. Moreover, models for the implementation of all the different types of ternary inverter, viz. a negative ternary inverter, standard ternary inverter, and positive ternary inverter, as well as a binary full adder (FA) cell are proposed. Of note, each of the ternary inverters is implemented using just one transistor, while the FA cell is implemented using two transistors. The transistor, the inverters, and the FA cell are simulated using standard tools to verify their functionality."

The proposed organic materials as an active material are PCPDTBT(Poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2ethyl-hexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4 b']dithiophene2,6diyl]]), P3HT (Poly(3-hexylthiophene 2,5-diyl)) and PC61BM ([6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) because of their non-linear optical properties, easy fabrication techniques and low cost. Transparent Conducting Oxides (TCOs) are used in photovoltaics and optical devices for its low electrical resistance. In addition, TCOs do not have many losses for propagated light. The metric for the comparative study between materials is the insertion losses for a 500 nm wavelength source along with these materials. The material that has better performance should have a low insertion loss. In this paper, a study was conducted on the behavior of acceptors concentration, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, I-V, and P-V characteristics on a 1D Si P-N junction. The numerical solutions for insertion losses and 1D Si P-N junction are carried out by LUMERICAL and COMSOL software, respectively. At a depth of 100 nm, PC61BM has a better performance over PCPDTBT and P3HT with Insertion losses (IL) of 3.07 dB and 2.76 dB for TE and TM mode, respectively. For TCOs materials. The behavior of insertion losses on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Gallium doped Zinc Oxide (GZO), and Aluminum doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) is traced. At a depth of 100 nm, the insertion losses are minimized by AZO and ITO with a magnitude of 1.91 dB and 1.87 dB for TE mode, respectively, while 1.45 dB for TM mode."
92,92,10.1016/j.joule.2020.05.010,,,High-Efficiency Indoor Organic Photovoltaics with a Band-Aligned Interlayer,2020,"Summary The emergence of indoor electronic devices for internet of things (IoT) has motivated the scientific community to develop photovoltaic devices that can efficiently convert indoor light into electricity. In this paper, we report high-efficiency non-fullerene organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with over 30% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under indoor conditions. Our results show that the choice of electron-transporting layer (ETL) is critically important to enable such performance. The use of an ETL (named PDI-NO) with a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level can effectively suppress leakage current and reduce trap-assisted recombination of the devices. Thus, using this ETL, we achieve record PCE of 31% by utilizing a low-band-gap acceptor in the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend. Whereas, in another case, by employing a large-band-gap acceptor, a PCE of 26.7% with over 1V is achieved. Our study paves the way toward high-performance indoor OPV devices for powering IoT electronics."
93,93,10.1039/d0cp01936d,,,Molecular-scale engineering of the charge-transfer excited states in non-covalently bound Zn-porphyrin and carbon fullerene based donor-acceptor complex,2020,"The low-lying charge-transfer (CT) excited-state plays an unprecedented role in promoting charge separation processes in organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials typically made of electron donor and acceptor building blocks. A Zn-porphyrin donor non-covalently bound to a fullerene derivative PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) acceptor displays low-lying CT excited states close to the donor absorbing state, and this unique donor-acceptor (D-A) complex is considered to be a potential candidate material for harvesting solar energy. Chemical tuning is expected to alter the CT energetics and their nature as well, which may affect the charge-separation efficiency. In this study, we computationally explore the possibility of tailoring the CT excited states of this novel composite by molecular-scale means via selective pyrrole ring hydrogenation of the Zn-porphyrin macrocycle donor using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT methods employing an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functional. Three representative donors are considered: Zn-porphyrin (no pyrrole ring hydrogenation), Zn-chlorin (one hydrogenated pyrrole ring) and Zn-bacteriochlorin (two hydrogenated diagonal pyrrole rings) that differ by the degree of pyrrole ring hydrogenation. Predictions are thoroughly compared to available theoretical and experimental data. Our results suggest that all three D-A complexes are energetically stable and show slightly increasing binding affinity with the extent of ring hydrogenation. This is ascribed to only a slight increase in the ground-state CT and significant van der Waals dispersion interactions. On the other hand, all three D-A complexes exhibit considerably tuned low-lying donor-localized π-π* absorbing and donor-to-acceptor CT states in their excited electronic states, which strongly affect the CT rates calculated in polar solvent. Among the three complexes studied, the one with the Zn-chlorin donor blended with the PCBM acceptor reveals energetics (such as driving force, reorganization energy and electronic coupling) strongly favouring the forward CT process with significantly reduced backward CT, and therefore, it turns out to be the best performer. This study sheds light on the fundamentals of molecular-scale engineering of excited-state properties in novel D-A complexes, which strongly affects the CT rates in polar solvent, and, thereby, opens up possible synthetic routes for tailoring and optimizing the performance level of OPV devices."

In order to demonstrate simpler and more scalable manufacturing processes, we printed the supercapacitors monolithically instead of laminating electrodes face-to-face and integrated the series connections into the fabrication process. The supercapacitor modules were printed onto the backside of the Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) modules to combine energy harvesting and storage module for harvesting light under normal indoor conditions, storing it in a supercapacitor module, and thus offering power for low power IoT devices."
95,95,10.35848/1347-4065/ab92ba,,,Simultaneous determination of electron and hole drift mobilities in working inverted organic solar cells: Modulated photocurrent spectroscopy versus impedance spectroscopy,2020,"Applicability of modulated photocurrent (MPC) spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy (IS) were examined both experimentally and numerically to simultaneous determination of electron and hole mobilities in working prototypical inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Charge carriers were photoinjected in MPC measurements and were injected from electrodes in IS. The P3HT:PCBM composition of the BHJ was chosen so as to observe both electron and hole transits separately. Electron and hole transits were simultaneously observed in the inverted OPVs by means of MPC measurements, while only hole transit was observed by means of IS. The device simulation shows that the reason that electron transit was not observed in the inverted OPVs by means of IS is due to the electron injection barrier of >0.2 eV inevitably existed in the inverted OPVs."
96,96,10.1016/j.synthmet.2020.116379,,,Boosting the short-circuit current density of organic photovoltaics using a composite electrode,2020,"Abstract Progress in organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiency is key to low-cost energy production. Device architectures comprising of the most effective materials, morphology, and well-designed layouts sit alongside the strategy which targets low-cost and high-performance devices. Here we report, an enhancement of the short-circuit current density, a key performance parameter, by using a silver/aluminum composite electrode in OPVs with a regular architecture. The use of the composite electrode in the inverted architecture results in a substantially reduced silver electrode thickness and thus offers material cost reductions. This work also highlights the importance of modeling the interference effects for optimizing the layer thicknesses along with systematic optimization of materials, morphology, and interfaces to further the enhancements in the field. For example, by simply reducing the thickness of the commonly used ZnO and MoO 3 interlayers in an inverted OPV it is possible to improve the short-circuit density. The optical field intensity distributions and optical power confinement within the active layer are exploited to reveal the origin of this enhancement."
97,97,10.1016/j.solener.2020.04.067,,,Power matrix of OPV mini-module under steady conditions of temperature and irradiance at large-area solar simulator,2020,"Abstract The knowledge of electrical current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) devices under various irradiance, temperature, and spectral conditions is essential for evaluating the output power and energy production of the devices under various climate conditions. The methods to measure the temperature and irradiance dependences of PV devices power are described in the standards IEC 60891 and IEC 61853-1. Newer PV technologies like organic (OPV) and dye-sensitized (DSSC) devices are rapidly evolving and considerable research effort has addressed alternative approaches to increase efficiency with promising values achieved in the last years. Measurements of the irradiance (G) and temperature (T) dependence of these emerging PV technologies are less established –when available– than those of Si-based devices. In this paper we present a first attempt of power-rating measurement for an OPV mini-module. The measurements were performed with a large-area steady-state solar simulator on a reduced (T,G) range compared to what the standard IEC 61853-1 requires. Nevertheless, they were sufficient to calculate the relative temperature coefficients alpha and beta, which have been satisfactorily compared to previous published values. Also, they provided a first data set for the irradiance dependence of OPV device performance. Finally, the power matrix built from these measurements represents at our knowledge the first data set available for energy rating of OPV technology, as the matrix was done for a single device and for both irradiance and temperature dependencies together."

The NP inks were stable for more than 4 days, and nanoparticle organic photovoltaic (NP-OPV) devices with efficiency (η) of 1% were fabricated. Detailed analysis of the morphology and performance of the precipitated NP-OPV devices indicated that an optimal blend is responsible for the photocurrent and efficiency observed. These results were confirmed by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis, which revealed that the precipitated NPs were resistant to thermal phase segregation, allowing thermal conditioning of the NP films. These results show that precipitated NPs provide a pathway to thermally stable NP-OPV devices with higher photocurrents and efficiencies, approaching those of optimal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV devices."

A reliable technology assessment and a correct evaluation of their potential when compared with currently available marketable PV technologies require performance measurements of the PV modules not only at standard test conditions (STC), but also at real operating conditions (IEC 61853–1).

102,102,10.1007/s10681-020-02620-y,,,Grain yield and stability of tropical maize hybrids developed from elite cultivars in contrasting environments under a rainforest agro-ecology,2020,"In the maize producing regions of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), compounding effects of genotype-by-environment interaction have necessitated breeding maize for outstanding performance and stability across varying environments. This study was conducted to assess the performance and stability of late-maturing cultivars and their respective hybrids evaluated under contrasting environments in the tropical rainforest region. We evaluated 108 genotypes in field trials under three different growing conditions in 2018 involving 14 open-pollinated parents and their hybrids derived from a diallel mating design. The genotypes were evaluated under field conditions using 9 × 12 alpha lattice design with three replications in six environments. The genotypes were divided into three groups, containing either the parents, hybrids or checks, for estimating the stability variance and grain yield. The difference between the lowest and highest yielding environment was 3.9 t ha −1 , while the repeatability of the grain yield trials ranged from 39 to 80%. The average grain yield of the hybrids (2.33 t ha −1 ) was significantly higher than that of the parents (2.19 t ha −1 ) and the check varieties (2.03 t ha −1 ). The hybrids were more stable than both the parents and the checks. They also showed a higher stability against a common group of the parents and checks. The results of this study suggest that high yielding and stable population hybrids can be utilized in breeding programmes aiming to provide improved varieties for the large number of rural maize farmers in the SSA zone, who often lack access or the capacity to purchase commercial hybrids."
104,104,10.1039/d0ta00818d,,,An energy and charge transfer synergetic donor-acceptor heterostructure 2D-COF in photovoltaics,2020,"The formation of orderly p–n heterojunctions by the wafer-scale alignment of donor (D) and acceptor (A) molecules, important to achieve high photocurrent generation in the organic semiconductor-based organization, remains a challenging topic. Presented herein is a distinctive D–A heterostructure two-dimensional organic covalent framework (2D-COF) as an efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) film, supported by the triple roles of the binary building blocks in a wafer-scale film growing at the water/oil interface, molecular level morphology control, and the synergistic Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and charge-transfer (CT) functions. The achieved D–A heterostructure 2D-COF has a wafer-scale size, efficient spectral response, and effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, resulting in an efficient photocurrent generation which is much larger than those of reported OPV COF materials. The achievement herein confirms that the marriage of FRET and a CT synergetic D–A heterostructure and an ultrathin 2D-COF film offer unparalleled advantages in OPV."
105,105,10.1039/d0cp01303j,,,Effects of non-halogenated solvent on the main properties of a solution-processed polymeric thin film for photovoltaic applications: A computational study,2020,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have reached high power conversion efficiencies, but they are usually processed using halogenated toxic solvents. Hence, before OPV devices can be mass-produced by industrial processing, it would be desirable to replace those solvents with eco-friendly ones. Theoretical tools may be then a powerful ally in the search for those new solvents. In order to better understand the mechanisms behind the interaction between solvent and polymer, classical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were used to produce a thin film of poly(4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl) (PTB7-Th), processed using two different solvents. PTB7-Th is widely applied as a donor material in OPVs. The first solvent is ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which is a highly toxic solvent widely used in lab-scale studies. The second solvent is ortho-methylanisole (o-MA), which is an eco-friendly solvent for organic photovoltaic (OPV) manufacturing. Here we use a solvent evaporation protocol to simulate the formation of the PTB7-Th film. We demonstrate that our theoretical MD calculations were able to capture some differences in the macroscopic properties of thin films formed by o-DCB or o-MA evaporation. We found that the interaction of the halogenated solvent with the polymer tends to break the bonds between the lateral thiophenediyl groups and the main chain. We show that those defects may create traps that can affect the charge transport and also can be responsible for a blue shift in the absorption spectrum. Using the Monte Carlo method, we also verified the influence of the resulting MD morphology on the mobility of holes. Our theoretical results showed good agreement with the experimental measurements and both demonstrate that o-MA can be used to make polymer thin films without any loss of key properties for the device performance. The findings here highlight the importance of theoretical results as a guide to the morphological optimization of green processed polymeric films."
106,106,10.1039/d0dt00637h,,,Carbazole-based green and blue-BODIPY dyads and triads as donors for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells,2020,"Two BODIPY derivatives with one (B2) and two (B3) carbazole moieties were synthesized and applied as electron-donor materials in organic photovoltaic cells (OPV). Their optical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated. These BODIPY dyes exhibit excellent solubility in organic solvents and present high molar extinction coefficients (1.37-1.48 × 105 M-1 cm-1) in solutions with absorption maxima at 586 nm for mono-styryl groups and at 672 nm for di-styryl groups. The introduction of the styryl moieties results in a large bathochromic shift and a significant decrease in the HOMO-LUMO energy-gaps. The BODIPY dyes show relatively low HOMO energies ranging from -4.99 to -5.16 eV as determined from cyclic voltammetry measurements. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the frontier molecular orbital levels of these compounds match with those of PC71BM as the acceptor, supporting their application as donor materials in solution-processed small molecule bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. After the optimization of the active layer, B2:PC71BM and B3:PC71BM based organic solar cells showed an overall power conversion efficiency of 6.41% and 7.47%, respectively. The higher PCE of the B3-based OSC is ascribed to the more balanced charge transport and exciton dissociation, better crystallinity and molecular packing."
107,107,10.1515/pac-2018-1230,,,Temporal probing of excitons in organic semiconductors,2020,"Abstract Photoinduced charge generation forms the physical basis for energy conversion in organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology. The fundamental initial steps involved are absorption of light by organic semiconductors (generally π-conjugated polymers) to generate photoexcited states (Frenkel excitons) followed by charge transfer and charge separation processes in presence of suitable acceptor. The absorbed photon energy must be utilized completely for achieving maximum device efficiency. However progressive relaxation losses of instantaneously generated high-energy or hot-excited states form major bottleneck for maximum derivable voltage. This efficiency limiting factor has been challenged recently by the role of hot-carriers in efficient generation of charges. Therefore tailoring the dissociation of hot-exciton to be temporally faster than all relaxation processes could minimize the energy loss pathways. Implementation of this concept of hot-carrier photovoltaics demands critical understanding of molecular parameters that circumvent all energy relaxation processes and favor hot-carrier generation. In my dissertation work, I have examined the fate of photo-generated excitons in the context of polymer backbone and morphology, and therefore obtain a fundamental structure-function correlation in organic semiconductors."

Among numerous derivatives of this polyaromatic hydrocarbon, perylene diimide (PDI) represents a promising class of organic materials envisioned as non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for the practical organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications due to their enhanced photo- and thermal stability and remarkably high electron affinity, some of which realize band-like transport properties.

110,110,10.3390/molecules25102441,,,Effects of intra- And interchain interactions on exciton dynamics of PTB7 revealed by model oligomers,2020,"Recent studies have shown that molecular aggregation structures in precursor solutions of organic photovoltaic (OPV) polymers have substantial influence on polymer film morphology, exciton and charge carrier transport dynamics, and hence, the resultant device performance. To distinguish photophysical impacts due to increasing π-conjugation from chain lengthening and π–π stacking from single/multi chain aggregation in solution and film, we used oligomers of a well-studied charge transfer polymer PTB7 with different lengths as models to reveal intrinsic photophysical properties of a conjugated segment in the absence of inter-segment aggregation. In comparison with previously studied photophysical properties in polymeric PTB7, we found that oligomer dynamics are dominated by a process of planarization of the conjugated backbone into a quinoidal structure that resembles the self-folded polymer and that, when its emission is isolated, this quinoidal excited state resembling the planar polymer chain exhibits substantial charge transfer character via solvent-dependent emission shifts. Furthermore, the oligomers distinctly lack the long-lived charge separated species characteristic of PTB7, suggesting that the progression from charge transfer character in isolated chains to exciton splitting in neat polymer solution is modulated by the interchain interactions enabled by self-folding."
111,111,10.1002/adma.201908205,,,Single-Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cells with Approaching 18% Efficiency,2020,"Optimizing the molecular structures of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials is one of the most effective methods to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). For an excellent molecular system with a certain conjugated skeleton, fine tuning the alky chains is of considerable significance to fully explore its photovoltaic potential. In this work, the optimization of alkyl chains is performed on a chlorinated nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) named BTP-4Cl-BO (a Y6 derivative) and very impressive photovoltaic parameters in OPV cells are obtained. To get more ordered intermolecular packing, the n-undecyl is shortened at the edge of BTP-eC11 to n-nonyl and n-heptyl. As a result, the NFAs of BTP-eC9 and BTP-eC7 are synthesized. The BTP-eC7 shows relatively poor solubility and thus limits its application in device fabrication. Fortunately, the BTP-eC9 possesses good solubility and, at the same time, enhanced electron transport property than BTP-eC11. Significantly, due to the simultaneously enhanced short-circuit current density and fill factor, the BTP-eC9-based single-junction OPV cells record a maximum PCE of 17.8% and get a certified value of 17.3%. These results demonstrate that minimizing the alkyl chains to get suitable solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing has a great potential in further improving its photovoltaic performance."

Here, we investigated a donor layer composed of a liquid crystalline cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) – P3HT. The CoPc presents a complementary absorption spectrum in the near infrared region and compact anisotropic molecular arrangement to promote efficient charge migration. The energy levels of CoPc are properly located between the corresponding levels of P3HT and PCBM, forming an energy cascade alignment. The P3HT/CoPc blend showed improved photophysical and electrical response depending on the CoPc concentration and thermal annealing. We demonstrated that molecular order, morphology and energetic barrier at cluster interfaces are competing effects and need to be taken into account to optimize charge transport."
113,113,10.1016/j.tsf.2020.137921,,,Utilization of poly (4-styrenesulfonic acid) doped polyaniline as a hole transport layer of organic solar cell for indoor applications,2020,"Abstract The demand for low dimensional, micro powered and wireless indoor electronic devices has been increasing. To power-up those devices, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are being employed. The OPV cells exhibit good spectral matching and mechanical flexibility, and can harvest artificial indoor light energy efficiently. Hole transport layer (HTL) is an important component of an OPV cell. Water stable, low temperature processable poly (3, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly (4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) based HTL is commonly used in the indoor OPV cells. However, strongly acidic, highly hydrophilic and expensive PEDOT:PSS resulted in the development of cheaper, mildly acidic and less humidity sensitive alternative hole transport material (HTM) for the indoor OPV cells. Here, we utilized an economical and low acidic, water-stable PSS doped polyaniline (PANI) as HTM for a poly (3-hexylthiophene): [6, 6]-indene-C60 bisadduct (P3HT:ICBA) active material-based indoor OPV cell. The film formed by chemically synthesized PANI:PSS exhibited over 90% transmittance and approximately 5.15 eV work function value. The OPV device exhibited higher shunt resistance and greater power conversion efficiency (PCE) during the operation in an indoor environment. For 1000 Lux white LED light, the device showed around 10% PCE. Furthermore, the device exhibited better stability than PEDOT:PSS HTL based indoor OPV."

117,117,10.1039/c9se00811j,,,Thermal degradation related to the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and back electrode of the flexible inverted organic photovoltaic module,2020,"The hole transport layer (HTL) and back electrode play a significant role in the stability of the flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) module. In particular, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), a widely used hole transport material, is known to be associated with many degrading factors in the OPV field. This study highlights the impact of the PEDOT:PSS layer on thermal stability using a thermal acceleration test of flexible OPV modules with the inverted structure of indium tin oxide/ZnO/photoactive layer/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. The results confirm that thermal degradation of the OPV devices depends on heat temperature, in which the OPV performance degrades by a notable decrease in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) as the temperature increases from 65 °C to 85 °C. Moreover, the stability of Voc is enhanced when the PEDOT:PSS layer is thicker and contains polar solvent DMSO as an additive, suggesting that the thermal degradation can correlate with the properties of the PEDOT:PSS layer. In addition, microscopy images of the active layers show that the surface damage is attributed to a residual solvent of the printed Ag electrode, thereby resulting in a thermally induced drop in the short circuit current density (Jsc). More detailed descriptions are presented in this paper, and the results are expected to offer a comprehensive understanding of the thermal degradation mechanism of OPV modules."

Integrating an energy harvesting and storage device into photovoltaic energy storage modules is a viable route for obtaining self-powered energy systems. Herein, an MXene-based all-solution processed semitransparent flexible photovoltaic supercapacitor (PSC) was fabricated by integrating a flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) with Ti3C2Tx MXene as the electrode and transparent MXene supercapacitors with an organic ionogel as the electrolyte in the vertical direction, using Ti3C2Tx thin film as a common electrode. In the quest for a semitransparent flexible PSC, Ti3C2Tx MXene was first used as a transparent electrode for OPV with a high power conversion efficiency of 13.6%. The ionogel electrolyte-based transparent MXene supercapacitor shows a high volumetric capacitance of 502 F cm−3 and excellent stability. Finally, a flexible PSC with a high average transmittance of over 33.5% was successfully constructed by all-solution processing and a remarkable storage efficiency of 88% was achieved. This strategy enables a simple route for fabricating MXene based high-performance all-solution-processed flexible PSCs, which is important for realizing flexible and printable electronics for future technologies."

The conventional neutralization test is based on inhibition of cytopathic effect caused by poliovirus by serial dilutions of test serum. It is laborious, time-consuming and not suitable for large scale analysis. To overcome these limitations, a multiplex PCR-based neutralization (MPBN) assay was developed to measure the neutralizing antibody titers of anti-poliovirus sera against three serotypes of the virus in the same reaction and in shorter time. All three anti-poliovirus sera types were analyzed in a single assay. The MPBN assay was reproducible, robust and sensitive. Its lower limits of titration for the three anti-poliovirus sera types were within range of 0.76–1.64 per mL. Different anti-poliovirus sera were tested with conventional and MPBN assays; the results obtained by both methods correlated well and generated similar results. The MPBN is the first neutralization assay that specifically titrates anti-poliovirus antibodies against the three serotypes of the virus in the same reaction; it can be completed in two to three days instead of ten days for the conventional assay and can be automated for high-throughput implementation."

Herein, we investigated the LPE in an bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV:PCBM/Al structure. The LPE exhibits a linear dependence on the laser spot position, with position sensitivity of 2.97 mV/mm (ITO) and 0.53 mV/mm (Al) at 300K. The transverse I–V curves in the dark and under AM1.5 illumination show the typical rectifying characteristic and the photovoltaic properties of OPV cells. With the increase of temperature, the lateral photovoltage increases accordingly. The mechanism of LPE in OPV devices was also discussed. It can be a kind of promising position-sensitive detectors for organic electronic applications."

The Ni-PDI, Pd-PDI, and Pt-PDI propellers, equipped with d8 metal cores, have two absorption bands at 350–650 nm and 780–1200 nm with deep LUMO levels of −4.40 eV to −4.51 eV. The TTF-PDI, QU-PDI, and PH-PDI propellers with non-metal cores have only one absorption band at 350–650 nm with upshifted LUMO levels. Interestingly, the organic photovoltaic (OPV) results show that reducing the intramolecular charge traps between the blade and core subunits of the PDI propellers can effectively improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The device based on the QU-PDI acceptor exhibits a PCE that is up to more than 300 times higher (9.33%) than that of the d8 metal core PDI propellers (Pd-PDI, PCE = 0.03%), which is one of the best photovoltaic performances with an excellent fill factor (FF = 71.8%) exhibited by PDI-derivative acceptors. Conversely, the electro-catalytic H2 evolution activity of Pt-PDI (current destiny = 10.00 mA cm−2 at −0.377 V), which exhibited a record performance for PDI-based catalysts to date, is up to 1000 times greater than that of the non-metal core PDI propellers (QU-PDI, 0.01 mA cm−2 at −0.377 V). Our results indicate that both highly efficient OPV and electrochemical H2 evolution catalysts can be achieved via the rational functionalization of PDI propellers with non-metal and d8 metal cores."

Crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) with a crystallizable core-forming oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) segment can be a powerful strategy for the preparation of uniform fiber-like nanostructures containing a π-conjugated core with controlled dimension and composition. However, the self-assembly landscape can be complex, and our understanding of the nucleation and growth processes in the CDSA of BCPs with a crystalline π-conjugated segment is limited.


EXPERIMENTS
We used fluorescence spectroscopy and 1H NMR to follow the self-assembly of oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)-b-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (OPV5-b-PNIPAM49), a typical π-conjugated-coil BCP, as solution of the BCP in ethanol is cooled from 80 °C to 23 °C and allowed to age, µDSC to monitor the crystallization exotherm, and DLS and TEM to follow micelle growth. We see a striking difference in the experiments that monitor unimer in solution comparing to those that monitor micelle growth. We see nearly complete disappearance of unimer within 30 min upon cooling. In contrast, the micelles continue to grow, increasing in length by a factor of ten over the next several hours. We are able to exclude growth by end-to-end coupling.


FINDINGS
We propose a self-assembly mechanism in which short semi-crystalline rod-like micelles form upon cooling, accompanied by small amorphous aggregates. Unimers that dissociate from these aggregates subsequently deposit on the growing ends of the core-crystalline micelles. We also find that the length of the PNIPAM block affects the elongation kinetics of OPV5-b-PNIPAM."

In Thailand, the hepatitis B (HB) vaccine is administered as a tetravalent vaccine (DTwP-HB) to all infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, following an initial vaccination with a monovalent HB vaccine at birth. As part of ongoing vaccine evaluation, we aimed to compare the hepatitis B immunogenicity profiles of children who had received either the pentavalent (DTwP-HB-Hib) or the hexavalent (DTaP-HB-Hib-IPV) vaccine.


METHODS
Two groups of infants, whose mothers previously received the tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), were randomly vaccinated with either pentavalent or hexavalent vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age, following monovalent HB vaccine at birth. Blood samples were obtained at birth, one-month post-primary series immunization (mo 7), pre-booster (mo 18), one-month post-booster (mo 19), and six months post-booster (mo 24). The third group of infants, whose mothers did not receive Tdap, was vaccinated with DTwP-HB-Hib (EPI pentavalent group). Levels of HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs were evaluated by means of an automated Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay.


RESULTS
Anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/ml were achieved in 99.2% (hexavalent group), 99.2% (pentavalent group), and 98.5% (EPI pentavalent group) of infants, after four-dose immunization (at 0, 2, 4, 6 months of age). One month after the additional dose given at 18 months of age, anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/ml were observed in 100% (hexavalent group), 99.2% (pentavalent group), and 93.8% (EPI pentavalent group) of infants. At 24 months of age, higher percentages of infants achieving anti-HBs levels ≥10 mIU/ml were found in the hexavalent group (98.3%) compared to the pentavalent group (86.5%).


CONCLUSIONS
Both vaccines were effective in inducing anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/ml, and therefore either can be used as a single formula booster at 18 months of age to simplify vaccine administration under the Expanded Program on Immunization in Thailand."
125,125,10.1021/jacs.9b12526,,,Reduced Recombination and Capacitor-like Charge Buildup in an Organic Heterojunction,2020,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiencies continue to rise, raising their prospects for solar energy conversion. However, researchers have long considered how to suppress the loss of free carriers by recombination-poor diffusion and significant Coulombic attraction can cause electrons and holes to encounter each other at interfaces close to where they were photogenerated. Using femtosecond transient spectroscopies, we report the nanosecond grow-in of a large transient 20 Stark effect, caused by nanoscale electric fields of ~487 kV/cm between photogenerated free carriers in the device active layer. We find that particular morphologies of the active layer lead to an energetic cascade for charge carriers, suppressing pathways to recombination, which is ~2000 times less than predicted by Langevin theory. This in turn leads to the build-up of electric charge in donor and acceptor domains-away from the interface-resistant to bimolecular recombination. 25 Interestingly, this signal is only experimentally obvious in thick films, due to the different scaling of electro-absorption and photo-induced absorption signals in transient absorption spectroscopy. Rather than inhibiting device performance, we show that devices up to 600 nm thick maintain efficiencies of > 8 % because domains can afford much higher carrier densities. These observations suggest that with particular nanoscale morphologies, the bulk heterojunction can go beyond its established role in charge photogeneration, and can act as a capacitor, where adjacent free charges are held away from the interface and can be protected from bimolecular recombination."
126,126,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100641,,,Outdoor behaviour of organic photovoltaics on a greenhouse roof,2020,"Abstract This study presents a detailed analysis of the outdoor behaviour of organic photovoltaic (OPV) panels on a polytunnel type greenhouse roof in a Mediterranean climate, looking at the effects of environmental variables and panel orientations on the electrical behaviour and degradation of the panels, thus providing crucial outdoor testing results of greenhouse integrated OPVs in this climatic region. The OPV panel placed at the polytunnel ridge of the roof yielded highest outputs, efficiencies and fill factors during the measurement period. However, the use of panels on the East and West sides of the greenhouse roof, could reduce midday output peaks and therefore provide a more balanced power supply throughout the day. The diurnal variation in OPV behaviour was influenced by simultaneous effects of changing irradiance and temperature. It was found that although output was higher, the OPVs showed dips in fill factor and efficiency at times with high incident irradiance. This was assumed to be due to a reversible degradation phenomenon under high direct irradiance conditions, which led to higher performance during morning hours compared to the afternoon and was followed by a recovery overnight and to some extent in shaded conditions."

Blends made of the small molecule donor 2,2′-[(3,3′″,3″″,4′-tetraoctyl[2,2′:5′,2″:5″,2′″:5′″,2″″-quinquethiophene]-5,5″″-diyl)bis[(Z)-methylidyne(3-ethyl-4-oxo-5,2-thiazolidinediylidene)]]bis-propanedinitrile (DRCN5T) and the acceptor [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were annealed using solvent vapors with either a high solubility for the donor (tetrahydrofuran), the acceptor (carbon disulfide) or both (chloroform). The samples were analyzed by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), electron diffraction, X-ray pole figures, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). A phase separation of DRCN5T and PC71BM is induced by SVA leading to a crystallization of DRCN5T and the formation of a DRCN5T enriched layer. The DRCN5T crystallites possess the two dimensional oblique crystal system with the lattice parameters a = 19.2 Å, c = 27.1 Å, and β = 111.1° for the chloroform case. No major differences in the crystal structure for the other solvent vapors were observed. However, the solvent choice strongly influences the size of the DRCN5T enriched layer. Missing periodicity in the [010]-direction leads to the extinction of all Bragg reflections with k ≠ 0. The annealed samples are randomly orientated with respect to the normal of the substrate (fiber texture)."

The ESD PEDOT:PSS films exhibited higher PSS content on the surface than spin-coated PEDOT:PSS films, which results in a higher work function. Based on this result, metal-electrode-free inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) were fabricated. The ESD PEDOT:PSS was used as the top electrode on the poly(3-hexythiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) light-absorbing layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs was significantly increased with the 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile layer. The improved PCE would be attributed to the suppression of exciton quenching at the P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS interface."

Organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) made of organic pigments are typically with thickness of a few or a few tens of nanometers. Thickness of organic photovoltaic cells made with polymers exceeds them typically up to the order of a few 100 nm but still necessarily co-optimized with respect to light absorption and charge transport. Here, we demonstrate that crystallization made a 10-μm-thick pigment layer active in a photovoltaic cell, using a prototypical pair of pigments, phthalocyanine, and fullerene. It is proved that crystalline pigment layer with a thickness much greater than what is needed for optical optimization can be utilized for organic optoelectronic devices and that organic optoelectronic devices have potentiality to relief their design from co-optimization of optics and charge transport."

All polymers readily dissolve in chlorine-free solvents such as xylene, and the corresponding photoactive blend films can be processed in ambient from this solvent to fabricate cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >12%–14%. Furthermore, the blend processing and OPV metrics are remarkably insensitive to the processing methodology (spin coating versus blade coating), processing solvent, polymer molecular mass and dispersity index, and the results were rationalized by UV-vis, PL, fsTA, AFM, TEM, GIWAXS, and SCLC measurements. These properties enable the first OPV modules, processed in ambient from a benign solvent, with a certified PCE of 10.1% for an area of 20.4 cm2 and >7% after light soaking. The same module also delivers a power of ∼40 μW/cm2 (PCE ∼22%) under indoor lighting."

Optical optimization of the OPV cell is first performed to determine the optimal geometry of the stack. The studied device structure is: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al. Simulation results give as optimized thicknesses: dPEDOT:PSS = 27 nm and dActive layer = 91 nm. The optimized OVP cell gives a short-circuit current JSC = 12.48 mA/cm2. The influence of technological parameters on the performance of the optimized P3HT:PCBM blend OPV cell is then clearly defined. Simulation results show that among the mass ratio of P3HT:PCBM blend active layers studied (1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 2:3 and 3:2), the active layer with the higher blend mass ratio (2:1) gives the best optical properties. Also, increasing the annealing temperature of the active layer leads to increase absorption. The blend active layer annealed at 140°C presents the best optical properties of the OPV cell."

This work involves the examination of flexible, semi-transparent, organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules in an outdoor testing environment to study degradation in the hot, arid, Tucson, AZ climate. The work reports on changes in the I-V performance and efficiency of a string of two OPV modules in order to estimate degradation experienced by the OPV modules.

Almost all children infected with polio developed paralytic poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis, an acute paralytic disease is caused through 3 poliovirus serotypes, type 1, 2, and 3. 25,000 to 50,000 new cases occurred in each year. To combat this menace an American Physician, Jonas Salk developed the first-ever polio vaccine known as the Inactivated Polio Vaccine or Salk Vaccine in the early 1950s. The vaccine was a killed vaccine and given by injection. An oral live attenuated poliovirus vaccine was introduced by another American Physician Albert Sabin in the early 1960s. Both these vaccines contain all three variations of poliovirus strains. Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) has been the cornerstone of eradication efforts in endemic countries, using it as the vaccine of choice in mass immunization programmes. It provides superior mucosal immunity against subsequent infection and spreads vaccine to closer contacts, thereby immunizing the children who could not be reached by immunization programmes.OPV has multiple licensed formulations, i) Monovalent OPVs against type 1(mOPV1), type 2(mOPV2) or type 3(mOPV3) ii) Bivalent OPV (bOPV) containing type 1 and 3, and iii) Trivalent OPV containing type 1,2, and 3 (tOPV)2. It was reported that tOPV is associated with rare cases of VAPP (Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis). According to a recent review, the global risk is estimated to be around 4.7 per million births (range 2.49.7)3 and approximately 2-4 cases per 1 million in a birth cohort in developing countries4. Another major adverse event associated with OPV is cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus) which arises due to mutation and recombination with other enteroviruses in the human gut and are usually 1-15% divergent from the parent vaccine virus5."

This is not a wonder to say that it has been successfully stored the information of approximately 3 trillion cells of the human body in only 1 megabyte (MB) space. Due to this magnificent era of technology, many diseases could be controlled with the help of Knowledge Graphs, Motif Detection, Artificial Intelligence Medicines (AIM), and Data Visual Analytics (DVA). Many may say, and we agree, when the optimize cure of old diseases like cancer, aids and poliomyelitis would be control in a well-disciplined manner. According to WHO, these aforementioned diseases are under observation in each and every medical field in order to get rid of its demerits. Around the world, Pakistan; the disease of polio infection is extremely high. Polio is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease. Poliovirus; is the major cause of polio, spread person to person and particularly its attack directly on the brain and spinal cord. These symptoms further leads to permanent paralysis. Pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems such as those have HIV-positive and young children are the most susceptible to the poliovirus. Different types of symptoms of the detection of polio virus-like fever, sore throat, headache, vomiting, fatigue, meningitis are investigated. Polio symptoms, generally appear between 3 and 21 days after infection. The detection of the polio virus in the early stages is not an easy task. For this, we have proposed a technique to detect the polio virus on the early stage of infection. The detection of polio and its motifs in the human body is easily found out with the help of our proposed technique. This technique based on motif detection in which we can identify the occurrence of harmful microcells in the patient body. For this, it needs to control the poliovirus in the early stages and help to take a proper action or Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) and also decrease the rate of polio to make polio-free Pakistan."

These parameters have been combined to establish a figure of merit, Ω, which determines the suitability of OPV materials for real-world large-scale implementation. As a case study, small scale device efficiency optimization, lifetime measurements and cost analysis of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4, P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM systems was undertaken. The figure of merit developed through these case studies is also shown to be suitable for broader assessment of all materials incorporated into manufacturing of OPV technology. Despite the relatively large differences in optimized small scale device efficiency P3HT:PCBM was, with an Ω value of $8.3 per m2 per %, calculated as the most cost effective material system tested herein. This work demonstrates that small scale device efficiency alone is not a good proxy for the suitability of OPV material systems for large scale manufacturing and that the cost effectiveness figure of merit provides the more nuanced approach that is required."

For the past decade the potential for organic electronic materials to revolutionize this printed electronics space has been widely promoted. Such conviction in the potential of these carbon-based semiconducting materials arises from their ability to be dissolved in solution, and thus the exciting possibility of simply printing a range of multifunctional devices onto flexible substrates at high speeds for very low cost using standard roll-to-roll printing techniques. However, the transition from promising laboratory innovations to large scale prototypes requires precise control of nanoscale material and device structure across large areas during printing fabrication. Maintaining this nanoscale material control during printing presents a significant new challenge that demands the coupling of organic electronic materials and devices with clever nanoscience fabrication approaches that are adapted to the limited thermodynamic levers available. In this review we present an update on the strategies and capabilities that are required in order to manipulate the nanoscale structure of large area printed organic photovoltaic, transistor and bioelectronics devices in order to control their device functionality. This discussion covers a range of efforts to manipulate the electroactive ink materials and their nanostructured assembly into devices, and also device processing strategies to tune the nanoscale material properties and assembly routes through printing fabrication. The review finishes by highlighting progress in printed organic electronic devices that provide a feedback loop between laboratory nanoscience innovations and their feasibility in adapting to large scale printing fabrication. The ability to control material properties on the nanoscale whilst simultaneously printing functional devices on the square metre scale is prompting innovative developments in the targeted nanoscience required for organic photovoltaic, transistor and biofunctional devices."
140,140,10.1016/j.mser.2019.100519,,,Nonlinear optoelectronic processes in organic optoelectronic devices: Triplet-triplet annihilation and singlet fission,2020,"Abstract Organic semiconductors with optoelectronic properties have attracted intensive interests in the fields of organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and organic photodetectors. In these functional devices, exciton evolution is the key process. Generally, linear process is dominant that one photon is created from each injected electron-hole pair, vice versa. This linear process restricts the internal quantum efficiency to be 100% in optoelectronic devices. Alternatively, nonlinear optoelectronic processes, like triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) and singlet fission (SF), can theoretically break the limitation stated in linear optoelectronic processes. TTA and SF are two dynamic reversible processes, which link one high-lying energy singlet with two low-lying energy triplet excitons on two neighboring chromophores. These nonlinear processes bring the possibility of novel functions and application scenarios, and hence have attracted more and more attentions recently. This review will systematically and comparatively summarize the basic properties of TTA and SF processes, and their applications in optoelectronic devices in the view of device physics. It starts with a concise introduction of basic knowledge of TTA and SF. Then, the characteristics used to identify these processes are described. Subsequently, implementing them in OLEDs are summarized, followed by the application examples in OPVs. Emphasis is laid on the triplet quenching mechanisms in working devices, since both TTA and SF processes highly rely on triplet excitons. These discussions on the recent important progresses aim to gain some insight into the device physics for device engineering. Finally, a perspective is presented."
141,141,10.1016/j.orgel.2019.105448,,,Factors contributing to degradation of organic photovoltaic cells,2020,"Abstract The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells has considerably improved over the past decade, and now exceeds an energy conversion efficiency of 10%, the benchmark for practical use. One factor contributing to this increase is the development of π-conjugated linear acceptor molecules as alternatives to fullerene derivatives. Although conversion efficiency is an important issue for practical applications, device stability is also necessary for commercialization of OPV technologies. To date, long-term stability has been examined in OPV devices based on fullerenes. However, the factors involved in performance degradation remain poorly understood. It is difficult to address this problem because of the multilayer nature of the devices and many factors involved in degradation. In recent OPV devices based on π-conjugated molecules as acceptors, there have been few reports on stability under continuous light irradiation. Ensuring the stability of the π-conjugated molecules under illumination and electrical operation is critical for achieving practical use of OPV devices. In this paper, we comprehensively analyzed OPV devices based on EH-IDTBR as an acceptor material. We identified a decrease in OPV performance of approximately 50% under 100-h light irradiation, which we attribute to increased resistance of the organic semiconductor layer. The increase in resistance was caused by a decrease in the number of carriers, suggesting that structural changes in the EH-IDTBR molecule are an important factor affecting degradation."

Pemphigus vulgaris patients with exclusive oral involvement (OPV) treated with conventional immunosuppressive therapy may be non-responders or experience severe side effects and/or relapses. In such cases, Rituximab could be used as adjuvant in recalcitrant OPV patients METHODS: A retrospective single-centre study on patients with oral pemphigus vulgaris treated with RTX at the dosage of 375mg/m2 was performed, evaluating the complete clinical and immunological remission, side effects of RTX, and possible correlation between anti-Desmoglein (Dsg) 3 antibodies and clinical remission.


RESULTS
We treated 10 OPV patients, of which 60% had a moderate and 40% mild disease severity before therapy with RTX. Complete clinical remission (CCR) was achieved in 100% of OPV patients, of which 20% developed side effects and 20% experienced a relapse in a mean time of 15.2 ± 10.2 weeks. The mean time for CCR was achieved in 19.8 ± 10.3 weeks, whereas the duration of the CCR consisted in 37.4 ± 33.5 weeks. OPV patients underwent a mean follow-up of 57.2 ± 37.7 weeks. In all patients, the mean of pemphigus disease area index (PDAI) decreased from 20.3 ± 14.1 to 0.4 ± 0.0, whereas the mean Dsg 3 value dropped from 157.1 ± 40.6 to 67.0 ± 26.6 after therapy with RTX. However, no correlation was found between PDAI and anti-Dsg 3 antibodies before and after therapy with RTX (p > 0.05).

RTX represents a valid and safe alternative as adjuvant in OPV patients with low rate of relapses and side effects. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Methods: Post-vaccination campaign evaluation was conducted after completion of the 2nd dose of oral cholera vaccine (OCV2) and oral polio vaccine (OPV2) through a cross-sectional survey. The evaluation was conducted in the Balukhali camps under Ukhiya upazilla. Precision-based sample size was calculated to estimate the vaccine coverage. Ninety-two trained interviewers were involved to collect data from the target of approximately 40000 FDMNs between 18 and 25 November 2017. Results: Data were collected from 39,438 FDMNs during the survey period. The highest coverage was observed for OCVs (94% for OCV1 and 92% for OCV2). On the other hand, lower coverage was observed for the other vaccines; the coverage for OPV1, OPV2 and MR were 75%, 88% and 38%, respectively. Unawareness (30.7% did not know about the campaign) was the most notable cause of lowering down MR vaccine coverage. Conclusion: The experience in Bangladesh demonstrates that vaccine campaigns can be successfully implemented as part of a comprehensive response toward disease outbreak among high-risk populations in humanitarian crisis."

This progress places organic solar cells at the forefront of thin-film photovoltaic technology. However, in order to meet industrial demands and reach high performance values in industrial settings, further research and development efforts within Roll-to-Roll (R2R) and Sheet-to-Sheet (S2S) processing of OPV devices under ambient conditions are required. Furthermore, OPV modules being manufactured through such up-scaled processing techniques should ideally be developed from low cost materials, and show good stability towards various different operational stress conditions. In this work, we demonstrate combined R2R and S2S development of ITO-free OPV devices, which are based on the non-fullerene material system PBDB-T:ITIC. The devices are processed from R2R vacuum sputtering and S2S slot-die coating at ambient conditions, and reach cell PCE values of 5.5%. In addition, we introduce a correlation between different barrier films, both commercial and sputtered inorganic coatings on ultra-clean PET, and the lifetime of the developed devices. The results therefore demonstrate an important step in the development of OPV devices from R2R and S2S processes in industrial settings."

Due to the economical and ecological advantages, organic solar cells are evolved. This paper presents the affect on power conversion efficiency (PCE) by adding an active layer in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cell along-with one thin intermediate layer. Firstly, the efficiency is demonstrated by single layer BHJ with P3HT:PCBM material as an active layer. Furthermore, one additional active layer of MEH-PPV:PCBM material is added in BHJ with former material, an intermediate layer of organic material hexdecafluoro copper phthalocyanine (F16CuPc) is also introduced and the affect on efficiency is studied using Silvaco Atlas TCAD. Also, aluminium-doped-zinc-oxide (AZO) material which is a transparent-conducting-oxide (TCO) is used as anode layer. The Power-Conversion-Efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell depends on short-circuit-current-density (Jsc), open-circuit-voltage (Voc) and fill_factor (FF). The increment of the short circuit current is observed in multilayer in comparison to BHJ. Therefore, PCE is increased from 7.4% to 10.3%. Hence, the addition of active layer in BHJ increases the PCE of organic solar cell or photovoltaic cell (OPV)."

The performance of OPV module is strongly changed by the interfacial materials, thin film deposition methods, and processing atmosphere with the film-forming properties of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer influenced intimately to the efficiency of the devices. Herein, we present a reliable process flow and module architecture to demonstrate an air-stable, large-area, and solution-processable OPV module, which the electron transporting layer (ETL), BHJ layer, and hole transporting layer (HTL) are all deposited by slot-die coating and processed in the ambient. Thus prepared module achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.56% with an active area of 23.7 cm2 and FF up to 65% under 100 mW/cm2 AM1.5G irradiation. The cell to module loss is found to be 5.5% only in PCE. The encapsulated module also performed superior stability, the performance remained almost unchanged, and PCE can still maintain about 91.7% of the initial value after 1000 h light soaking. We believe this module performed an extremely high PCE reported for OPV module fabricated by ambient slot-die coating in single junction architecture, inferring that the industrialization of OPVs is promising and expectable."
150,150,10.1007/s00723-019-01149-1,,,Charge Transfer State in the Composite DTS(FBTTh<inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>:PC<inf>71</inf>BM: Dynamics of Electron–Hole Distance Distribution After Light Absorption,2019,Light-induced charge separation in an organic photovoltaic (OPV) composite DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM was studied. DTS(FBTTh2)2 or DTS is a non-polymer electron donor and PC71BM is a fullerene-based electron acceptor. Electron spin echo (ESE) technique has been developed to separate the signal of interfacial charge transfer state (CTS) from that of trapped charges. Pronounced out-of-phase ESE signal was observed within first few microseconds after a laser flash exciting the composite at cryogenic temperatures. This implies correlation of unpaired electron spins of DTS+ and PC71BM– species constituting CTS. The distribution of distances between these species is derived from out-of-phase ESE envelope modulation (ESEEM). Out-of-phase ESEEM traces were numerically simulated by the model assuming both magnetic dipolar and electron–hole exchange interactions within CTS. The most probable distance between DTS+ and PC71BM– within CTS increases from 4.9 nm and 5.7 nm with delays after the laser flash increase from 200 ns to 30 µs at the lowest temperature studied 20 K. This is caused by faster recombination of CTS with shorter electron–hole distance. The electron–hole exchange interaction is about J/h = 1.15 MHz for the smallest interspin distance obtained r0 = 2.5 nm. The overall similarity of the initial electron–hole distance and CTS recombination rate for DTS:PC71BM and polymer/fullerene OPV composites studied previously points to similar photoinduced charge separation mechanisms for these systems.

The optimization aims to find the best light-trapping profile of the hole transfer layer that can absorb more light and minimize reflection. The optimization is done using Genetic Algorithm and by considering the PCE as the primary objective function. The results show that the PCE of P3HT:PCBM increases from 3.96% to 4.45% by using the optimized shape. Also, the same optimized shape can be used with other OPV materials like PTB7:PC71BM at which the PCE increases from 8.2% to 8.9%."
152,152,10.1109/JPROC.2019.2929797,,,Organic Photovoltaics: Toward Self-Powered Wearable Electronics,2019,"In the past several years, research in soft and flexible electronics has promised to yield developments in wearable technology, including health and fitness monitoring tools, independence and mobility aids for the disabled, and human–computer interfaces for virtual and augmented reality. However, as these devices become thinner and lighter, they demand efficient power supplies with similar mechanical properties. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs)—–known for their high flexibility, lightweight, and scalable fabrication methods—have recently attained power conversion efficiencies of over 17% and are excellent candidates to power these next-generation wearable devices. In this paper, we discuss recent developments in flexible OPVs, including advances in materials, structure, and integration with additional wearable components, such as sensors and displays. In addition, we describe our recent work in developing a self-powered actuator for a tactile feedback system."
153,153,10.1002/adma.201904512,,,1 cm<sup>2</sup> Organic Photovoltaic Cells for Indoor Application with over 20% Efficiency,2019,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies have the advantages of fabricating larger-area and light-weight solar panels on flexible substrates by low-cost roll-to-toll production. Recently, OPV cells have achieved many significant advances with power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing rapidly. However, large-scale solar farms using OPV modules still face great challenges, such as device stability. Herein, the applications of OPV cells in indoor light environments are studied. Via optimizing the active layers to have a good match with the indoor light source, 1 cm2 OPV cells are fabricated and a top PCE of 22% under 1000 lux light-emitting diode (2700 K) illumination is demonstrated. In this work, the light intensities are measured carefully. Incorporated with the external quantum efficiency and photon flux spectrum, the integral current densities of the cells are calculated to confirm the reliability of the photovoltaic measurement. In addition, the devices show much better stability under continuous indoor light illumination. The results suggest that designing wide-bandgap active materials to meet the requirements for the indoor OPV cells has a great potential in achieving higher photovoltaic performance."
154,154,10.1002/smll.201902602,,,Two Well-Compatible Acceptors with Efficient Energy Transfer Enable Ternary Organic Photovoltaics Exhibiting a 13.36% Efficiency,2019,"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are fabricated with PM6 as donor and T6Me, IT-2F, or their mixture as acceptor. A 13.36% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved from the optimized ternary OPVs with 50 wt% IT-2F in acceptors, which is attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting of ternary active layers and improved exciton utilization efficiency through energy transfer from IT-2F to T6Me. The efficient energy transfer from IT-2F to T6Me can be confirmed from the photoluminescence spectra of neat and blend films, which may provide additional channels to enhance exciton utilization efficiency for achieving short-circuit current density (JSC ) improvement of ternary OPVs. It should be highlighted that the fill factor (FF) of ternary OPVs can be monotonously increased along with the incorporation of IT-2F, indicating the gradually optimized phase separation degree of ternary active layers. The third component IT-2F plays a key role in optimizing phase separation as a morphology regulator. Over 8% PCE improvement is achieved in the optimized ternary OPVs compared with the over 12% PCEs of the corresponding binary OPVs, respectively. This work indicates that the performance of ternary OPVs can be well optimized by carefully picking materials with good compatibility and complementary absorption spectra, as well as the appropriate energy levels."

As a proof of concept, an organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell was used to power the chip SL900A that incorporates a sensor front-end interface capable of measuring voltages, currents, resistances, and capacitances. Several read range measurements were realized using other types of power sources and compared to OPV. Results based on the OPV cell showed a significant enhancement in the tag read range (up to 80%) under low light conditions which opens the door for several IoT applications."
156,156,10.1063/1.5115260,,,Antimony doped tin oxide/polyethylenimine electron selective contact for reliable and light soaking-free high performance inverted organic solar cells,2019,"We have demonstrated a high-performance low temperature solution processed electron selective contact consisting of 10 at% antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) and the neutral polymer polyethylenimine (PEI). Inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) utilizing ATO/PEI as electron selective contact exhibited high power conversion efficiencies for both the reference P3HT: PCBM and the non-fullerene based P3HT- IDTBR active layer OPV material systems. Importantly it is shown that the proposed ATO/PEI carrier selective contact provides light soaking-free inverted OPVs. Furthermore, by increasing the thickness of ATO layer from 40 to 120 nm the power conversion efficiency of the corresponding inverted OPVs remain unaffected a parameter which indicates the potential of the proposed ATO/PEI carrier selective contact for high performance light-soaking-free and reliable roll-to-roll printing solutions processed inverted OPVs."

We propose that performance reduction is a result of the poor transverse charge transport due to defects in the electron transport layer and the resistance of the transparent electrode. We modified the surface of a zinc oxide (ZnO) with ethoxylated polyethylenimine and successfully lowered the performance reduction from 30% to 15% based on two electron transport layers of ZnO and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE)-modified ZnO (ZnO/PEIE bilayer and ZnO:PEIE hybrid layer). We also deposited Ag grids on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate to facilitate transverse charge transport in the ITO.
158,158,10.1002/adma.201903441,,,Eco-Compatible Solvent-Processed Organic Photovoltaic Cells with Over 16% Efficiency,2019,"Recent advances in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have enabled the rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. However, this progress is achieved using highly toxic solvents, which are not suitable for the scalable large-area processing method, becoming one of the biggest factors hindering the mass production and commercial applications of OPVs. Therefore, it is of great importance to get good eco-compatible processability when designing efficient OPV materials. Here, to achieve high efficiency and good processability of the NFAs in eco-compatible solvents, the flexible alkyl chains of the highly efficient NFA BTP-4F-8 (also known as Y6) are modified and BTP-4F-12 is synthesized. Combining with the polymer donor PBDB-TF, BTP-4F-12 shows the best PCE of 16.4%. Importantly, when the polymer donor PBDB-TF is replaced by T1 with better solubility, various eco-compatible solvents can be applied to fabricate OPV cells. Finally, over 14% efficiency is obtained with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the processing solvent for 1.07 cm2 OPV cells by the blade-coating method. These results indicate that the simple modification of the side chain can be used to tune the processability of active layer materials and thus make it more applicable for the mass production with environmentally benign solvents."
160,160,10.1016/j.solener.2019.06.044,,,Switching on optical properties of D-Π-A DSSC sensitizers from Π-spacers towards machine learning,2019,"Abstract Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells recently achieved a reported efficiency as high as 17.3%. In this study we explore new avenues of shifting the light absorber through rational design of the π-spacers in the Donor–π-spacer–Acceptor dyes. That is, to construct high performing new dyes with fixed donor (DCPA) and acceptor (PMID) from appropriate π-building units of fluorene, EDOT and thiophene. These three π-units form various combinations of the π-conjugate spacers for new dyes. We focus on the development of the relationship between the three building units of π-spacers to construct new DCPA–π-spacer–PMID dyes and their UV–vis spectra in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The latter (i.e., UV–vis spectra) are calculated using quantum mechanical time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods. This set of nine new organic dyes has been employed to develop augmented intelligence (AI). We discovered that repeating the fluorene (πO) unit alone in the π-spacer, such as OP100, OP200 and OP300 dyes, will lead to hyperchromic enhancement of the donor spectral band in the UV region of ca. 300 nm, with limited impact on the major spectral band at 500 nm which is stemmed from the acceptor (PMID). To maximize the UV–vis absorption, more efficient π-spacers for this class of dyes are constructed from mixtures of the fluorene (πO) and EDOT (πP) units, such as πO-πP-πO (OP210) or as πO-πP-πO-πP (OP220). The information obtained is useful to elucidate new dyes with desired properties with appropriate UV–vis spectra for future machine learning (ML)."
161,161,10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.05.003,,,Testing organic photovoltaic modules for application as greenhouse cover or shading element,2019,"This study examines the feasibility of using semi-transparent, flexible organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules as greenhouse shading material. By using such modules, it may be possible to utilise existing greenhouse-based agricultural areas for electricity production. Using OPV modules to shade greenhouses and reduce excess solar energy may result in reduced heat load on the crop on the one hand, and use of renewable energy on the other. We examined the radiometric and thermal properties of an OPV module. Module transmissivity was measured under outdoor conditions at four different angles of radiation incidence: 0, 21, 41 and 46°. Simultaneously, the open-circuit voltage, and short-circuit current of the module were recorded for power and efficiency calculations. Supplementary laboratory measurements of transmissivity, reflectivity and absorptivity were performed with a spectroradiometer. To further characterise the OPV module, its overall heat-transfer coefficient (U value) was determined. The examined module had about 20% transmissivity, 15% reflectivity and 65% absorptance in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range. The mean daily power conversion efficiency of the module was about 0.8% and the overall heat transfer coefficient U, was about 6.0 Wm−2 K−1. The temperature of a module placed on the polyethylene cover of a greenhouse high tunnel was about 50–55 °C at midday. Thermal images of the module revealed non-uniform heat distribution, with temperature differences between regions reaching up to 7.5 °C. OPV modules appear to be suitable for greenhouse shading and electricity generation but currently they are too expensive and their life duration is relatively short."

In response to the importation of wild polio virus, the Ministry decided to take preventive action by administering oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to all children born after 1 January 2004 who had received at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the past. This study analyzes the vaccination uptake rates resulting from the mass polio vaccination campaign on the basis of health inequality parameters of socioeconomic status (SES), principles of solidarity, and the Gini inequality index. The research explores understanding the value of the Gini inequality index within the context of SES and solidarity.MethodsThe study is based on data gathered from the Israeli Ministry of Health’s administrative records from mother-and-child clinics across Israel. The research population is comprised of resident infants and children whom the Ministry of Health defined as eligible for the OPV between August and December 2013 (the “campaign period”). The analysis was carried out at the municipality level as well as the statistical area level.ResultsThe higher the SES level of the municipality where the mother-and-child clinic is located, the lower the OPV vaccination uptake is. The greater the income inequality is in the municipality where the mother-and-child clinic is situated, the lower the vaccination uptake.ConclusionsPublic health professionals promoting vaccine programs need to make specially-designed efforts both in localities with high average income and in localities with a high level of income diversity/inequality. Such practice will better utilize funds, resources, and manpower dedicated to increasing vaccination uptake across varying populations and communities."

We speculate that ion impurity has impact on an efficiency and lifetime of OPV devices and confirm that there is a remarkable correlation between the concentration of ion impurity and the OPV characteristics.
166,166,10.1109/TED.2019.2917594,,,Influence of Active Layer Thickness on the Performance of Organic Photovoltaics with Light Trapping,2019,"To maximize the performance of a photovoltaic device, light trapping is necessary. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effect of active layer thickness on the performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with ideal light trapping. Although actual light trapping schemes are not ideal, this paper can still be useful in guiding us in maximizing the performance of actual OPVs with light trapping. The effect of active layer thickness on the power conversion efficiency (PCE), short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor (FF) of OPVs with ideal light trapping is described in this paper. For a low-recombination-loss OPV with ideal light trapping, the active layer thickness weakly affects the PCE. For a high-recombination-loss OPV with ideal light trapping, the active layer thickness strongly affects the PCE and must be very thin (around 10 nm) in order to maximize the PCE. Therefore, this paper shows that it is important for OPVs to have a low recombination loss so that the active layer thickness does not become a hindrance or an additional factor in creating highly efficient light trapping schemes that can maximize the PCE. This paper also shows that it is equally (if not more) important to develop light trapping schemes that are highly efficient at very thin active layers (around 10 nm) so that the PCE of any OPVs can be more or less maximized, whether the OPVs have low or high recombination losses."

For that purpose, ST-OPVs should achieve adequate transparency and performance stability. In this regard, the present research deals with the experimental performance of three different building-integrated ST-OPV technologies (technology A: developed in the frame of the present study; technologies B and C: commercial modules). More specifically, spectral transmittance and electrical measurements have been conducted in order to determine the characteristics of the modules for building integration and electricity generation purposes. Results regarding the transmittance reveal that technology A outperforms technologies B and C. The stability analysis of the modules verifies that module C is the most stable one with almost no decrease (3.6%) in the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, the PCE of technology B is slightly higher than in the case of technology C, which experiences a PCE degradation of about 10–15% over the whole time period. Finally, technology A presents a 20% reduction in PCE at around 500 h."

The PV-based LiFi receiver is first exposed to an additional homogeneous light source with different intensity levels and then the influence of partial lighting is studied (shading effect). In both cases, we compare the sensibility and the cutoff frequency of LiFi transmission when the solar cell is operated either in short- circuit mode (i.e. when it is loaded with an active transimpedance amplifier) or in open circuit mode (i.e. when it is terminated with an high impedance passive load). While the OPV module performance decreases in open-circuit mode as a function of the DC illumination level, we observe an improvement of the cutoff frequency in short circuit mode. This result seems very promising for outdoor LiFi transmissions but also for indoor conditions where natural light can disturb LiFi communications. Theoretical explanations involving physical parameters for energy harvesting (carrier mobility, lumped series resistance) are proposed to justify the observed behaviors. Finally, experimental results of shaded solar cells are provided in the two operating modes (open-circuit and short-circuit). We show that sensibility and bandwidth of OPV modules strongly depend on both the shading configuration and the operating mode."

173,173,10.1002/adma.201806004,,,Photogenerated Charge Transport in Organic Electronic Materials: Experiments Confirmed by Simulations,2019,"The performance of organic optoelectronic devices, such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, is to a large extent dictated by their ability to transport the photogenerated charge, with relevant processes spanning a wide temporal (fs-µs) and spatial (1-100 nm) range. However, time-resolved techniques can access only a limited temporal window, and often contradict steady-state measurements. Here, commonly employed steady-state and time-resolved techniques are unified over an exceptionally wide temporal range (fs-µs) in a consistent physical picture. Experimental evidence confirmed by numerical simulations shows that, although various techniques probe different time scales, they are mutually consistent as they probe the same physical mechanisms governing charge motion in disordered media-carrier hopping and thermalization in a disorder-broadened density of states (DOS). The generality of this framework is highlighted by time-resolved experimental data obtained on polymer:fullerene, polymer:polymer, and small-molecule blends with varying morphology, including recent experiments revealing that low donor content OPV devices operate by long-range hole tunneling between non-nearest-neighbor molecules. The importance of nonequilibrium processes in organic electronic materials is reviewed, with a particular focus on experimental data and understanding charge transport physics in terms of material DOS."

By definition, any clinical infection caused by a LAV that is sufficiently severe to require medical intervention attests to an inherited or acquired immunodeficiency that must be diagnosed or identified. Self-healing infections can also result from milder forms of immunodeficiency. We review here the inherited forms of immunodeficiency underlying severe infections of LAVs. Inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) underlying bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), oral poliovirus (OPV), vaccine measles virus (vMeV), and oral rotavirus vaccine (ORV) disease have been described from 1951, 1963, 1966, and 2009 onward, respectively. For each of these four LAVs, the underlying IEIs show immunological homogeneity despite genetic heterogeneity. Specifically, BCG disease is due to inborn errors of IFN-γ immunity, OPV disease to inborn errors of B cell immunity, vMeV disease to inborn errors of IFN-α/β and IFN-λ immunity, and ORV disease to adaptive immunity. Severe reactions to the other 11 LAVs have been described yet remain “idiopathic,” in the absence of known underlying inherited or acquired immunodeficiencies, and are warranted to be the focus of research efforts. The study of IEIs underlying life-threatening LAV infections is clinically important for the affected patients and their families, as well as immunologically, for the study of the molecular and cellular basis of host defense against both attenuated and parental pathogens."
175,175,10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.01.093,,,Electronic structure of Ba(OH) <inf>2</inf> interface in inverted organic photovoltaics: Improved electron transport by charged state of C <inf>60</inf>,2019,"Abstract Lowering the work function (WF) of the cathode in inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is critically important to obtaining a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The insertion of functional interlayers between the cathode and acceptor is a widely employed strategy to lower the WF. Among these functional materials, Ba(OH)2 is known to be an efficient solution-processable cathode buffer layer that improves the electron transport in organic optoelectronic devices. Despite several reports of device performance enhancement with the use of a Ba(OH)2 layer, its interfacial energetics is yet to be clearly understood. In this study, we investigated the electronic structure of Ba(OH)2 interfaces and the improvement in the PCE of inverted small molecule OPVs with the use of a Ba(OH)2 layer. On implementing the optimum thickness of the Ba(OH)2 layer, the PCE of the OPVs was significantly enhanced from 1.29% to 3.41%, and the S-shaped kink in the current-density–voltage curve was eliminated. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, we explored the interfacial electronic structures of C60/indium tin oxide (ITO) and C60/Ba(OH)2/ITO using in situ photoelectron spectroscopy. The spin-coated Ba(OH)2 was physisorbed onto the ITO, which significantly reduced its WF. Owing to the Ba(OH)2, the reduced WF of the ITO is lower than the electron affinity of C60. Thus, a charge transfer is induced from Ba(OH)2/ITO to C60, and the charged states of C60 are observed within the monolayer. These charged states result in significant band bending in the C60 layer, such that its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level shifts toward the Fermi level (EF) of the Ba(OH)2/ITO. As a result, the energy offset between the C60 LUMO level and the cathode EF is substantially reduced from 0.45 eV to 0.15 eV with the use of the Ba(OH)2 layer. This is the origin of the enhanced device performance of OPVs."
177,177,10.1021/jacs.8b12982,,,High Exciton Diffusion Coefficients in Fused Ring Electron Acceptor Films,2019,"Modest exciton diffusion lengths dictate the need for nanostructured bulk heterojunctions in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells; however, this morphology compromises charge collection. Here, we reveal rapid exciton diffusion in films of a fused-ring electron acceptor that, when blended with a donor, already outperforms fullerene-based OPV cells. Temperature-dependent ultrafast exciton annihilation measurements are used to resolve a quasi-activationless exciton diffusion coefficient of at least 2 × 10-2 cm2/s, substantially exceeding typical organic semiconductors and consistent with the 20-50 nm domain sizes in optimized blends. Enhanced three-dimensional diffusion is shown to arise from molecular and packing factors; the rigid planar molecular structure is associated with low reorganization energy, good transition dipole moment alignment, high chromophore density, and low disorder, all enhancing long-range resonant energy transfer. Relieving exciton diffusion constraints has important implications for OPVs; large, ordered, and pure domains enhance charge separation and transport, and suppress recombination, thereby boosting fill factors. Further enhancements to diffusion lengths may even obviate the need for the bulk heterojunction morphology."
178,178,10.1016/j.orgel.2019.02.020,,,Photovoltaic donor-acceptor conjugated polymers with minimally substituted acceptor moieties,2019,"Abstract A novel family of conjugated donor-acceptor (D-A) copolymers designed with comparatively small methyl substituted acceptor units was synthesized for use as donor phase materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications. These polymers make use of common acceptor moieties thieno [3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and isoindigo (iI) with methyl side chains to provide sterically unhindered sites for enhanced interactions with a molecular acceptor (MA), either PC71BM or ITIC in this study. The resulting polymers P(T4-TPD-M), P(T4-DPP-M), and P(T4-iI-M) were utilized in BHJ OPV devices where the highest performing D-A polymer, P(T4-TPD-M), obtained a maximum PCE of 7.5% with PC71BM and 4.0% with ITIC. These results indicate that minimally-sized methyl side chain derivatives of TPD, DPP, and iI can be useful acceptor moieties in D-A polymer systems, and the impact of sterics on the acceptor moiety can be elucidated in future studies through modification of the methyl side chain to bulkier aliphatic substituents."
179,179,10.1016/j.orgel.2019.01.050,,,Enhancement of the power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic cells due to Au@SiO<inf>2</inf> core shell nanoparticles embedded into a WO<inf>3</inf> hole transport layer,2019,"Abstract Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based on Au@SiO2-WO3 nanocomposites (NCs) embedded into a hole transport layer (HTL) were fabricated to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of those cells. The morphology of the Au@SiO2-WO3 NC film was uniform without any aggregation of the Au nanoparticles (NPs) resulting from the existence in the SiO2 shell of the Au@SiO2 NPs. With the optimized Au@SiO2 NP concentration of 5 wt%, the short-circuit current density and PCE of the OPV cells were enhanced by 125% and 31%, respectively, compared to the OPV cells containing WO3 NPs. The PCE enhancement of the OPV cells with a Au@SiO2-WO3 NC HTL originated from an increase in the short-circuit current density due to the enhanced the photon absorption resulting from the localized surface plasmon resonance effect and the enhanced hole extraction capability of the Au@SiO2-WO3 NC HTL."
180,180,10.1016/j.renene.2018.12.051,,,Experimental performance of commercial OPV panels tested outdoor,2019,"Abstract This work presents the experimental performance of commercial versions of organic photovoltaic (OPV) panels. Twenty four commercialized OPV panels of two different sizes ( 2.52 × 0.52 m and 1.29 × 0.52 m) were examined. Unfortunately, the company that provides the panels does not inform the technology behind the OPV they commercialize, but it provided a datasheet. We designed an outdoor test bench to make a parallelization between the commercial technology and scientific literature. The panels were bonded over a 0.04-m-thick acrylic layer to provide mechanical resistance and a clear view of the backside. The test bench was designed to allow panel tilt angles to be varied manually. We measured the total, beam, and diffuse radiation, along with the solar spectrum and all environmental conditions. Various topologies were tested, and results of power conversion efficiency ( P C E ) are presented. P C E was approximately 2% for all OPV panels, and was nearly stable during the four months of testing. P C E provided in the datasheet is ∼ 3%, suggesting a loss of efficiency during the burn-in period."
181,181,10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.02.021,,,Potentially self-dopable poly(3-hexylthiophene) block copolymers/carbon nanotube nanocomposites for enhanced processibility and electrical properties,2019,"Abstract Development of new hole-transport layer (HTL) materials for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications is one crucial issue to mitigate such limitations of low power efficiency, processibility, and stability derived from poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a common HTL material. To this end, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based diblock copolymers including the different ratios between polystyrene (PSty) or/and poly(neopentyl styrene sulfonate) (PNSS) as a second block segment were designed and then used for incorporating with single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to form potentially self-dopable nanocomposites. The structure of fabricated P3HT-based diblock copolymer/SWCNT nanocomposites was examined by microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations, exhibiting a charge transfer behavior between P3HT and SWCNT, and growth of the P3HT crystalline phase along the SWCNT surface with a form of the conducting path. The acquired SWCNT nanocomposites exhibited good solubility and dispersion in various organic solvents including toluene, chlorobenzene, THF, chloroform, and DMF, which are good solvents for the PSty or/and PNSS neutral second block. The concept for the neutralized second block by protecting groups can prevent the poisoning ITO substrate by water contamination as shown in the conventional aqueous PEDOT-PSS solution. Notably, the PNSS constituent in the nanocomposite was merely acidified to give in-situ sulfonic acid groups in PSty by simple thermolysis process at 160 °C for 30 min after a solution process for fabrication of a thin film. The thermolysis step provided efficient doping of P3HT by PSS, in which the thiophene groups worked as Bronsted base are protonated by taking protons from sulfonic acid groups and then lead to a form of ionic bonds between cationic thiophene and anionic sulfonate groups. In addition, the formed ionic bonds in the nanocomposites led to an insoluble thin film, which has a good advantage for the further solvent process without substantial damages. The beneficial features of the conducting path along SWCNT and the efficient doping of P3HT by PSS in the acquired nanocomposites led to ca. 5-fold higher electrical conductivity (3.16 S cm−1) and similar work function (5.1 eV) in comparison to water contained commercial PEDOT:PSS (0.6 S cm−1 and 5.0 eV, respectively). As such, the rationally designed potentially self-dopable SWCNT nanocomposites can be one of the promising alternatives beyond the commercial PEDOT: PSS HTL material."
182,182,10.1093/infdis/jiy568,,,Influence of nonpolio enteroviruses and the bacterial gut microbiota on oral poliovirus vaccine response: A study from south India,2019,"Abstract Background Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is less immunogenic in low- or middle-income than in high-income countries. We tested whether bacterial and viral components of the intestinal microbiota are associated with this phenomenon. Methods We assessed the prevalence of enteropathogens using TaqMan array cards 14 days before and at vaccination in 704 Indian infants (aged 6–11 months) receiving monovalent type 3 OPV (CTRI/2014/05/004588). Nonpolio enterovirus (NPEV) serotypes were identified by means of VP1 sequencing. In 120 infants, the prevaccination bacterial microbiota was characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Results We detected 56 NPEV serotypes on the day of vaccination. Concurrent NPEVs were associated with a reduction in OPV seroconversion, consistent across species (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.57 [.36–.90], 0.61 [.43–.86], and 0.69 [.41–1.16] for species A, B, and C, respectively). Recently acquired enterovirus infections, detected at vaccination but not 14 days earlier, had a greater interfering effect on monovalent type 3 OPV seroresponse than did persistent infections, with enterovirus detected at both time points (seroconversion in 44 of 127 infants [35%] vs 63 of 129 [49%]; P = .02). The abundance of specific bacterial taxa did not differ significantly according to OPV response, although the microbiota was more diverse in nonresponders at the time of vaccination. Conclusion Enteric viruses have a greater impact on OPV response than the bacterial microbiota, with recent enterovirus infections having a greater inhibitory effect than persistent infections."
183,183,10.3390/s19081803,,,Combined organic photovoltaic cells and ultra low power CMOS circuit for indoor light energy harvesting,2019,"This paper describes an energy harvesting system composed of an organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) connected to a DC–DC converter, designed in a 130 nm Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, with a quasi- maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm to maximize the system efficiency, for indoor applications. OPVs are an emerging technology with potential for low cost indoor light energy harvesting. The OPV current-voltage curves (I-V) under an irradiance of solar simulator Oriel Sol 3A, at room temperature, are obtained and an accurate electrical model is derived. The energy harvesting system is subjected to four different indoor light sources: 35 W halogen, 3.5 W LED, 5 W LED, and 7 W LED, positioned at three different heights (0.45 m, 0.26 m, and 0.11 m), to evaluate the potential of the system for indoor applications. The measurements showed maximum efficiencies of 60% for 35 W halogen and 45% for 7 W LED at the highest distance (0.45 m) and between 60% (5 W LED) and 70% (35 W halogen), at the shorter distance (0.11 m). Under irradiation, the integrated CMOS circuit presented a maximum efficiency of 75.76%, which is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the best reported power management unit (PMU) energy system using organic photovoltaic cells."
184,184,10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2019.02.002,,,"Current status, challenges and future outlook of high performance polymer semiconductors for organic photovoltaics modules",2019,"Abstract Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules have currently reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of approximately 5% (single junctions devices) which are only suitable in niche markets requiring lightweight, flexibility, and variable angle performance, such as in the consumer electronics market. However, it is expected a significant increase in the PCEs of the OPV technology due to the continuous improvement of high performance polymers, the better understanding of photophysical mechanisms, thin film morphology and the self assembly of the polymer’s chain in the bulk of the active layer. In this review, we summarize the progress in the field of high performance conjugated polymers (PCEs above 9.0%) by identifying suitable candidates for simple and high purity large scale synthetic quantities through their synthetic complexity determination, compatible for fabrication of OPV modules (for example important factors include solubility issues, easy processing, and more important environmental and photochemical stability) that will pave the way for further enhancement of the OPV modules’s efficiency and stability. This is a very significant advance considering that the chemistry of functional conjugated polymers is facing major challenges and suitable materials have to achieve a broad range of specifications to be established as an appropriate choice for high photovoltaic performance."
185,185,10.1016/j.tsf.2019.01.053,,,Thin film deposition method for ZnO nanosheets using low-temperature microwave-excited atmospheric pressure plasma jet,2019,"Abstract Electronic devices such as solar cells and thin-film transistors can be fabricated using thin-film deposition. Low-cost, low-temperature and high-speed deposition methods are required to ensure that the production of devices using thin-film deposition is affordable. Herein, we report the development of a low-cost and simple thin-film deposition method using microwave-excited atmospheric pressure plasma jet (MWAPPJ). MWAPPJ produces a low-temperature (several hundred degrees) plasma under atmospheric conditions, does not require expensive vacuum equipment, and it enables high-speed deposition of thin-films. Zinc acetylacetonate sol-gel precursors that were adhered to stainless steel mesh targets were irradiated by MWAPPJ with oxygen, which resulted in zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheet thin-films with diameters of 100–200 nm on silicon substrates. We used 50-nm-thick ZnO thin-films that were processed using MWAPPJ as the electron collection layer in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. This work represents an important contribution to the design and production of low-cost OPV solar cells."
187,187,10.22207/JPAM.13.1.45,,,Sabin vaccine in poliomyelitis eradication: Achievements and risks,2019,"Poliomyelitis eradication using the oral polio vaccine (OPV), also known as the Sabin vaccine, has been a major medical achievement led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and various countries. The OPV has been administered over 10 billion times to three billion children and has prevented over 13 million polio cases. With the more recent appearance of OPV-related complications, especially the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) and vaccine-associated polio paralysis, it is important to reconsider the role of this vaccine in polio eradication. Since 2014, the number of VDPV cases has exceeded the number of wild polio virus cases. Given that OPV is the only source of VDPV, an established phased plan to withdraw OPV from use and switch to an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was determined. Therefore, countries that still use the OPV in their national immunization programs need to develop adequate plans for supplying IPV in an effective and affordable manner. IPV provides protection against polio, but is insufficient for protection against poliovirus circulation when administered alone. Genetically engineered stabilized, live vaccines are being developed and guarantee the profit of Sabin OPV without the risk."
188,188,10.3390/polym11030544,,,Optimizing polymer solar cells using non-halogenated solvent blends,2019,"More environmentally friendly polymer solar cells were constructed using a conjugated polymer, poly (2,5-thiophene-alt-4,9-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-4,9-dihydrodithieno[3,2-c:3′,2′h][1,5] naphthyridine-5,10-dione, PTNT, as a donor material in combination with PC71BM as an acceptor in a bulk heterojunction device structure. A non-halogenated processing solvent (o-xylene) and solvent additives that are less harmful to the environment such as 1-methoxynaphthalene (MN) and 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) were used throughout the study as processing solvents. The most widely used halogenated solvent additives (1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)) were also used for comparison and to understand the effect of the type of solvent additives on the photovoltaic performances. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the surface morphology of the films prepared in the presence of the various additives. The best-performing polymer solar cells provided a high open-circuit voltage of 0.9 V, an efficient fill factor of around 70%, and a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 6% with the use of the eco-friendlier o-xylene/MN solvent systems. Interestingly, the solvent blend which is less harmful and with low environmental impact gave a 20% rise in PCE as compared to an earlier reported device efficiency that was processed from the chlorinated solvent o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB)."

We hypothesised that neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS) would improve oral vaccine responses. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of infants recruited at birth to the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies (ZVITAMBO) trial, a randomised controlled trial of single, high-dose NVAS vs placebo conducted in Zimbabwe between 1997–2001. We measured poliovirus-specific IgA to type 1–3 polio strains by semiquantitative capture ELISA in cryopreserved plasma samples collected at 6 months of age. Results A total of 181 infants fulfilled inclusion criteria, of whom 80 were randomised to NVAS and 101 to placebo. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. At 6 months of age, median (IQR) vaccine titres for infants randomised to NVAS vs placebo were 932 (421–3001) vs 1774 (711–5431) for Sabin-1 (p=0.04); 1361 (705–3402) vs 2309 (1081–4283) for Sabin-2 (p=0.15); and 1584 (796–4216) vs 2260 (996–5723) for Sabin-3 (p=0.14), respectively. After adjusting for breast feeding status, birth weight, season and infant sex in a linear regression model, there was only weak evidence of difference in log mean titres between vitamin A and placebo groups for Sabin-1 (p=0.08) and no evidence of difference in log mean titres for Sabin-2 and Sabin-3. Conclusions NVAS did not augment oral polio vaccine responses in Zimbabwean infants. Further research is required to understand the impact of NVAS on responses to other oral vaccines. The trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00198718."
190,190,10.1016/j.joule.2018.11.006,,,Quenching to the Percolation Threshold in Organic Solar Cells,2019,"Summary The general lack of knowing the quench depth and the convolution with key kinetic factors has confounded deeper understanding of the respective importance of these factors in the morphology development of organic solar cells. Here, we determine the quench depth of a high-efficiency system and delineate the need to kinetically quench the mixed domains to a composition close to the percolation threshold. Importantly, the ability to achieve such a quench is very sensitive to structural parameters in polymer solar cells (PSCs) of the polymer PBDB-TF. Only the highest-molecular-weight polymer is able of earlier liquid-solid transition to “lock in” a high-performing PSC morphology with a composition above the miscibility limit and with an efficiency of over 13%. Systems with deep quench depths are therefore sensitive to molecular weight and the kinetic factors of the casting, likely impacting fabrication yield and reliability. They also need to be vitrified for stable performance."

These comparisons indicate that PTB7-Th film chains are somewhat thicker and less spaced than those for PTB7; also, PTB7-Th films have a slightly better organized structure and higher co-planarity, which could provide a possible better electrical charge transport. On the order hand, an analysis of the external/internal quantum efficiency (EQE/IQE) of OPVs, based on PTB7-Th, as a function of the active layer thickness ranging from 40 to 165 nm was carried out. It was used the bulk heterojunction architecture to fabricate OPVs cells under the configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/FM (Field’s Metal: eutectic alloy, composed by 32.5% Bi, 51% In and 16.5% Sn by weight that melts at 62 °C). IQE spectra were determined by using the active layer absorption calculated through the transfer matrix method (TMM). Our results show a significant reduction of IQE when increasing the active layer thickness above 120 nm. IQE decreases, and consequently EQE and PCE, mainly due to the reduction in charge carriers collection probability. On the reversed side, when the active layer is very thin (< 70 nm), there exists also a decrease in the IQE values. A comparison between the experimental measurements and theoretical simulations (by TMM) is discussed in order to have better understanding of the OPVs performance.

These hole contact layers are developed from superoxidized MoO3.2 films grown by reactive sputtering, followed by postannealing in high vacuum to induce crystallization of the otherwise amorphous MoOx films.

With respect to the reference device (without FeS2), a 21% increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is observed for OPVs with 0.5 wt % FeS2, such that the PCE of the OPVs is enhanced from 5.69 to 6.47%. According to the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney statistical tests, all OPV devices follow the same trend."
204,204,10.2217/fmb-2019-0196,,,Poliopolis: Pushing boundaries of scientific innovations for disease eradication,2019,"Although global polio eradication is within reach, sustained eradication of all polioviruses requires cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine use to mitigate against vaccine-derived poliovirus circulation and vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. The first step in this direction was the WHO-recommended global withdrawal of live attenuated type 2 Sabin poliovirus from routine immunisation in May 2016, with future use restricted to outbreak response, and handling controlled by strict containment provisions (GAPIII). This creates unique challenges for development and testing of novel type 2 poliovirus vaccines. We describe the creation of a novel purpose-built containment facility, Poliopolis, to study new monovalent OPV2 vaccine candidates in healthy adult volunteers, which may be a model for future endeavors in vaccine development for emergency use."

This manuscript will highlight efforts by the OPV program at Phillips 66 to solve issues related to material scale-up, through material design combining good processability and high photovoltaic performance.

206,206,10.1039/c9fd00069k,,,Exciton dissociation and charge separation at donor–acceptor interfaces from quantum-classical dynamics simulations,2019,"In organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems, exciton dissociation and ultrafast charge separation at donor-acceptor heterojunctions both play a key role in controlling the efficiency of the conversion of excitation energy into free charge carriers. In this work, nonadiabatic dynamics simulations based on the quantum-classical Liouville equation are employed to study the real-time dynamics of exciton dissociation and charge separation at a model donor-acceptor interface. Benchmark comparisons for a variety of low dimensional donor-acceptor chain models are performed to assess the accuracy of the quantum classical dynamics technique referred to as the forward-backward trajectory solution (FBTS). Although not always quantitative, the FBTS approach offers a reasonable balance between accuracy and computational cost. The short-time dynamics of exciton dissociation in related higher-dimensional lattice models for the interface are also investigated to assess the effect of the dimensionality on the first steps in the mechanism of charge carrier generation."
207,207,10.1021/acsami.9b15480,,,Versatile and Tunable Electrical Properties of Doped Nonoxidized Graphene Using Alkali Metal Chlorides,2019,"With the emergence of wearable and flexible electronics, graphene has recently been developed for transparent electrodes in field effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, and organic photovoltaic cells. Graphene doping methods can decrease sheet resistance and modulate work function while retaining high transparency, for transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs). In this work, a chemical doping method, which incorporates metal chlorides (NaCl, KCl and AuCl3) and organic compounds (HNO3) as chemical dopants, was used to control the charge carrier density, band gap and work function, without damage to the carbon network. Furthermore, we synthesized non-oxidized graphene with large lateral sizes of more than 5 μm using ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). The resulting graphene flake films (DGFFs) doped with AuCl3 exhibited the lowest reported sheet resistance (2.008 X 105 S/m at ~75% transmission), to the best of our knowledge, and controlled the work function from 4.32 eV to 5.1 eV. Doping with interfacial dipole complexes of metal cations with low work function, and reactive radicals like -OH were also considered for tuning sheet resistance and work function. An organic photovoltaic device (OPV) using Au-DGFFs as a hole transporting layer (HTL) demonstrated enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) while maintaining high optical transparency in visible light. This approach to forming transparent conducting electrodes is expected to open numerous potential DGFFs applications."
208,208,10.1270/jsbbs.18121,,,Genetic and phenotypic assessment of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris) elite inbred lines selected in Japan during the past 50 years,2019,"Genetic diversity of Japanese sugar beet elite inbred line diversity (JSBDIV) set consisting of 63 lines was investigated using 33 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and 38 simple sequence repeat analyses. JSBDIV set was significantly subdivided into six (pedigree information), seven (Neighbor-Joining method) or 12 (population structure analysis) groups. The highest value of a pairwise population differentiation estimate, ΦPT value, among groups was yielded from population structure analysis with explained variation 32%. Some of the groups defined in this study exhibited close association with ancestral open-pollinated varieties (OPVs), suggesting that inter-OPV cross was rare during the establishment of JSBDIV set. On the other hand, low ΦPT values between some groups suggest that genetic backgrounds of ancestral OPVs had historically overlapped to some extent. Phenotypic traits showed significant differences both among and within groups. A nearly identical group was identified as the highest sugar content group irrespective of the grouping methods. Groups with Aphanomyces root rot resistance are associated with an OPV ‘Tmm-1’, suggesting it as a source of this trait. ‘Tmm-1’ is also associated with Cercospora leaf spot resistance, but an exceptional resistant line with no association of ‘Tmm-1’ supports a notion that different genetic resources exist for this trait."

The layers were produced by using small molecular compounds: the metal-phthalocyanine (MePc) and perylene derivatives (PTCDA) and the titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles. Two kinds of metal phthalocyanines (NiPc, TiOPc) were used as donor material and pperylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) as an acceptor. The used manufacturing technique allowed to employ thin layers of materials in a fast deposition process. Bulk heterojunction was created by simultaneously applying the MePc:PTCDA materials during the evaporation of the components mixture.The research was based on the estimate of composition of bulk heterojunction, the examination of the surface morphology of the used layers and optical properties studies of the heterojunction and its implementation to photovoltaic architecture. The produced photovoltaic cells parameters were determined on the basis of current - voltage characteristics.The researches of structure of obtained layers were conducted by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The quantitative determination of surface topography by determining RMS and Ra coefficients were performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In order to determine the optical properties of the films the UV-Visible spectroscope have been utilized. Current - voltage characteristics were employed to determine the basic photovoltaic parameters using a dedicated device.The paper describes the influence of the individual components sharing the bulk heterojunction on its structure, optical properties and morphology of surface. In addition it allows for linking active layers properties with the parameters of the photovoltaic cells. The obtained results suggest the possibility of developing the utilized materials and technology in the further works on photovoltaic structures."
210,210,10.7567/1347-4065/ab0742,,,Investigation of the power generation of organic photovoltaic modules connected to the power grid for more than three years,2019,"In this paper, we report on the power generation of commercial organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules installed outdoors at the Kyushu Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology for more than three years. The OPV modules were connected to a power conditioner system together with crystalline Si, hydrogenated amorphous Si, and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 photovoltaic (PV) modules. We investigated the output power degradation of the commercial OPV and other PV modules due to aging. We found that there are three distinctive changes in the output power of the OPV modules: (1) rapid initial degradation, (2) gradual secondary degradation, and (3) seasonal variation. We believe that the seasonal variation is due to the metastability of the solar cells. We analyzed the output power behavior in detail based on the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and we compared the outdoor and indoor measurements. We also found that the change in I–V characteristics of the OPV modules due to light soaking are reversible."
211,211,10.3390/en12101870,,,Energy and luminous performance investigation of an OPV/ETFE glazing element for building integration,2019,"The combination of architectural membranes such as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) foils and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells offers a wide range of possibilities for building integration applications. This is due to their flexibility, free-shape, variable color and semitransparency, light weight, cost-effectivity, and low environmental impact. In addition, electrical generation is provided. Four configurations of ETFE foils designed to be integrated onto a south facade glazing element were studied for two representative European locations with different climatic conditions: Barcelona and Paris. These configurations comprise a reference one based on a double ETFE foil with a 10 mm air gap in between, and the other three incorporate on the inner ETFE foil either OPV cells covering 50% or 100% of its surface or a shading pattern printed on it covering 50% of its surface. Results show that, in terms of energy, the configuration with higher OPV coverage area is the one achieving the lowest net energy consumption in both locations. However, when looking at the illumination comfort this option results in insufficient illumination levels. Therefore, a tradeoff strategy balancing energy performance and illumination comfort conditions is necessary. Based on that, the best solution found for both cities is the configuration integrating OPV cells covering 50% of the glazing area and for a window to wall ratio of 0.45."

Here, we designed and synthesized a naphthobispyrazine derivative bearing four ester groups (eNPz) as a new electron-deficient building unit and three eNPz-based semiconducting polymers with different donor units, that is, bithiophene (PeNPz2T), terthiophene (PeNPz3T), and quaterthiophene (PeNPz4T). These new polymers have relatively deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of around −3.5 eV, along with narrow optical band gaps of around 1.5 eV. The LUMO energy levels and the optical band gaps are significantly deeper and narrower than those of a polymer based on alkylated naphthobispyrazine. The results indicate that eNPz has a strong electron deficiency. The polymers show reasonably high power conversion efficiency of more than 6% in OPV cells in combination with a fullerene derivative.

213,213,10.7567/1347-4065/aafe6b,,,Effects of optical interference and optimized crystallinity in organic photovoltaic cells with a low-bandgap small molecule fabricated by dry process,2019,"Low-bandgap molecules have been used in the photoactive layer of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to achieve higher open-circuit voltage and absorb light with longer wavelength for improving power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, we report on the effect of the film characteristics of N-(n-hexyl)-tetracene carboxylic acid 5,6-imide-11,12-disulfide (Hexyl-TIDS) as a p-type organic semiconductor by introducing an n-type organic semiconductor C60 as an underlayer. Also, we investigate the effects on the performance of OPV devices by optimizing the device structure. Regarding the inverted structure, the crystallinity of Hexyl-TIDS is decreased by adding C60. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency is increased owing to the optical interference effect over the absorption range of C60. Sixfold enhancement of the PCE is achieved due to the optical interference effects and low-crystallinity of Hexyl-TIDS film compared to the conventional structure."
214,214,10.1016/j.synthmet.2018.12.015,,,On the homogeneity of the external quantum efficiency in a free OPV roll-to-roll flexible solar module,2019,"Abstract We present a microscopic characterization of an organic photovoltaic (OPV) module demonstrator, fabricated within the “freeOPV” project. The local properties of the module are discussed on different length scales, from the submicrometric to the centimeters one, inferring the module structure and the origin of the different contributions to the optical and photoelectrical spatial inhomogeneity. We show that the local external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the individual cells of the module exhibits typical variations within 6–8% of the peak value over about 0.4 mm2. Larger variations are observed when comparing different cells across the module surface, with differences in the EQE peak values up to 1.6 times. Our results suggest that the roll-to-roll OPV module performance can be further improved by optimizing the printing uniformity as well as the charge extraction efficiency of electrodes."
215,215,10.1016/j.orgel.2018.10.008,,,Surface plasmon spectroscopy of thin composite films of Au nanoparticles and PEDOT:PSS conjugated polymer,2019,"Abstract We studied the effect of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on optical properties of composite films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) mixed with Au NPs of 20, 40 and 60 nm in diameter by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. The excitation wavelength of SPR redshifts with increasing the concentration of Au NPs in the Au/PEDOT:PSS composite films. The SPR spectra were simulated by using transfer matrix method (TMM) and effective medium approximation (EMA). The SPR wavelength redshift was ascribed to the film thickness increase of Au/PEDOT:PSS composites rather than effective permittivity variation of the composite films induced with Au NPs inclusion."
216,216,10.1016/j.physb.2018.09.027,,,Near-field enhanced performance of organic photovoltaic cells,2019,"Abstract Metal nano-particles (NPs) have been successfully synthesized by the reduction of Ag@Cu2O with the aid of surfactant PVP and excessive reducer ascorbic acid in ambient conditions. The composition and structures of the NPs were characterized by scanning and tunnelling microscopies (SEM and TEM). The synthesized nano-particles were employed as solar absorber in thin film organic photovoltaic (OPV) with the view to exploit the effect of local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the metals. As a consequence, substantial improvement on the major solar cell parameters were measured by the incorporation of Ag@Cu NPs in the P3HT:PCBM based photo-active medium. The power conversion efficiency of the solar cell increased by 103% compared to those devices fabricated without metal nano-particles. The observed balanced charge transport, in the current experiment, is attributed to presence of metal nano-particles in OPV devices which are responsible for near field enhanced photons scattering in the medium."
217,217,10.1002/smll.201804312,,,Fluctuations in the Emission Polarization and Spectrum in Single Chains of a Common Conjugated Polymer for Organic Photovoltaics,2018,"Measuring the nanoscale organization of conjugated polymer chains used in organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends is vital if one wants to understand the materials. This is made very difficult with high efficiency OPV polymers such as PTB7 that form aggregates, as a lack of periodicity and a high degree of disorder make understanding of the nanoscale organization challenging. Here, single molecule spectroscopy is used to observe single chains and aggregates of PTB7. Using four detectors the photoluminescence intensity, wavelength, polarization, and lifetime are simultaneously monitored. Fast (milliseconds) and slow (seconds) fluctuations are observed over a time window of 30 s in all of these observables from single aggregates and chains as individual chromophores activate and deactivate, leading to dynamical changes in the emission spectrum and dipole orientation. This information can be used to help reconstruct the spatial and spectral organization of disordered aggregates of PTB7, thereby adding valuable new information on how the chains are arranged in space."

In this work, the energy offset (EDA) of several donor-acceptor heterojunctions is determined by using the in-situ ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). It was found the substrate workfunction has negligible impact on the energy level alignment between the donor and the acceptor. The planar OPV cell is then fabricated to relate the VOC to the experimentally measured EDA. A surprising transition has been observed in the VOC-EDA plot. A simple mathematical model is developed, based on the exciton dissociation process inside the OPV cell. The model successfully explains the observed transition."
219,219,10.3390/mi9120642,,,Manufacturing of all inkjet-printed organic photovoltaic cell arrays and evaluating their suitability for flexible electronics,2018,"The generation of electrical energy depending on renewable sources is rapidly growing and gaining serious attention due to its green sustainability. With fewer adverse impacts on the environment, the sun is considered as a nearly infinite source of renewable energy in the production of electrical energy using photovoltaic devices. On the other end, organic photovoltaic (OPV) is the class of solar cells that offers several advantages such as mechanical flexibility, solution processability, environmental friendliness, and being lightweight. In this research, we demonstrate the manufacturing route for printed OPV device arrays based on conventional architecture and using inkjet printing technology over an industrial platform. Inkjet technology is presently considered to be one of the most matured digital manufacturing technologies because it offers inherent additive nature and last stage customization flexibility (if the main goal is to obtain custom design devices). In this research paper, commercially available electronically functional inks were carefully selected and then implemented to show the importance of compatibility between OPV material stacks and the device architecture. One of the main outcomes of this work is that the manufacturing of the OPV devices was accomplished using inkjet technology in massive numbers ranging up to 1500 containing different device sizes, all of which were deposited on a flexible polymeric film and under normal atmospheric conditions. In this investigation, it was found that with a set of correct functional materials and architecture, a manufacturing yield of more than 85% could be accomplished, which would reflect high manufacturing repeatability, deposition accuracy, and processability of the inkjet technology."

Herein, we attempt to apply molecular orientation control method to OPV cells using small molecules based on an oligothiophene (DRCN5T) fabricated by wet processing to improve the solar cell performance. The light absorbance of DRCN5T molecules was enhanced by their conversion to face-on molecular orientation, resulting in bulk heterojunction OPV cells with 10% higher power conversion efficiency than that of cells containing DRCN5T with edge-on molecular orientation. Our results suggest a route to develop highly efficient OPV solar cells fabricated by wet processing through precise control of molecular orientation."

It is important to have an overview of solar cell patents distribution in recent years. There are four major patents authorities that relevant to organic and perovskite solar cells. The European Patent Office (EPO), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) become the main tools for emerging solar cells analysis. In total, 5027 patents related to organic solar cell and 1764 patents related to perovskite solar cell were analyzed and then sorted in thematic subcategories. The analysis shows that inventors make highest impact in solar cells manufacturing areas and highlights the last years leaps in the field."
223,223,10.1021/acsami.8b14224,,,Impact of ZnO Photoluminescence on Organic Photovoltaic Performance,2018,"ZnO is a widely used electron transport material in third generation solar cells. Intrinsic defects arising from different synthetic methods and conditions lead to different fluorescent colors. The defect mechanisms have been explored in the literature, but their impact on organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell performance is rarely reported. Herein, three different ZnO nanoparticles showing blue, green, and yellow emission colors are synthesized and incorporated into OPV cells. The as-cast ZnO films result in vastly different OPV performances. It is found the sodium acetate as the byproduct of the synthesis can significantly influence the interfacial contact. After removing the impurity via rinsing with polar organic solvents, the different ZnO nanoparticles can deliver similar power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in three representative OPV systems. The PCEs reached 4, 8, and 10% in P3HT:PC61BM-, PTB7-Th:PC71BM-, and PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F-based OPV cells, respectively. A series of characterizations indicate that the intrinsic defect types do not affect the optical and electrical properties of the ZnO film, including photon transmittance, electrical conductivity, and charge extraction from the active layer as well as electron mobility. The results together suggest that the intrinsic defect in ZnO nanoparticles has little impact on OPV performance. Thus, it might be necessary to revisit the strategies for defect engineering or passivation in oxide-based interfacial materials."
224,224,10.1016/j.orgel.2018.08.045,,,Strategic fluorination of polymers and fullerenes improves photostability of organic photovoltaic blends,2018,"The photobleaching dynamics of a series of three organic photovoltaic (OPV) donor polymer blends with five different fullerenes are presented. The fullerenes studied include PC60BM and four perfluoroalkylfullerenes with relatively large electron affinities, namely C-60(CF3)(2), C-60(i-C3F7)(2), C-60(CF3)4(,) and C-60(CF3)(8). The donor polymers were all based on cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) and thienopyrrolodione (TPD), but the TPD side chains were designed to include alkyl, partially fluorinated alkyl, and fluorinated phenyl groups to improve miscibility of the active layer components. Exciton harvesting was probed with photoluminescence quenching measurements. Accelerated photodegradation studies of polymer:fullerene blends were then carried out under white light illumination at similar to 1.2 suns in air. A strong correlation was observed between the polymer donor photobleaching rate and the electron affinity of the fullerene. The most dramatic effect was observed for a blend of C-60(CF3)(8) with the donor containing fluorinated phenyl groups: the blend required 150 times the dosing of photons to bleach to 80% of its initial optical density than an analagous blend of PC60BM and non-fluorinated donor polymer. These results ultimately suggest that appropriate fluorination strategies applied to both the donor and acceptor can be a viable route toward a new paradigm of intrinsically photo- and phase-stable OPV active layers."
225,225,10.1016/j.ijid.2018.08.017,,,Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in the Russian Federation in 1998–2014,2018,"OBJECTIVES
Different polio vaccination schemes have been used in Russia: oral polio vaccine (OPV) was used in 1998-2007 and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) followed by OPV in 2008-2014. This article presents the characteristics of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) cases in Russia during this period.


METHODS
VAPP cases were identified through the acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system, classified by the National Expert Classification Committee. Criteria for a 'recipient VAPP' (rVAPP) case were poliomyelitis symptoms 6-30days after OPV administration, isolation of the vaccine virus, and residual paralysis 60days after disease onset. Unvaccinated cases with a similar picture 6-60days after contact with an OPV recipient were classified as 'contact VAPP' (cVAPP) cases.


RESULTS
During 1998-2014, 127 VAPP cases were registered: 82 rVAPP and 45 cVAPP. During the period in which only OPV was used, rVAPP cases prevailed (73.8%); cases of rVAPP were reduced during the sequential scheme period (15%). Poliovirus type 3 (39.5%) and type 2 (23.7%) were isolated more often. Vaccine-derived poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were isolated from three cases of cVAPP. The incidence of VAPP cases was higher during the period of OPV use (1 case/1.59 million OPV doses) than during the sequential scheme period (1 case/4.18 million doses).


CONCLUSION
The risk of VAPP exists if OPV remains in the vaccination schedule."
226,226,10.1093/cid/ciy635,,,Pediatric HIV Infection and Decreased Prevalence of OPV Point Mutations Linked to Vaccine-associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis,2018,"Abstract Background Mutations associated with prolonged replication of the attenuated polioviruses found in oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) can lead to vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) and cause paralysis indistinguishable from that caused by wild poliovirus. In response, the World Health Organization has initiated the transition to exclusive use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), with OPV administration in cases of outbreak. However, it is currently unclear how IPV-only vaccination, well known to provide humoral but not mucosal immunity, will impact the development of paralysis causing OPV variants. Children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been documented to show decreased mucosal immunity following OPV vaccination. Thus, HIV-infected children vaccinated with OPV may serve as proxy for children with IPV-only vaccination. Methods We conducted a prospective study of Zimbabwean infants receiving OPV as part of their routine vaccination schedule. Stool samples collected from OPV-vaccinated children serially until age 24 months were tested for OPV serotypes using a real-time polymerase chain reaction protocol that quantifies the amount of mutant OPV variants found in each sample. Results Out of 2130 stool samples collected from 402 infants 365 stool samples were OPV positive: 313 from 212 HIV-noninfected (HIV−) infants and 52 from 34 HIV-infected (HIV+) infants. HIV− infants showed significantly higher proportions of OPV mutants when compared to HIV+ infants. Conclusions HIV infection is associated with a reduced proportion of OPV vaccine associated paralytic polio mutants. These results suggest that OPV administered to individuals previously vaccinated only with IPV will show decreased propensity for OPV mutations."
227,227,10.1093/cid/ciy639,,,"Validation of a High-throughput, Multiplex, Real-time Qualitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for the Detection of Sabin Oral Polio Vaccine in Environmental Samples",2018,"Abstract Background Currently, the primary mechanism for poliovirus detection is acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, with environmental sampling serving as a complement. However, as AFP cases drop, environmental surveillance will become increasingly critical for poliovirus detection. Mexico provides a natural environment to study oral polio vaccine (OPV) transmission, as it provides routine injected polio vaccine immunization and biannual OPV campaigns in February and May. Methods As part of a study of OPV transmission in which 155 children were vaccinated with OPV, monthly sewage samples were collected from rivers leading from 3 indigenous Mexican villages (Capoluca, Campo Grande, and Tuxpanguillo) from February to May 2015. Samples were also collected from October 2015 to October 2017, during which time there were standard OPV campaigns. Samples were analyzed for the presence of OPV serotypes, using a real-time qualitative polymerase chain reaction assay capable of detecting as few as 9, 12, and 10 copies/100 µL of viral ribonucleic acid for OPV serotypes 1, 2, and 3 (OPV-1, -2, and -3), respectively. Included here are 54 samples, taken up to November 2016. Results Of the 54 samples, 13 (24%) were positive for OPV. After the vaccination of 155 children in February 2015, OPV was found 2 months after vaccination. After unrestricted OPV administration in February 2016, OPV was detected in sewage up to 8 months after vaccination. OPV-3 was found in 11 of the 13 positive samples (85%), OPV-2 was found in 3 positive samples (23%), and OPV-1 was found in 1 sample (8%). Conclusions OPV can be detected even when small amounts of the vaccine are introduced into a community, as shown by OPV-positive sewage samples even when only 155 children were vaccinated. When OPV vaccination was unrestricted, sewage samples were positive up to 8 months after vaccination, implying community OPV circulation for at least 8 months. OPV-3 was the serotype most found in these samples, indicating prolonged transmission of OPV-3 when compared to the other serotypes. Future work could compare the phylogenetic variance of OPV isolates from sewage after OPV vaccinations."
228,228,10.1093/cid/ciy650,,,Characterization of Household and Community Shedding and Transmission of Oral Polio Vaccine in Mexican Communities with Varying Vaccination Coverage,2018,"Abstract Background The World Health Assembly 2012 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan calls for the eventual cessation of all oral polio vaccines (OPVs), to be replaced with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV); however, IPV induces less robust mucosal immunity than OPV. This study characterized household and community OPV shedding and transmission after OPV vaccination within primarily IPV-vaccinated communities. Methods Households in 3 IPV-vaccinated Mexican communities were randomized to receive 3 levels of OPV vaccination coverage (70%, 30%, or 10%). Ten stool samples were collected from all household members over 71 days. Analysis compared vaccinated subjects, household contacts of vaccinated subjects, and subjects in unvaccinated households. Logistic and Cox regression models were fitted to characterize transmission of OPV by coverage and household vaccination status. Results Among 148 vaccinated children, 380 household contacts, and 1124 unvaccinated community contacts, 78%, 18%, and 7%, respectively, shed OPV. Community and household contacts showed no differences in transmission (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], .37–1.20), in shedding trajectory (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, .35–1.07), or in time to shedding (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, .39–1.19). Transmission began as quickly as 1 day after vaccination and persisted as long as 71 days after vaccination. Transmission within unvaccinated households differed significantly across vaccination coverage communities, with the 70% community experiencing the most transmissions (15%), and the 10% community experiencing the least (4%). These trends persisted over time and in the time to first shedding analyses. Conclusions Transmission did not differ between household contacts of vaccinees and unvaccinated households. Understanding poliovirus transmission dynamics is important for postcertification control."

We aimed to quantify the transmission potential of Sabin strains from OPV when it is reintroduced, accidentally or deliberately, in a community vaccinated with inactivated poliovirus vaccine alone. Methods We built an individual-based stochastic epidemiological model that allows independent spread of 3 Sabin serotypes and differential transmission rates within versus between households. Model parameters were estimated by fitting to data from a prospective cohort in Mexico. We calculated the effective reproductive number for the Mexico cohort and simulated scenarios of Sabin strain resurgence under postcessation conditions, projecting the risk of prolonged circulation, which could lead to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Results The estimated effective reproductive number for naturally infected individuals was about 1 for Sabin 2 and Sabin 3 (OPV2 and OPV3) in a postcessation setting. Most transmission events occurred between households. We estimated the probability of circulation for >9 months to be (1) <<1% for all 3 serotypes when 90% of children <5 years of age were vaccinated in a hypothetical outbreak control campaign; (2) 45% and 24% for Sabin 2 and Sabin 3, respectively, when vaccine coverage dropped to 10%; (3) 37% and 8% for Sabin 2 and Sabin 3, respectively, when a single active shedder appeared in a community. Conclusions Critical factors determining the risk of cVDPV emergence are the scale at which OPV is reintroduced and the between-household transmission rate for poliovirus, with intermediate values posing the greatest risk."

Previous assays used for detection of Sabin oral polio vaccine (OPV) in fecal samples have been labor and time intensive and vary in their sensitivity and specificity. Methods We developed a high-throughput, multiplex reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay able to detect all 3 OPV strains in fecal samples. The assay used a KingFisher Duo Prime system for viral RNA isolation and extraction. Positive samples were retested and Sanger sequenced for verification of Sabin serotype identity. Results The 95% lower limit of detection was determined to be 3 copies per reaction for Sabin 1 and 3 and 4 copies per reaction for Sabin 2, with no cross-reactivity between the 3 serotypes and their primers. A total of 554 samples (3.6%) were positive, with 304 positive samples (54.9%) containing >1 serotype. Of the positive samples, 476 (85.9%) contained enough RNA to be sequenced, and of these all sequences were Sabin serotypes. The previous assay we used could process 48 samples in a 10-hour period, whereas the new assay processed >100 samples in 6 hours. Conclusions The new high-throughput, multiplex reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay allowed for sensitive and specific detection of OPV serotypes while greatly decreasing sample handling and processing time. We were able to sequence 72.4% of the 210 positive samples in the cycle threshold range of 35–37."

Specifically, we focus on hole-transfer kinetics from the photoexcited NFA thiophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-thiophene-3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (4TIC) to the conjugated polymer donor poly[(4,4′-bis(2-butyloctoxycarbonyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5-diyl)-alt-(2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl)] (PDCBT) using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy by selectively exciting the 4TIC electron acceptor and monitoring the bleach of the PDCBT ground-state population. In the blend, the 4TIC excitons decay with an average lifetime of 7 ps, accompanied by a concomitant rise in the ground-state bleach of the polymer with a comparable average lifetime that is 60% complete by 8 ps and 95% complete by 100 ps, occurring roughly an order of magnitude slower than that in most previously reported polymer/NFA blends.

Here we present the extended genomic characterization of OPV Abatino, a novel OPV isolated in Italy from an infected Tonkean macaque, with zoonotic potential. Phylogenetic analysis based on 102 conserved OPV genes (core gene set) showed that OPV Abatino is most closely related to the Ectromelia virus species (ECTV), although placed on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, bringing substantial support to the hypothesis that this strain may be part of a novel OPV clade. Extending the analysis to the entire set of genes (coding sequences, CDS) further substantiated this hypothesis. In fact the genome of OPV Abatino included more CDS than ECTV; most of the extra genes (mainly located in the terminal genome regions), showed the highest similarity with cowpox virus (CPXV); however vaccinia virus (VACV) and monkeypox virus (MPXV) were the closest OPV for certain CDS. These findings suggest that OPV Abatino could be the result of complex evolutionary events, diverging from any other previously described OPV, and may indicate that previously reported cases in Italy could represent the tip of the iceberg yet to be explored."

Charging of smart phones using OPV modules is a prime application area. However, the chargers developed using organic PV modules are bulky as they require carrying long rolls of PV arrays. This paper proposes an integrated charger for smart phones, which includes an OPV module and a charging circuit with an op-amp based precision diode. The proposed charger uses an OPV module of size equal to that of the smart phone display. The proposed design reduces the size and weight of charger significantly. The experimental results of OPV module characterization, battery characteristics, blocking diode performance, and increase in state of charge (SOC) of the smart phone using proposed charger are presented."
234,234,10.1039/c8ee01559g,,,Measuring the competition between bimolecular charge recombination and charge transport in organic solar cells under operating conditions,2018,"The rational design of new high performance materials for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications is largely inhibited by a lack of design rules for materials that have slow bimolecular charge recombination. Due to the complex device physics present in OPVs, rigorous and reliable measurement techniques for charge transport and charge recombination are needed to construct improved physical models that can guide materials development and discovery. Here, we develop a new technique called impedance-photocurrent device analysis (IPDA) to quantitatively characterize the competition between charge extraction and charge recombination under steady state operational conditions. The measurements are performed on actual lab scale solar cells, have mild equipment requirements, and can be integrated into normal device fabrication and testing workflows. We perform IPDA tests on a broad set of devices with varying polymer:fullerene blend chemistry and processing conditions. Results from the IPDA technique exhibit significantly improved reliability and self-consistency compared to the open-circuit voltage decay technique (OCVD). IPDA measurements also reveal a significant negative electric field dependence of the bimolecular recombination coefficient in high fill factor devices, a finding which is inaccessible to most other common techniques and indicates that many of these techniques may overestimate the value that is most relevant for describing device performance. Future work utilizing IPDA to build structure–property relationships for bimolecular recombination will lead to enhanced design rules for creating efficient OPVs that are suitable for commercialization."

Commercially available flexible OPV modules with a size of 10 cm × 14 cm were used. Colloidal silica spheres with diameters ranging from 50 nm to 740 nm were used for the photonic crystal fabrication. The photonic structures made from SiO2 spheres with diameters of 50 nm and 120 nm demonstrate good antireflective properties in the visible and near-infrared spectral range, which have a pronounced positive effect on the photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency in OPV modules at all angles of the light incidence. The 2D photonic crystals made from SiO2 spheres with diameters of 600 nm and 740 nm show strong diffractive scattering of incident light in the forward direction, which results in significant light trapping effects in the OPV modules which again gives rise to an improvement in the cell characteristics. The observed light trapping effects vary only slightly with angle of incidence, suggesting that such photonic crystal layers could be of direct benefit in terms of the response of the OPV modules without the need to track the sun position as it moves across the sky."

The UV–vis absorption spectra of PBDPOx-biT, PQcOx-TT (linear shaped polymer) films were red-shifted compared with the solution absorption, whereas that of a PBDPOx-TT, PQcOx-biT (curve shaped polymer) film was blue-shifted. PBDPOx-biT, PQcOx-TT had high crystallinity. Linear polymers prefer regular and crystalline domains in the film state and lead to more efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. PQcOx-TT possesses a PCE value of up to 3.4%."
237,237,10.1021/acsami.8b11378,,,Multiphoton Microscopy of π-Conjugated Copolymers and Copolymer/Fullerene Blends for Organic Photovoltaic Applications,2018,"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells based on π-conjugated copolymer/fullerene blends are devices with the highest power conversion efficiencies within the class of organic semiconductors. Although a number of image microscopies have been applied to films of π-conjugated copolymers and their fullerene blends, seldom have they been able to detect microscopic defects in the blend films. We have applied multiphoton microscopy (MPM) using a 65 fs laser at 1.56 μm for spectroscopy and mapping of films of various π-conjugated copolymers and their fullerene blends. All pristine copolymer films have shown third harmonic generation (THG) and two-photon or three-photon photoluminescence that could be used for mapping the films with micrometer spatial resolution. Since the fullerenes have much weaker THG efficiency than those of the copolymers, we could readily map the copolymer/fullerene blend films that showed interpenetrating micron-sized grains of the two constituents. In addition, we also found second harmonic generation from various micron-sized defects in the films that are formed during film deposition or light illumination at ambient conditions, which do not possess inversion symmetry. The MPM method is therefore beneficial for organic films and devices for investigating the properties and growth of copolymer/fullerene blends for OPV applications."

Methods In this Phase III, multicenter, open label, randomized, controlled study, three doses of BRV-PV or two doses of Rotarix® and one dose of placebo were given to healthy infants at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Subjects also received three doses of DTwP-HepB-Hib (diphtheria, tetanus, whole-cell pertussis, hepatitis B, and haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate – pentavalent vaccine) and oral polio vaccine concomitantly at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age and a single dose of inactivated polio vaccine at 14 weeks of age. Blood samples were collected four weeks after the final vaccination to assess immune responses to all the vaccines administered. For diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Hib, polio type 1, and polio type 3 antibodies, non-interference was to be supported if the lower limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the seroprotection rate difference for the BRV-PV group minus the Rotarix® group was >10.0%. For pertussis antibodies, non-interference was to be supported if the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the ratio of geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) was >0.5. Results A total of 1500 infants were randomized to either BRV-PV (1125 infants) or Rotarix® (375 infants), of which 1341 completed the study as per the protocol. More than 97% of subjects achieved seroprotective antibody titres against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Hib, polio type 1, and polio type 3 in both groups. The difference in seroprotection rates between the BRV-PV group and the Rotarix® group for all these antibodies was less than 1%. The ratio of GMCs of anti-pertussis IgG concentrations for the BRV-PV group versus Rotarix® was 1.04 [90% CI: 0.90; 1.19]. Conclusion BRV-PV does not interfere with the immunogenicity of concomitantly administered routine infants vaccines."

Results of a seroprevalence survey in Florence, Italy",2018,"ABSTRACT Objectives: Periodical assessments of population susceptibility to polioviruses (PV) is essential for evaluating population protection and planning appropriate vaccination strategies. The aim of the current work was to assess serological protective titers against all three polioviruses in the general population of Florence. Methods: A convenience sample of 328 sera, collected in 2009 in Florence (Central Italy) was analyzed. Samples were considered protective if neutralizing antibodies were detected at dilutions ≥1:8, according to the WHO protocols. Results: The immune coverage was 75.3%, 69.2% and 46% for PV1, PV2 and PV3, respectively. The protective titers of neutralizing antibodies were generally higher in children up to 14 years of age, with 74.4% (PV1), 75.6% (PV2) and 56.7% (PV3) of seroprevalence. From the age of 11 years, most of the study subjects were seronegative for PV3. Conclusions: In a polio-free country with strong migration pressures, such as Italy, our results bring clear support to the recent recommendation of Italian health authorities to introduce a fifth dose of IPV vaccine in adolescence all over the country."

In this respect, polyethylene furanoate (PEF), one of the bio-based polyesters, thus reveals a great potential to replace the commonly used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on account of its better mechanical, gas barrier, and thermal properties. Herein, a bio-based, flexible, conductive film is successfully developed by coupling a PEF plastic substrate with silver nanowires (Ag NWs). Besides the appealing advantage of renewable biomass, PEF also exhibits a good transparency around 90% in the visible wavelength range, and its constituent polar furan moiety is revealed to enable an intense interaction with Ag NWs to largely enhance the adhesion of Ag NWs grown above, as exemplified by the superior bending and peeling durability than the currently prevailing PET substrate.

In this paper, a new testing methodology whereby multiple stresses are applied simultaneously using a “design of experiment (DOE) approach” is reported and used for predictive aging of modules. Multistress data are used for predictive aging of OPV modules under different stress levels; a general log-linear life model has been adapted and applied in order to predict the life of OPV modules and this is compared to experimental data, which show that a close estimation of simulated lifetime is obtained (within 18% accuracy). The life test models can be used for predicting aging of OPV modules in different geographic locations and could be used to account for different degradation rates due to seasonal climatic variations. Furthermore, by using the DOE data, we show how the major stress factors can be screened and their statistical significance upon degradation quantified using analysis of variance. One of the potential benefits of using this approach for OPV degradation studies is that additional factors could be added to study the impact on degradation to provide a more comprehensive study."

The 2013 reemergence of wild poliovirus in Israel led to the reinstatement of a routine OPV vaccination. Fearing VAPP in immunocompromised, the MOH regulated contraindications for vaccination candidates and household contacts. In this study we estimate the size of the contraindicated population to OPV vaccination.


METHOD
We studied vaccination candidates aged 2-9 and 14-23 months and probable household contacts. Using the rate of contraindications extracted for each study group from a medical records database, a statistical model was built to estimate the probability of contraindications in candidates.


RESULTS
3.9% of the 2-9-month-old study group and 4% of the 14-23-month-old group had contraindications by either self or household contacts.


CONCLUSION
A statistical model can provide an estimation of the contraindicated population and can be used in the future when devising vaccination campaigns. In contrast to concerns raised by the MOH, our findings show a smaller than anticipated contraindicated population."

The materials used are selected so as to allow P–N junction creation. Deposition technique allows at simultaneous applying the materials leads to obtaining homogeneous dispersion of one material in the other, which determines the formation of bulk P–N junctions. Research includes the estimate of share of individual components in the active layer, then determination of the morphology of surface and optical properties of the same layer and its implementation in photovoltaic structures. The structural researches and morphology of surface investigation were made using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The optical properties were researched with the use of UV–Visible spectroscope. The parameters of cells have been determined on the basis of current–voltage characteristics.

ZnO films are based on a zinc acetate dihydrate and prepared via annealing in air or argon which performance shows a clear dependence on ZnO formation. We investigated chemical component and crystal structure of ZnO through XPS and XRD. The oxygen contributed ZnO enhances the self-assembly between amine of polyethylenimine (PEI) and hydroxyls, which induces smoothness of ZnO/PEI interface. As a result, PCE with optimized ZnO/PEI exhibited 8.83%, compared to in argon (4.67%). Moreover, oxygen-contributed ZnO/PEI cells lead to air stability with 80% sustained efficiency during the 500 hours."
259,259,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b01600,,,Absence of Mixed Phase in Organic Photovoltaic Active Layers Facilitates Use of Green Solvent Processing,2018,"We examine the morphology of a donor molecule:fullerene organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layer, processed from the “green solvent” 2-methyl-THF (m-THF), as well as the conformation of the two OPV constituent components in the casting solution. We observe that the small molecule (X2) has a weak association with itself in chloroform solvent, whereas it does not self-associate in m-THF. Despite this difference, the morphologies of the final processed films are extraordinarily similar: there is negligible molecularly mixed phase in the layer, and the domain sizes of the pure X2 and pure fullerene are 15–20 nm. We attribute this similarity between the final films to the strong aggregation behavior of X2 upon drying; changes in solvent or solvent additive have therefore only a minor effect on the final bulk heterojunction morphology. This contrasts with the majority of other OPV molecular donor semiconductor systems, which need careful tuning of solvent and/or solvent additive to achieve the optimal morphology..."

The particles have a broad size distribution with diameters between 30 and 680 nm and well-developed crystal habits. The nanoplates were successfully incorporated into organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells as hole conduction materials. The power conversion efficiency of OPV cells fabricated with the nanoplates is 16% higher than that of a control device fabricated without the nanoplates.

Despite the recent fast progress in materials informatics and data science, data-driven molecular design of OPV materials remains challenging. We report a screening of conjugated molecules for polymer-fullerene OPV applications by supervised learning methods (artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF)). Approximately 1000 experimental parameters including PCE, molecular weight, and electronic properties are manually collected from the literature and subjected to machine learning with digitized chemical structures. Contrary to the low correlation coefficient in ANN, RF yields an acceptable accuracy, which is twice that of random classification. We demonstrate the application of RF screening for the design, synthesis, and characterization of a conjugated polymer, which facilitates a rapid development of optoelectronic materials."

In this work, we have varied the group 14 atom (C, Si, Ge) at the center of a bithiophene fused ring to elucidate the impact of a minimal repeat unit structure change on the optical, transport, and morphological properties, which ultimately control device performance. Careful polymerization and polymer purification produced three “one-atom change” donor–acceptor conjugated alternating copolymers with similar molecular weights and dispersities.

Blending them with compatible electron-donating (donor or p-type) polymers yields an OPV device known as bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Compared to the more extensively studied OPVs using fullerene derivatives as the acceptor material, all-PSCs provide important benefits such as chemical tunability, mechanical flexibility and ambient/stress stability. Through an extensive research on materials design and device optimization in the last five years, all-PSCs employing NDI-based polymers have achieved remarkable improvement in device power conversion efficiency (PCE), now surpassing 10% – a number that approaches the state-of-the-art organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells using fullerenes. In this review, recent development of NDI-based conjugated polymers used in all-PSCs will be highlighted."
265,265,10.1016/j.solmat.2018.01.011,,,Electrode de-wetting as a failure mechanism in thermally-aged OPV devices,2018,"Abstract Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells are a promising solar energy technology that could greatly increase the number of ways that solar cells can be utilised. Many of these applications involve the use of thin silver electrodes, however little attention has been paid to the role that electrode thickness plays in the operational stability of the device. This study found that inverted OPV devices with thin silver electrodes exhibited a catastrophic failure with only modest amounts of thermal ageing – primarily driven by substantial increases in the series resistance and decreases in the fill factor of the devices. Subsequent analysis by atomic force microscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry showed that as the devices aged, gaps in thin silver electrodes appeared, showing that the electrode was de-wetting from the device, which would explain the rise in series resistance. This represents an intrinsic vulnerability in inverted OPV devices that can avoided if the silver electrode is sufficiently thick (> 60 nm). This problem can be overcome with the addition of a thin metal-oxide layer on top of the electrode which greatly slowed the electrode de-wetting with little variation in device performance – representing a potential solution for applications where a thin silver electrode is required."

267,267,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2018.01.036,,,Electrical-thermal-mechanical properties of multifunctional OPV-ETFE foils for large-span transparent membrane buildings,2018,"Abstract ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) foils integrated organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the achievement of sustainability. As building materials, multifunctional OPV-ETFE foils could produce electricity, store thermal energy and possess structural capability. In this case, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties coexist and influence each other due to photovoltaic/thermal effects. Understanding the fundamental mechanism is significant to analyze and design corresponding structures. This paper concerns coupled properties of OPV-ETFE specimens with controlled experiments. One-parameter and two-parameter analysis of two typical specimens are performed to investigate essential properties. Experimental observations show that within normal working conditions, electrical properties are relatively independent but that thermal-mechanical properties are related to each other. Yield stress, yield strain and elastic modulus are calculated from stress-strain curves; these mechanical properties are comparable with those of original ETFE foils at the same temperature. It is concluded from temperature-stress curves that yield point has a critical effect on temperature-stress correlation and that mechanical properties of double OPV specimens are better than those of single OPV specimens. Generally, these mechanical properties could provide basic insights into evaluation of energetic performance and structural behavior of transparent membrane buildings."
268,268,10.1021/acsami.7b19442,,,Influence of Environmentally Affected Hole-Transport Layers on Spatial Homogeneity and Charge-Transport Dynamics of Organic Solar Cells,2018,"After organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells achieved efficiency of more than 10%, the control of stability and degradation mechanisms of solar cells became a prominent task. The increase of device efficiency due to incorporation of a hole-transport layer (HTL) in bulk-heterojunction solar cells has been extensively reported. However, the most widely used HTL material, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is frequently suspected to be the dominating source for device instability under environmental conditions. Thereby, effects like photooxidation and electrode corrosion are often reported to shorten device lifetime. However, often in environmental device studies, the source of degradation, whether being from the HTL, the active layer, or the metal cathode is rather difficult to distinguish because the external diffusion of oxygen and water affects all components. In this study, different HTLs, namely, those prepared from traditional PEDOT:PSS and also two types of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) are exposed to different environments, such as oxygen, light, or humidity, prior to device finalization under inert conditions. This allows investigating any effects within the HTL and from reactions at its interface to the indium tin oxide electrode or the active layer. The surface and bulk chemistry of the exposed HTL has been monitored and discussed in context to the observed device physics, dynamic charge transport, and spatial performance homogeneity of the corresponding OPV device. The results show that merely humidity exposure of the HTL leads to decreased device performance for PEDOT:PSS, but also for one type of the tested MoO3. The losses are related to the amount of absorbed water in the HTL, inducing loss of active area in terms of interfacial contact. The device with PEDOT:PSS HTL after humid air exposure showed seriously decreased photocurrent by microdelamination of swelling/shrinkage of the hygroscopic layer. The colloidal MoO3 with water-based precursor solution presents slight decay of solar cell performance, also here caused by swelling/shrinking reaction, but by a combination of in-plane particle contact and resistance scaling with particle expansion. However, the device with quasi-continuous and alcohol-based MoO3 showed unharmed stable electrical performance."
269,269,10.1021/acsami.8b00975,,,Spontaneous Interfacial Dipole Orientation Effect of Acetic Acid Solubilized PFN,2018,"Poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)- alt-(9,9-bis(3'-( N, N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN) is a very important interfacial modifier in organic photovoltaic and organic light-emitting diodes to improve device performance, where their molecular dipole has been regarded to play a key role. In this work, we have reported a spontaneous interfacial dipole orientation effect in acetic acid dissolved PFN, which is strongly related to the interfacial dipole and the corresponding device performance. In direct spin-coating, the interfacial dipole is 1.08 Debye with interfacial contact angle 84.8°, whereas after self-assembly of 10 min, the interfacial dipole is balanced at 4.21 Debye, with the interfacial contact angle decreasing to 76.8°. Without strong interaction with the substrate, the energy of upward amine groups is much lower than that of downward ones in theoretical simulation, which would be the driving force of this spontaneous process. The preferred conformations of PFN molecules on hydroxylated substrates have over 99% amine groups outward, and the theoretical average dipole calculated from the weight of these conformations is 4.48 Debye, which is close to the experimental result and indicates a high ratio of upward amine groups in self-assembled films. This effect obviously changes the device performance, such as an obvious positive threshold voltage shift in transistors and a distinct increase of the short-circuit current/open-circuit voltage in organic solar cells. This effect provides a deeper understanding of the PFN interlayer mechanism and has potential application in optoelectronic devices."

We have previously reported that each Cl–ClnBsubNc sample is a mixed alloyed composition, wherein each has a varying degree of bay-position chlorination. We have determined that increasing bay chlorination has a beneficial effect on the fill factor of PHJs. Comparison between this new and our past OPV data sets, which utilized the same set of Cl–ClnBsubNcs as electron acceptors and transporters, reveals that the increase of fill factor and performance is likely due to improved exciton transport and higher levels of bay-position chlorination. While we identify two possible mechanisms for this, further studies will be required to determine whether the phenomenon is driven by decreased radiative relaxation or due to enhanced thermal hopping from ..."
271,271,10.3390/v10040142,,,Rapid viral diagnosis of orthopoxviruses by electron microscopy: Optional or a must?,2018,"Diagnostic electron microscopy (DEM) was an essential component of viral diagnosis until the development of highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT). The simple negative staining technique of DEM was applied widely to smallpox diagnosis until the world-wide eradication of the human-specific pathogen in 1980. Since then, the threat of smallpox re-emerging through laboratory escape, molecular manipulation, synthetic biology or bioterrorism has not totally disappeared and would be a major problem in an unvaccinated population. Other animal poxviruses may also emerge as human pathogens. With its rapid results (only a few minutes after arrival of the specimen), no requirement for specific reagents and its “open view”, DEM remains an important component of virus diagnosis, particularly because it can easily and reliably distinguish smallpox virus or any other member of the orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus from parapoxviruses (PPV) and the far more common and less serious herpesviruses (herpes simplex and varicella zoster). Preparation, enrichment, examination, internal standards and suitable organisations are discussed to make clear its continuing value as a diagnostic technique."
272,272,10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.035,,,Mass media effect on vaccines uptake during silent polio outbreak,2018,"BACKGROUND
During 2013, isolation of a wild type 1 poliovirus from routine sewage sample in Israel, led to a national OPV campaign. During this period, there was a constant cover of the outbreak by the mass media.


AIMS
To investigate the association of media exposure and OPV and non-OPV vaccines uptake during the 2013 silent polio outbreak in Israel.


METHODS
We received data on daily immunization rates during the outbreak period from the Ministry of Health (MoH). We conducted a multivariable time trend analysis to assess the association between daily media exposure and vaccines uptake. Analysis was stratified by ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES).


RESULTS
During the MoH supplemental immunization activity, 138,799 OPV vaccines were given. There was a significant association between media exposure and OPV uptake, most prominent in a lag of 3-5 days from the exposure among Jews (R.R 1.79C.I 95% 1.32-2.41) and high SES subgroups (R.R 1.71C.I 95% 1.27-2.30). These subgroups also showed increased non-OPV uptake in a lag of 3-5 days from the media exposure, in all vaccines except for MMR. Lower SES and non-Jewish subgroups did not demonstrate the same association.


CONCLUSION
Our findings expand the understanding of public behaviour during outbreaks. The public response shows high variability within specific subgroups. These findings highlight the importance of tailored communication strategies for each subgroup."

To help achieve this goal, the WHO developed GAPIII, a global guideline implemented at the national level to minimize the risk of facility-associated poliovirus infections. The guidelines require research facilities to either destroy or contain wild type, vaccine-derived poliovirus; oral poliovirus vaccine viruses; and potentially infectious poliovirus materials for an area where polio was found or oral polio vaccine was in use. These requirements are applicable to facilities that conduct research unrelated to poliovirus but intend to use samples that may contain potentially infectious materials, such as infant stool specimens. In this case study, we demonstrate our approach to comply with the GAPIII guidelines, identify opportunities to improve the guidelines for international public health research, and provide recommendations for biosafety officers to help research facilities comply with changing global guidelines such as poliovirus containment."

Here, spray coating has been employed as an easy and versatile scalable technique to deposit all the layers of flexible polymer solar cells starting from PET/ITO/Ag/ITO substrates. A foldable nanocomposite based on cellulose and sprayed graphene nanoplatelets has been applied as top electrode through lamination. The overall fabrication process has been conducted in air by using commercial materials. A significant power conversion efficiency higher than 3% has been achieved and the high quality of the lamination process has been demonstrated by bending and adhesion tests.

277,277,10.1016/j.orgel.2017.12.047,,,Experimental investigation of tensile mechanical strain influence on the dark current of organic solar cells,2018,"Abstract In this paper we have experimentally studied the electrical behavior of organic solar cells (OSCs) under mechanical strain in dark condition. Dark current-voltage characteristics of solar cells provide valuable information on the defect states inside the device. The samples under tests here are two commercial polymeric solar cells with different electrode types. So, instead of studying merely the dark current changes of the solar cells versus strain, the electrodes effects due to the applied strain are compared at different environment temperatures. The most important electrical parameters of the strained cells are extracted as a function of the strain at different temperatures for two conditions: when the cells are under strain and when they are relaxed for 3 min after applying the strain. The only parameter that shows a considerable meaningful change by strain is the series resistance. The final results confirm that the cell with silver electrodes, shows a current increase by tensile strain due to the polymeric chains alignment along the strain direction. But the cell with carbon electrodes experiences a current decrement by increasing the strain. We believe that the carbon electrode, due to the larger carbon Young's modulus, in comparison with the silver electrode cells creates more defect states in the flexible polymeric cells under the same amount of the applied strain. Furthermore, the cell with softer and more stretchable silver grid electrodes can withstand a higher level of strain before suffering any permanent damage."
278,278,10.1016/j.solmat.2017.10.028,,,Analysing impact of oxygen and water exposure on roll-coated organic solar cell performance using impedance spectroscopy,2018,"In this work we study the degradation of roll-coated flexible inverted organic solar cells with the device architecture Ag/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/FSP1:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag in different atmospheres. We demonstrate that impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool for elucidating degradation mechanisms; it is used here to distinguish the different degradation mechanisms due to water and oxygen. Identical cells were exposed to different accelerated degradation environments using water only, oxygen only, and both water and oxygen simultaneously, all of them enhanced with UV light. The photocurrent is dramatically reduced in the oxygen-degraded samples. Impedance measurements indicate that this phenomenon is attributed to defects introduced by absorption of oxygen, which results in an increase of the acceptor impurity (NA) at the cathode interface obtained from a Mott-Schottky analysis. Simultaneously, at the anode interface where PEDOT:PSS is not shielded by the substrate, the nature of degradation differs for the water and oxygen degraded samples. While oxygen + UV light decreases the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer, water + UV light changes the PEDOT:PSS work function inducing a depletion region at the anode."
279,279,10.1063/1.5017866,,,Understanding the free energy barrier and multiple timescale dynamics of charge separation in organic photovoltaic cells,2018,"By employing several lattice model systems, we investigate the free energy barrier and real-time dynamics of charge separation in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. It is found that the combined effects of the external electric field, entropy, and charge delocalization reduce the free energy barrier significantly. The dynamic disorder reduces charge carrier delocalization and results in the increased charge separation barrier, while the effect of static disorder is more complicated. Simulation of the real-time dynamics indicates that the free charge generation process involves multiple time scales, including an ultrafast component within hundreds of femtoseconds, an intermediate component related to the relaxation of the hot charge transfer (CT) state, and a slow component on the time scale of tens of picoseconds from the thermally equilibrated CT state. Effects of hot exciton dissociation as well as its dependence on the energy offset between the Frenkel exciton and the CT state are also analyzed. The current results indicate that only a small energy offset between the band gap and the lowest energy CT state is needed to achieve efficient free charge generation in OPV devices, which agrees with recent experimental findings."

However, the performance of OPV devices relies on the formation of a nanostructured morphology of small but well-defined domains of donor and acceptor materials. Covalent linkage of the donor and acceptor material into a single block copolymer material could provide a bottom-up approach to the formation of ideal morphologies, but fundamental and multidisciplinary research is required to overcome the limitations facing the successful application of this material class to OPV. In this review, the evolution of block copolymers as OPV active layers and the strategies of material design, morphology control, and synthesis are discussed. Donor/acceptor block copolymers designed as single material OPV active layers and studies of model systems which contribute to the understanding of donor/acceptor block copolymers are the focus. Coil–coil and rod–coil block copolymer systems are examined to inform the discussion on rod–rod type materials, while the synthesis and application of fully-conjugated block copolymers is emphasized as the foremost material design."

The purpose of the study was to determine the role of mothers’ attitude and subjective wellbeing on non-compliance to OPV supplemental immunization in Northern Nigeria.MethodsThe study utilized a cross-sectional design to assess attitude and subjective well-being of mothers using previously validated VACSATC (Vaccine Safety, Attitudes, Training and Communication-10 items) & SUBI (Subjective Well-being Inventory-40 items) measures. A total of 396 participants (equal number of non-compliant and compliant mothers) from 94 non-compliant settlements were interviewed, after informed consent. T-test was run to assess difference in mean scores between the non-compliant and compliant mothers on VACSATC and SUBI measures.ResultsThe research showed a significant difference in mean scores between the non-compliant and compliant groups on VACSATC measure of mothers’ attitude (M = 18.9 non-compliant, compared to 26.5 compliant; p < 0.05). On subjective well-being, the study showed there was no significant difference in the mean scores of the SUBI measure (M = 77.4 non-compliant, compared to 78.0 compliant; p > 0.05).ConclusionThe research has shown that negative attitude is more commonly present in non-compliant mothers and may be a factor in vaccine refusal in Northern Nigeria."

In this work, we have developed a series of novel poly(ionic liquid) nonconjugated block copolymers for improving the performance of inverted OPV cells by using them as work function modifiers of the indium tin oxide (ITO) cathode. Four nonconjugated polyelectrolytes (n-CPEs) based on polystyrene and imidazolium poly(ionic liquid) (PSImCl) were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The ratio of hydrophobic/hydrophilic block copolymers was varied depending on the ratio of polystyrene to the PSImCl block. The ionic density, which controls the work function of the electrode by forming an interfacial dipole between the electrode and the block copolymers, was easily tuned by simply changing the PSImCl molar ratio. The inverted OPV device with the ITO/PS29-b-PSImCl60 cathode achieved the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.55% among the synthesized block copolymers, exhibiting an even higher PCE than that of the reference OPV device with PEIE (7.30%).

285,285,10.1016/j.solmat.2017.10.008,,,"Outdoor organic photovoltaic module characteristics: Benchmarking against other PV technologies for performance, calculation of Ross coefficient and outdoor stability monitoring",2018,"Abstract A comparison of performance parameters for first, second and third generation PV technologies has been conducted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules displayed markedly different outdoor performance characteristics to other PV technologies owing to the positive temperature coefficient, lower thermal mass and response under low light conditions. The linear relationship between irradiance and module temperature rise above ambient is studied, leading to calculation of values for the Ross coefficient for OPV modules. OPVs are shown to possess a lower Ross coefficient than poly-Si, due to the lower absorption of infrared radiation. The effect of wind speed on the Ross coefficient is also investigated, showing the effect that module structure has upon outdoor PV performance, with the OPV module cooling quicker under windy conditions than the poly-Si due to a lower thermal mass. A long term stability study on OPV modules with a silver nanowire-zinc oxide (AgNW-ZnO) composite front electrode has showed two phases of degradation: a short initial burn-in with significant drops in performance; followed by stabilisation and degradation progressing at a much slower rate. During the burn-in period the modules showed diurnal reversible degradation in the short circuit current (ISC), whereas open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) show a steady decline. The reversible degradation is assumed to be related to the desorption of oxygen from the ZnO layer during the day due to UV excitation, leading to an increase in trap formation and a drop in current generation capacity, followed by re-adsorption of the oxygen overnight."

However, the modest PV performance obtained to date-in particular the low power conversion efficiency (PCE)-has impeded the large scale deployment of OPV cells. The low PCE in OPV solar cells is mainly attributed to the low carrier mobility, which is closely correlated to the transport diffusion length of the charge carriers within the photoactive layers. The 2D graphene material could be an excellent candidate for assisting charge transport improvement in the active layer of OPV cells, due to its huge carrier mobility, thermal and chemical stability, and its compatibility with the solution process. In this work, we report on the improvement of the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance of graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)-doped P3HT:PCBM photoactive blended layers, integrated into a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic-photovoltaic-based device, using PEDOT:PSS on an ITO/glass substrate. First, the light absorption capacity was observed to increase with respect to the GNP content, while the photoluminescence showed clear quenching, indicating electron transfer between the graphene sheets and the polymeric matrix. Then, the incorporation of GNP into the BHJ active layer resulted in enhanced PV performance with respect to the reference cell, and the best PV performance was obtained with 3 wt.% of GNP loading, with an open-circuit voltage of 1.24 V, a short-circuit current density value of 6.18 mA cm-2, a fill factor of 47.12%, and a power conversion efficiency of about 3.61%. We believe that the obtained results contribute to the development of organic photovoltaic devices and to the understanding of the impact of sp2-bonded carbon therein."

However, Organic Solar Cells (OSC) still suffer from lower efficiencies than their inorganic counterparts due to the narrow absorption band of single cell OSC. In this work, the performance of the several active materials available for OSCs has been analyzed in search of materials having complementary absorption band to obtain better light harvest and in turns efficient tandem OSC. For the performance analysis, an analytical model for the external voltage-dependent photocurrent in Bulk Heterojunction OSCs has been used, which incorporates exponential photon absorption, dissociation efficiency of bound electron-hole pairs (EHPs), carrier trapping, and carrier drift and diffusion in the photon absorption layer. Considering current matching, the optimized thickness of the individual cells has been obtained to design better performing double and triple-cell tandem OSCs. An efficiency of 8.29% has been obtained from a double-cell (junction) OSC by series connecting P3HT:PCBM (front cell) and pBBTDPP2:PCBM (back cell). A completely new low-bandgap (1.59 eV) material has been introduced as a middle cell to design a triple-junction(cell) tandem OSC which provided a PCE of about 14%, which is a great enhancement in PCE."

With the incorporation of diverse metallic nanostructures in active layers, buffer layers, electrodes, or between adjacent layers of OPVs, multiple plasmonic mechanisms may occur and need to be distinguished to better understand plasmonic enhancement. Steady-state photophysics is a powerful tool for unraveling the plasmonic nature and revealing plasmonic mechanisms such as the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), the propagating plasmon-polariton (SPP), and the plasmon-gap mode. Furthermore, the charge transfer dynamics in the organic semiconductor materials can be elucidated from the transient photophysical investigations. In this review article, the basics of the plasmonic mechanisms and the related metallic nanostructures are briefly introduced. We then outline the recent advances of the plasmonic applications in OPVs emphasizing the linkage between the photophysical properties, the nanometallic geometries, and the photovoltaic performance of the OPV devices."

IZTO20 thin films were then deposited onto glass substrate at 400 °C by DC magnetron sputtering. The average optical transmittance determined by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy was higher than 85% for all films. The minimum resistivity of the annealed IZTO20 thin film was approximately 6.1×10-4 Ω·cm, which tended to increase with decreasing indium content. Substrate heating and annealing were found to be important parameters affecting the electrical and optical properties. An organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell was fabricated using the IZTO20 film deposited under the optimized condition as an anode electrode and the efficiency of up to 80% compared to that of a similar OPV cell using ITO film was observed. Reduction of surface roughness and electrical resistivity through annealing treatment was found to contribute to the improved efficiency of the OPV cell."

It has been revealed from experimental results that SWCNT has a significant effect on Rs. The values of Rs are measured from current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and also by utilizing the Cheung method. Obtained values from the Cheung method have been verified using H(I)–I plots for all dye-based devices. The extracted values using these two processes show a good consistency with each other. It is observed that Rs is reduced significantly by incorporating SWCNT for both dyes. The estimated amounts of reduction of Rs using SWCNT are 76.08% and 64.23% obtained from the I–V relationship whereas the value of Rs shows a reduction of 83.5% and 67.1% when measured by using the Cheung method for RB and MR dyes respectively. The ideality factor and barrier height of the diodes have also been extracted. The ideality factor has decreased with incorporation of SWCNT. A reduction in barrier height for the devices has also been observed in the presence of SWCNT.

A total of 58 SSR markers selected from a panel of 70 were used for genotyping three samples of 30, 50 and 100 plant bulks for each of 32 OPVs. The SSR markers detected a total of 253 alleles in the 32 maize OPVs across the three bulk samples. The number of alleles per marker varied from 2 to 7, with an overall mean of 4.36. The genetic distance among the OPVs varied from 0.17 to 0.93 with an average of 0.70 ± 0.007 for bulk samples of 30 plants, 0.20 to 0.91 with an overall mean of 0.70 ± 0.007 for bulk samples of 50 plants and from 0.30 to 0.95 with an average of 0.75 ± 0.006 for bulk samples of 100 plants. Cluster analysis separated the 32 maize OPVs into two major groups, which were further separated into two sub-groups for each type of bulk sample. The groupings of the OPVs into two major groups and their corresponding sub-groups was consistent with known breeding history (common parentage) and common target traits during development of the OPVs irrespective of the sample size used. However, in the bulk samples of 50 and 100 plants, some sub-groups were composed of OPVs with mixed maturity classes and diverse genetic backgrounds. Of the three independent bulk samples, the smallest sample size of 30 plants was found to be optimal for characterizing heterogeneous and heterozygous maize populations and OPVs owing to its cost-effectiveness and relative ease of sample processing."

The analysed factors that influenced the parameters of the layers were temperature and different gas atmosphere (N2, NO2). Samples were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry under the influence of a gas atmosphere. Moreover, morphology (sample roughness) and optical properties (refractive index, extinction coefficient) were measured of obtained thin films deposited on glass substrate using spin coating method. The study showed that obtained thin films of copolymers shows the possibility of using such polymers in the implementation of gas sensing structures."

It was used the bulk heterojunction architecture under the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7- Th:PC71BM/PFN/Field’s Metal (FM) and the active film thickness range was 40-165 nm. FM is a eutectic alloy, composed by 32.5% Bi, 51% In and 16.5% Sn, that melt at 65°C and is easily deposited on top of the electron transport layer (ETL) at low temperature (~ 90 °C). EQE set up was a home-made and the IQE spectra for the active film thickness range were determined from EQE and net internal absorption spectra; net absorption was estimated through the transfer matrix method (TMM). It was observed a significant reduction of IQE with the increasing of the active layer thickness up to 120 nm. IQE decreases and consequently EQE and PCE too because of the reduction in charge carriers collection. It was calculated the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from these measurements and compared these values with those achieved by the J-V plots to verify EQE results. It is noteworthy that EQE takes into account the effect of optical losses by reflection and transmission, while IQE is related with the efficiency of the photons that are not reflected or transmitted out of the cell."

For P1:PC71BM cells, an optimized-PCE of 19.2% was achieved under a 300 lux illumination of a 3000 K LED tube. Besides high PCEs, the porphyrin-based devices also exhibit enhanced OPV performances in thick film regions (∼200 nm) compared to a control BHJ cell using PCDTBT:PC71BM. The thick-film P1-based device shows an overall PCE of 18.2%. The origins of the thickness independent OPV performances were examined, and they can be attributed to the low electronic disorders of these materials when compared to their polymer counterparts."

Commonly, identical aromatic units are attached to the sides of the DPP unit, forming symmetric DPP polymers. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of DPP copolymers consisting of unsymmetric configurations of the side aromatics. The unsymmetric DPP copolymer with thienothiophene and benzene side moieties exhibits good solubility owing to the twisted dihedral angle at benzene and regiorandom configuration. A significant shallowing of the highest occupied molecular orbital level is observed in accordance with the electron-donating nature of the side units (benzene, thiophene, and thienothiophene). The overall power conversion efficiencies of the unsymmetric DPPs (2.3–2.4%) are greater than that of the centrosymmetric analogue (0.45%), which is discussed in view of bulk heterojunction morphology, polymer crystallinity, and space-charge-limited current mobilities. This comparative study highlights the effect of unsymmetric design on the molecular stacking and OPV performance of DPP copolymers."

With a binary bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) of PCDTBT:PC71BM organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.5% under indoor light sources (300 lux from fluorescence tube) was achieved. However, with a ternary BHJ cell of PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM, the PCE can be enhanced to 20.8%. FFs are the primarily improved in these devices. Transport and absorption measurements indicate the origins of the improvements of OPV performance: the ternary BHJ films exhibit enhanced hole mobilities and reduced Urbach energies, indicating that the blending of the PDTSTPD component passivates shallow traps near the band edges of the BHJ films."
302,302,10.1039/c7ta10995d,,,"Photobleaching dynamics in small molecule: Vs. polymer organic photovoltaic blends with 1,7-bis-trifluoromethylfullerene",2018,"Two organic photovoltaic (OPV) donor materials (one polymer and one small molecule) are synthesized from the same constituent building blocks, namely thiophene units, cyclopentathiophene dione (CTD), and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT). Photobleaching dynamics of these donor materials are then studied under white light illumination in air with blends of PC70BM and the bis-trifluoromethylfullerene 1,7-C60(CF3)2. For both the polymer and small molecule blends, C60(CF3)2 stabilizes the initial rate of photobleaching by a factor of 15 relative to PC70BM. However, once the small molecule:C60(CF3)2 blend bleaches to ∼80% of its initial optical density, the rate of photobleaching dramatically accelerates, which is not observed in the analogous polymer blend. We probe that phenomenon using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to measure PL quenching efficiencies at defined intervals during the photobleaching experiments. The data indicates the small molecule donor and C60(CF3)2 acceptor significantly de-mix with time, after which the blend begins to bleach at approximately the same rate as the neat donor sample. The work suggests that perfluoroalkylfullerenes have great potential to stabilize certain OPV active layers toward photodegradation, provided their morphology is stable."

The highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) as a semitransparent anode and alternative to Ag is sequentially spray-coated. We further utilize nitrogen (N2) plasma modification on the active layer for improving the compatibility between two layers in this work. With a combination of tuning the subsequent thermal treatment, the all-sprayed devices with good performance could be obtained. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.90% is achieved by optimizing the N2 plasma and thermal treatment, and the stability test is performed.

However, the progress made from this approach is quite limited because very few such hybrid solar cells can simultaneously show high short-circuit current (JSC ) and fill factor (FF). To find an appropriate NIR-absorbing BHJ is essential for highly efficient, organic, photovoltaics (OPV)/perovskite hybrid solar cells. The materials involved in the BHJ layer not only need to have broad photoresponse to increase JSC , but also possess suitable energy levels and high mobility to afford high VOC and FF. In this work, a new porphyrin is synthesized and blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to function as an efficient BHJ for OPV/perovskite hybrid solar cells. The extended photoresponse, well-matched energy levels, and high hole mobility from optimized BHJ morphology afford a very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) (19.02%) with high Voc , JSC , and FF achieved simultaneously. This is the highest value reported so far for such hybrid devices, which demonstrates the feasibility of further improving the efficiency of perovskite devices."

When PCEs were measured immediately after device fabrication, the optimum thickness was ~100 nm. It was, however, found that thick OPVs exhibit higher PCEs a few months later, whereas thin OPVs simply degraded with time. Consequently, the optimum thickness changed with time. Considering this fact, we discuss the relationship between the active-layer thickness and PCE."

The influences of incorporation of the isomeric rigid alicyclic structure onto the backbone of the polymers were systematically investigated in terms of optical, thermal, mechanical, dielectric and surface properties, respectively. Due to the moderate chemical imidization condition, CPI-x series retain higher glass transition temperature (Tg) in the range of 329–429 °C than the Tg of TPI-x (from 321.9 °C to 370.7 °C). Therefore, the CPI-1 film based 5-DAPI was chosen as the flexible substrate. MoO3 was chosen as the interface layer to improve the compatibility between PI substrate and the metal electrode. Then a ultra-thin layer of MoO3 (3 nm)/Au(2 nm)/Ag(4 nm) was utilized to be the transparent electrode. After annealing at 220 °C for 0.5 h, zinc oxide (ZnO) was deposited onto the electrode to maintain the superior electron mobility and improve the transparency of the electrode.

We performed a cross-sectional study of 6-month-old infants recruited at birth to the ZVITAMBO trial in Zimbabwe between 1997–2001, before introduction of prevention of mother-to-child transmission interventions. We measured poliovirus-specific IgA to type 1–3 polio strains by semi-quantitative capture ELISA in cryopreserved serum samples collected from 85 HEU and 101 HIV-unexposed infants at 6 months of age, one month after their last immunisation with trivalent OPV. Almost all infants were breastfed, with the majority in both groups mixed breastfed (70.6% HEU versus 71.3% HIV-unexposed).

The only problem with organic photovoltaic is that its low power conversion efficiency due to low photocurrent. Photocurrent is mainly effected by electrical mobility and also the device's thickness. A polymer call is a well used in organic photovoltaic but since it's a p-type material, it is low in electron mobility. In order to increase the mobility, a material that is high in electron mobility such as Graphene is added and mixed with Poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The main objective of this research is to study the effect of annealing temperature towards P3HT:Graphene thin film. Spin coating technique was used to fabricated the active layer onto the substrate. Characterization such as optical properties, surface morphology and electrical characterization is being measured and studied. Optimum annealing temperature for P3HT:Graphene device fabrication is obtain at 200°C due to its high absorbance and roughness.

Long technical strides need to be taken and efforts much beyond the laboratory solar cell need to be dedicated to bringing new solar cell material discoveries to service as an industrial technology. This includes scaled materials preparation, scaled manufacturing platforms, scaled installation platforms, as well as scaled electronics, monitoring, and control systems. We epitomize this as the ""scaling lag"" and highlight its importance when wishing to progress new solar cell materials from science to technology. The scaling gap is an observable element that can be extracted directly from experimental data and can be taken as a sign of technological maturity that can aid early-phase investors in their decision of when to invest in product development based on new technology."

Herein, solution-processable tetrabutylammonium halides (TBAXs, X = Cl, Br, and I) are employed as a cathode interlayer in inverted OPVs, leading to the disappearance of an S-shaped kink in their current density–voltage curves and increasing their open-circuit voltages and fill factors, which resulted in significantly enhanced power conversion efficiencies. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed that the work function of indium tin oxide (ITO) was considerably lowered in the presence of TBAX interlayers, resulting in efficient electron extraction from the C60 acceptor to the ITO bottom cathode and increasing the built-in potential across devices. Thus, TBAXs are demonstrated to be promising materials for efficient cathode interlayer formation in inverted OPVs."

In this work we utilise a gas cluster ion source for the controlled depth profiling of organic materials that would historically have been too fragile to analyse and obtain quantitative compositional data through the whole thickness of the film. In particular we examine the oxygen diffusion and photo-oxidation kinetics of one of the most commonly used electron acceptor materials for many organic optoelectronic applications, namely PC61BM, in both neat films and in blends with polystyrene. Exposure to AM1.5G light and air under ambient conditions, results in a higher level of surface oxidation of blended PC61BM:polystyrene than is observed for either pure control film. Gas cluster ion source depth profiling further confirms that this oxidation is strongest at the extreme surface, but that over time elevated oxygen levels associated with oxidised organic species are observed to penetrate through the whole blended film. The results presented herein provide further insights on the environmental stability of fullerene based organic optoelectronic devices."

However, current chalcogen-based conformational lock strategies for organic semiconductors are limited to S···X (X = O, N, halide) weak interactions. An easily accessible (minimal synthetic steps) and structurally planar selenophene-based building block, 1,2-diethoxy-1,2-bisselenylvinylene (DESVS), with novel Se···O noncovalent conformational locks is designed and synthesized. DESVS unique properties are supported by density functional theory computed electronic structures, single crystal structures, and experimental lattice cohesion metrics. Based on this building block, a new class of stable, structurally planar, and solution-processable conjugated polymers are synthesized and implemented in organic thin-film transistors (TFT) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. DESVS-based polymers exhibit carrier mobilities in air as high as 1.49 cm2 V-1 s-1 (p-type) and 0.65 cm2 V-1 s-1 (n-type) in TFTs, and power conversion efficiency >5% in OPV cells."

This milestone was one of the key criteria prompting the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to begin withdrawal of oral polio vaccines (OPV), beginning with the type 2 component (OPV2), through a globally synchronized initiative in April and May 2016 that called for all OPV using countries and territories to simultaneously switch from use of trivalent OPV (tOPV; containing types 1, 2, and 3 poliovirus) to bivalent OPV (bOPV; containing types 1 and 3 poliovirus), thus withdrawing OPV2. Before the switch, immunization programs globally had been using approximately 2 billion tOPV doses per year to immunize hundreds of millions of children. Thus, the globally synchronized withdrawal of tOPV was an unprecedented achievement in immunization and was part of a crucial strategy for containment of polioviruses. Successful implementation of the switch called for intense global coordination during 2015–2016 on an unprecedented scale among global public health technical agencies and donors, vaccine manufacturers, regulatory agencies, World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) regional offices, and national governments. Priority activities included cessation of tOPV production and shipment, national inventories of tOPV, detailed forecasting of tOPV needs, bOPV licensing, scaling up of bOPV production and procurement, developing national operational switch plans, securing funding, establishing oversight and implementation committees and teams, training logisticians and health workers, fostering advocacy and communications, establishing monitoring and validation structures, and implementing waste management strategies. The WHO received confirmation that, by mid May 2016, all 155 countries and territories that had used OPV in 2015 had successfully withdrawn OPV2 by ceasing use of tOPV in their national immunization programs. This article provides an overview of the global efforts and challenges in successfully implementing this unprecedented global initiative, including (1) coordination and tracking of key global planning milestones, (2) guidance facilitating development of country specific plans, (3) challenges for planning and implementing the switch at the global level, and (4) best practices and lessons learned in meeting aggressive switch timelines. Lessons from this monumental public health achievement by countries and partners will likely be drawn upon when bOPV is withdrawn after polio eradication but also could be relevant for other global health initiatives with similarly complex mandates and accelerated timelines."

The eradication of type 2 poliovirus, the absence of detection of type 3 poliovirus worldwide since November 2012, and cornering type 1 poliovirus to only a few geographic areas of 3 countries has enabled implementation of the endgame of polio eradication which calls for a phased withdrawal of oral polio vaccine beginning with the type 2 component, introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, strengthening of routine immunization in countries with extensive polio resources, and initiating activities to transition polio resources, program experience, and lessons learned to other global health initiatives. This supplement focuses on efforts by global partners to successfully launch polio endgame activities to permanently secure and sustain the enormous gains of polio eradication forever."

Effective implementation of IPV introduction and the switch from trivalent OPV (containing types 1, 2, and 3 poliovirus) to bivalent OPV (containing types 1 and 3 poliovirus) called for intense global communications and coordination on an unprecedented scale from 2014 to 2016, involving global public health technical agencies and donors, vaccine manufacturers, World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund regional offices, and national governments. At the outset, the new program requirements were perceived as challenging to communicate, difficult to understand, unrealistic in terms of timelines, and potentially infeasible for logistical implementation. In this context, a number of core areas of work for communications were established: (1) generating awareness and political commitment via global communications and advocacy; (2) informing national decision-making, planning, and implementation; and (3) in-country program communications and capacity building, to ensure acceptance of IPV and continued uptake of OPV. Central to the communications function in driving progress for objective 2 was its ability to generate a meaningful policy dialogue about polio vaccines and routine immunization at multiple levels. This included efforts to facilitate stakeholder engagement and ownership, strengthen coordination at all levels, and ensure an iterative process of feedback and learning. This article provides an overview of the global efforts and challenges in successfully implementing the communications activities to support objective 2. Lessons from the achievements by countries and partners will likely be drawn upon when all OPVs are completely withdrawn after polio eradication, but also may offer a useful model for other global health initiatives."

In order to mitigate the risks associated with country-level delays in implementing the switch, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative provided catalytic financial support to specific countries for operational costs unique to the switch. Between November 2015 and February 2016, a total of approximately US$19.4 million in financial support was provided to 67 countries. On average, country budgets allocated 20% to human resources, 23% to trainings and meetings, 8% to communications and advocacy, 9% to logistics, 15% to monitoring, and 5% to waste management. All 67 funded countries successfully switched from tOPV to bOPV during April–May 2016. This funding provided target countries with the necessary catalytic support to facilitate the execution of the switch on an accelerated timeline, and the mechanism offers a model for similar support to future global health efforts, such as the eventual global withdrawal of bOPV."

Safe execution of this switch required implementation of an associated independent monitoring strategy, the primary objective of which was verification that tOPV was no longer available for administration post-switch. This strategy had to be both practical and rigorous such that tOPV withdrawal could be reasonably employed and confirmed in all countries and territories within a discreet timeframe. Following these principles, WHO recommended that designated monitors in each of the 155 countries and territories visit all vaccine stores as well as a 10% sample of highest-risk health facilities within two weeks of the national switch date, removing any tOPV vials found. National governments were required to provide the WHO with formal validation of execution and monitoring of the switch. In practice, all countries reported cessation of tOPV by 12 May 2016 and 95% of countries and territories submitted detailed monitoring data to WHO. According to these data, 272 out of 276 (99%) national stores, 3,741 out of 3.968 (94%) regional stores, 16,144 out of 22,372 (72%) district level stores, and 143,050 out of 595,401 (24%) of health facilities were monitored. These data, along with field reports suggest that monitoring and validation of the switch was efficient and effective, and that the strategies used during the process could be adapted to future stages of OPV withdrawal."

The OPV heterojunction (HJ) consists of fullerene (C60) and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). According to the electrical characteristics of hole-only devices, it was found that charge generation mainly took place at the interface between MoO 3 and hole transport layer rather than the interface of C60–CuPc HJ under an electric field. The C60–CuPc HJ exhibited good charge generation in the presence of photons due to photovoltaic effect, despite its poorer charge generation upon an application of electric field. In addition, charges can be also generated at CuPc/MoO 3 interface upon a relatively high electric field since the absorption band of charge transfer complex formed by CuPc and MoO 3 is within visible region. These results, which had been rarely reported in the previous studies on OPV-type CGL, can well explain the experimental results of tandem organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with MoO 3 modified OPV-type CGLs."

The porphyrin dendrimers obtained showed a strong dependence on the type of connection of the dendritic branches. In the instance of the all trans -conformation linkages, an H-type aggregate is obtained for the linear OPV and strong J-aggregate for the ramified OPV. An adequate intramolecular energy transference stemming from the OPVs (donors) to the respective cores was observed. Furthermore, the number oligo( p -phenylene vinylene) (OPV) groups linked to the porphyrin system increase the energy transfer efficiency.

346,346,10.1002/vipr.201700645,,,Combined power of perovskites and silicon solar cells: Comparison between vapor-deposited and solution-processed perovskite layers,2017,"Summary 
The photovoltaic (PV) or solar cells technology can be categorised into two main groups, the wafer-based and thin-film based PVs. The wafer-based PVs include the commonly known crystalline silicon (c-Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) cells. The GaAs cells exhibit higher efficiency compared to crystalline silicon (c-Si) cells but it is the later that dominates the commercial market. Thin-film based (2nd Generation) PVs, including cadmium telluride (CdTe), amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS), generally absorb light more efficiently than wafer-based cells and can allow the use of materials in very thin films form. CdTe PVs have proven to be highly efficient but holds only a few percentage share of the market. There is still a need for more R&D before further commercialisation. 
 
An emerging and relatively new class of thin-film based photovoltaics (3rd Generation) technology that has the potential to overcome the current energy conversion efficiencies and performance by making use of novel materials. This class of PVs include organic photovoltaic (OPV), dye-synthesised solar cells (DSSC), quantum-dot (QD) and last but not least, the perovskite PV. Perovskite PVs can offer a low cost energy generation solution with the best device conversion efficiencies have shot from lower than 4% in 2009 to more than 21% in 2016. Perovskite based devices can be fabricated using vacuum thermal evaporation or by solution processing of the active layers. Although most recent perovskite solar cells with record efficiencies (>20%) are prepared via solution processing, the early breakthrough in perovskite solar cells was made with vacuum processed perovskites thin films. Vacuum thermal evaporation offers the ability and flexibility to prepare solar cell devices in various configuration. Recent developments in the field of perovskite demonstrates its compatibility with both, first and second generation PV technologies, and is therefore likely to be embraced by the conventional PV industry and make its way into utility-scale power generation."

Its incorporation into organic semiconducting materials is particularly interesting due to its structural resemblance to the more commonly used thiophene building block, thus allowing the optoelectronic properties of a material to be tuned without significantly perturbing its molecular structure. Here, we discuss the structural differences between thiazole- and thiophene-based organic semiconductors, and the effects on the physical properties of the materials. An overview of thiazole-based polymers is provided, which have emerged over the past decade for organic electronic applications and it is discussed how the incorporation of thiazole has affected the device performance of organic solar cells and organic field-effect transistors. Finally, in conclusion, an outlook is presented on how thiazole-based polymers can be incorporated into all-electron deficient polymers in order to obtain high-performance acceptor polymers for use in bulk-heterojunction solar cells and as organic field-effect transistors. Computational methods are used to discuss some newly designed acceptor building blocks that have the potential to be polymerized with a fused bithiazole moiety, hence propelling the advancement of air-stable n-type organic semiconductors."

The NiO x films, which are prepared by UV-ozone treating a nickel formate precursor, outperform the solar cells prepared in this study that use PEDOT:PSS as HTL. The power conversion efficiency improves from 5.3% to 6.1% when replacing PEDOT:PSS with NiO x . Unlike most conventional ways of fabricating solution processed NiO x HTLs, our method does not require high temperature (>300 °C). In fact, we were able to produce high performing NiO x HTLs without the use of any thermal annealing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that a mixture of oxides and hydroxides is formed as a result of the UV-ozone treatment, which differs in composition from those formed by high temperature annealing; UV-ozone treatment produces NiOOH, while only the high temperature annealing produces any significant amount of NiO. Contact potential difference (CPD) measurements reveal an increased work function for all UV-ozone treated NiO x films, consistent with the presence of NiOOH at the surface. The high work function of the UV-ozone treated NiO x films leads to an improved energy level matching between the donor and the HTL, resulting in higher fill factor and hole injection current."

By determination of the diffraction intensity per unit volume for both donor and acceptor, the volume content of pure, aggregated donor and acceptor in the blend can be determined. We find that for the small molecule X2:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) system, in contrast to most polymer systems, all the PCBM is aggregated, indicating there is negligible miscibility of PCBM with X2. This provides an explanation why the performance of OPV devices of X2:PCBM are high over a large range of PCBM concentrations. This is in contrast to many other OPV blends, where PCBM forms a mixed phase with the donor and does not provide sufficient transport for electrons when the PCBM concentration is low. This study demonstrates that a mixed phase is not necessarily a requirement for good OPV device performance."

These dyes can be further explored for their usefulness as donors in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The synthesised aza-BODIPYs were symmetrically substituted with aryl groups on the pyrrole rings. Among substituents investigated were triphenylamine, terthiophene, benzothiadiazole and thiophene. The photophysical properties of aza-BODIPYs were characterised by ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Aza-BODIPY dye with benzothiadiazole and triphenylamine substituents exhibits intense near-infrared red-shifts in absorption and emission. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been used to provide a guide to the structure-property relationships and electronic structures of the aza-BODIPYs. Evidence has been found of strong intramolecular-charge-transfer (ICT) character in the excited state. It has been proven how absorption and emission of aza-BODIPYs can be fine-tuned by manipulating the ICT between variously electronic donating and withdrawing substituents in the aza-BODIPY structure."

Thus, retrospective studies of the performance of cultivars used in China under water- limited conditions may provide some useful information and guidance for the improvement of maize yield. The objectives of the present study were to assess genetic gains in grain yield and the trends in related secondary traits, particularly increased drought-stress tolerance, in cultivars widely used in China from the 1950s to the 2000s. Trials were conducted at two locations (Sanya and Urumchi) under two water regimes per location during the 2010–2011 growing seasons. Results indicated that mean grain yield showed a significant linear increase from the 1950s to the 2000s, and that newer maize cultivars yielded more than older ones under either drought stress or fully irrigated treatments. The average yield gains under water-limited and unstressed environments were 62.6 and 100.3 kg ha −1 yr −1 respectively. Secondary traits associated with drought in maize have been improved over the past 50 years. The ASI and empty ear rate both decreased, while kernels per ear and weight per 100 kernels increased. The latter two parameters were the main sources of yield gain from 1950 to 2000 under drought stress treatment. To further improve yield under drought-stress conditions, the ASI and empty ear rate should both continue to be decreased during maize breeding. Further, genotypes with plant height and ear traits that are less affected by drought stress should be selected."

With a focus on accelerating the systematic morphology optimisation process, we demonstrate a technique offering rapid high-resolution, 3-dimensional blend morphology analysis in the scanning electron microscope. This backscattered electron imaging technique is used to investigate the morphological features and length-scales defining the promising PffBT4T-2OD:PC70BM blend system and show how its photovoltaic performance is related to the nature of its phase separation. Low-voltage backscattered electron imaging can be used to probe for structure and domain stacking through the thickness of the film, as well as imaging surface morphology with highly competitive spatial resolution. For reference, we compare our results with equivalent images of the widely studied P3HT:PC60BM blend system. Our results also demonstrate that backscattered electron imaging offers significant advantages over conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques, and show that it enables a fast, systematic approach to control 3-dimensional active layer morphology in polymer:fullerene blends."

It has been shown that changing the molecular composition of the polymers affects significantly their characteristics such as absorption spectrum, extinction coefficients, position of the frontier energy levels and charge carrier mobility. Power conversion efficiencies of 6.4–7.0% were obtained for the best-performing carbazole-rich and fluorene-rich terpolymers. Most importantly, we showed that optoelectronic properties (particularly, the extinction coefficients defining the light harvesting ability) and photovoltaic performances of conventional regioregular copolymers in the blends with [70]PCBM can be significantly improved simply by introducing a “rational disorder” in the polymer chains using statistical copolymerization of certain building blocks taken in appropriate ratios."

To study the effect of the ALD process on the organic materials forming the device, the precursor diffusion and intermixing at the interface during the growth of different plasma-assisted ALD inorganic barriers (i.e. Al2O3 and TiO2) onto the organic photoactive layer (P3HT:ICBA) was investigated. Depth profile x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the composition of the organic/inorganic interface to investigate the infiltration of the plasma-assisted ALD precursors into the photoactive layer as a function of the precursor dimension, the process temperature, and organic layer morphology. The free volume in the photoactive layer accessible to the ALD precursor was characterized by means of ellipsometric porosimetry (EP) and spectroscopic ellipsometry as a function of temperature. The organic layer is shown to exhibit free volume broadening at high temperatures, increasing the infiltration depth of the ALD precursor into the photoactive layer. Furthermore, based on previous investigations, the intrinsic permeation properties of the inorganic layers deposited by plasma-assisted ALD were predicted from the nano-porosity content as measured by EP and found to be in the 10−6 gm−2 d−1 range. Insight from our studies was used to design and fabricate multilayer barriers synthesized at near-room temperature by plasma-assisted ALD in combination with plasma-enhanced CVD onto organic photovoltaic (OPVs) devices. Encapsulated OPVs displayed shelf-lifetimes up to 1400 h at ambient conditions."

Here, we develop single layer graphene (SLG) films as transparent anodes for OPV cells that contain light-absorbing layers comprised of the evaporable molecular organic semiconductor materials, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)/fullerene (C60), as well as a molybdenum oxide (MoOx) interfacial layer. In addition to an increase in the optical transmittance, the SLG anodes had a significant decrease in surface roughness compared to two and four layer graphene (TLG and FLG) anodes fabricated by multiple transfer and stacking of SLGs. Importantly, the introduction of a MoOx interfacial layer not only reduced the energy barrier between the graphene anode and the active layer, but also decreased the resistance of the SLG by nearly ten times. The OPV cells with the structure of polyethylene terephthalate/SLG/MoOx/CuI/ZnPc/C60/bathocuproine/Al were flexible, and had a power conversion efficiency of up to 0.84%, which was only 17.6% lower than the devices with an equivalent structure but prepared on commercial indium tin oxide anodes. Furthermore, the devices with the SLG anode were 50% and 86.7% higher in efficiency than the cells with the TLG and FLG anodes. These results show the potential of SLG electrodes for flexible and wearable OPV cells as well as other organic optoelectronic devices."

Mechanistic studies disclose that the OPCBM treatment not only passivates the metal oxide surface defects, but also improves energetic alignment and conductivity of interlayer due to the excited charge transfer characteristics from azafulleroid to ZnOx. With the assistance of π-orbital hybridization from fullerene to the beneath ZnOx (through anchoring group), the electronic coupling and charge transfer from organics to metal oxide are effectively enhanced through the mediation of OPCBM modifier.

Part II: Calculation and standardization,2017,"Diffused IBC solar cells based on non-fire-through (NFT) metallization can achieve higher performance with respect to FT metallization, thanks to lower contact resistance. Less resistive contacts allows for lower metal fraction and thus lower contact recombination. For the application of NFT contacts, the rear side dielectric passivation layer needs to be locally opened. Standard processes for dielectric opening include laser ablation, use of etching pastes or masking and etching. In all this cases it is important that the opening process does not cause any damage to the diffusion below the contacts. We present a fast inspection method based on THz near-field scanning that allows investigating the diffusion layers after dielectric opening with spatial resolution suited for the small feature size of standard IBC solar cells. This method can be used to optimize crucial parameters of the dielectric opening without processing full cells. In this paper, we use THz scanning to optimize the curing temperature of the etch paste used to open the dielectric passivation layers on solar cells half-fabricates. After optimization, full cells are processed with top efficiency of 20.8%."
378,378,10.3389/fenrg.2016.00040,,,Indacenodithienothiophene-Based ternary organic solar cells,2017,"One of the key aspects to achieve high efficiency in ternary BHJ solar cells is the physical and chemical compatibility between the donor materials. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel conjugated polymer (P1) containing alternating pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) between two different donor fragments, dithienosilole (DTS) and indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT), used as a sensitizer in a host system of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene,2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (PIDTTQ) and [6,6]-phenyl C70 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). We found that the use of the same IDTT unit in the host and guest materials, does not lead to significant changes in the morphology of the ternary blend compared to the host binary. With the complementary use of optoelectronic characterizations, we found that the ternary cells suffer from a lower mobility-lifetime () product, adversely impacting the FF. However, the significant light harvesting in the NIR region improvement, compensating the transport losses, results in an overall power conversion efficiency enhancement of ~7% for ternary blends as compared to the PIDTTQ:PC71BM devices."

On the other hand, the aging/stability processes were also studied through single diode model, impedance spectroscopy and light-beam induced current (LBIC) measurements in accordance with the established ISOS-D1 (dark storage) and ISOS-L1 (illumination conditions) protocols. Results are a good indication that the alternative cathode Field’s metal (FM) cathode works as an encapsulating material and provides excellent PV performance comparable with the common and costly high-vacuum evaporated Al cathode."
383,383,10.1016/B978-0-12-803479-8.00001-2,,,Electronic properties and applications of fluorofullerenes,2017,"Fluorination of fullerenes has been intensely studied in the past 25 years, yielding many dozens of new molecules with diverse structures and properties. This chapter focuses on the overview of the fluorofullerenes that have been prepared reliably in gram quantities, and therefore represent not only fundamental interest, but are also viable for practical applications. Unprecedented improvements in electron-accepting properties of fullerenes upon fluorination have been demonstrated in the experimental and theoretical studies, and these results are compiled and critically analyzed in the chapter, revealing trends, current inconsistencies, and new directions for further research. Examples of the practical applications of fluorofullerenes as surface and bulk molecular dopants for inorganic and organic semiconductors are described, and the comparison with other nonfullerene dopants is provided."
389,389,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2017.2699230,,,Direct Visualization of Charge-Extraction in Metal-Mesh Based OPV Cells by Light-Biased LBIC,2017,"Metal-mesh based electrode systems are a highly conductive, versatile, and inexpensive alternative to ITO-electrodes for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. However, they do not offer full surface conductivity and are, therefore, usually combined with an additional conductive layer (e.g. PEDOT:PSS), which enables lateral charge-transport in the area in between the metal tracks. The sheet conductivity of this additional lateral conductive layer (LCL) needs to be carefully tuned with respect to the distance of the metal tracks to reduce short circuit current (Jsc) losses and additional series resistance due to resistive losses in the LCL material. Usually, this is done via electrical simulation or via analysis of IV-measurements of a large number of devices with different LCL sheet conductivities. Here, we present the light-biased light-beam-induced-current (LB-LBIC) measurement technique as a direct way to visualize current collection losses due to PEDOT:PSS sheet resistance in metal mesh/bus bar based OPV cells. We demonstrate that with LB-LBIC we are not only able to visualize and optimize lateral charge extraction under real-device operation conditions in OPV cells based on a high-resolution metal mesh but can measure the PEDOT:PSS sheet resistance in operating OPV devices as well."
397,397,10.1007/978-3-319-28338-8_13,,,Near-infrared sensitization of polymer/fullerene solar cells: Controlling the morphology and transport in ternary blends,2017,"The concept of near-infrared (NIR) sensitization can be used as an alternative strategy to extend the spectral sensitivity of wide-bandgap polymers in polymer/fullerene solar cells. In ternary systems consisting of a conjugated polymer donor, a fullerene acceptor, and a sensitizer, the fullerene needs to act as an electron acceptor as well as an electron-transport matrix, the polymeric donor should provide a sufficiently high hole mobility, and the sensitizers should sensitize the bulk heterojunction solar cell in the red/NIR region. So far we have used various optoelectrical and structural techniques to investigate the possible mechanisms of the charge transfer and charge transport among the three components and microstructure of the ternary blends. In this review-like chapter, we present our recent achievements on developing the concept of NIR sensitization for polymer/fullerene solar cells by mainly addressing the important aspect of the relationship between morphology and transport."
403,403,10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.06.183,,,Effect of time and deposition method on quality of phosphonic acid modifier self-assembled monolayers on indium zinc oxide,2016,"Abstract Phosphonic acid (PA) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are utilized at critical interfaces between transparent conductive oxides (TCO) and organic active layers in organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). The effects of PA deposition method and time on the formation of close-packed, high-quality monolayers is investigated here for SAMs fabricated by solution deposition, micro-contact printing, and spray coating. The solution deposition isotherm for pentafluorinated benzylphosphonic acid (F 5 BnPA) on indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) is studied using polarization modulation-infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) at room temperature as a model PA/IZO system. Fast surface adsorption occurs within the first min; however, well-oriented high-quality SAMs are reached only after ∼48 h, presumably through a continual process of molecular adsorption/desorption and monolayer filling accompanied by molecular reorientation. Two other rapid, soak-free deposition techniques, micro-contact printing and spray coating, are also explored. SAM quality is compared for deposition of phenyl phosphonic acid (PPA), F 13 -octylphosphonic acid (F 13 OPA), and pentafluorinated benzyl phosphonic acid (F 5 BnPA) by solution deposition, micro-contact printing and spray coating using PM-IRRAS. In contrast to micro-contact printing and spray coating techniques, 48–168 h solution deposition at both room temperature and 70 °C result in contamination- and surface etch-free close-packed monolayers with good reproducibility. SAMs fabricated by micro-contact printing and spray coating are much less well ordered."
404,404,10.1161/JAHA.116.004385,,,Endothelial Function Assessed by Automatic Measurement of Enclosed Zone Flow-Mediated Vasodilation Using an Oscillometric Method Is an Independent Predictor of Cardiovascular Events,2016,"Background A new device for automatic measurement of flow‐mediated vasodilation (FMD) using an oscillometric method has been developed to solve technical problems of conventional FMD measurement. This device measures enclosed zone FMD (ezFMD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of endothelial function assessed by ezFMD for future cardiovascular events. Methods and Results We measured ezFMD in 272 participants who underwent health‐screening examinations. First, we investigated cross‐sectional associations between ezFMD and cardiovascular risk factors, and then we assessed the associations between ezFMD and first major cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, and coronary revascularization). Univariate regression analysis revealed that ezFMD was significantly correlated with age, triglycerides, glucose, smoking pack‐years, estimated glomerular filtration rate, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, and Framingham risk score. During a median follow‐up period of 36.1 months (interquartile range 18.8–40.1 months), 12 participants died (6 from cardiovascular causes), 3 had stroke, 8 had coronary revascularization, and 10 were hospitalized for heart failure. There was no episode of acute coronary syndrome during the study period. Participants were divided into tertiles (low, intermediate, and high) based on ezFMD. Kaplan–Meier curves for first major cardiovascular events among the 3 groups were significantly different (P=0.004). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the low group was significantly associated with an increased risk of first major cardiovascular events compared with the high group (hazard ratio 6.47; 95% CI 1.09–125.55; P=0.038). Conclusions These findings suggest that endothelial function assessed by ezFMD may be useful as a surrogate marker of future cardiovascular events.

408,408,10.1016/j.orgel.2016.10.016,,,XPS analysis of the chemical degradation of PTB7 polymers for organic photovoltaics,2016,"Abstract The chemical degradation of the Poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5- b' ]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4- b ]thiophenediyl]] or ‘ PTB7’ has been studied using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). This material system appears to be intrinsically unstable especially when illuminated in air and XPS studies confirm the rapid photo-degradation is related to changes in chemical structure of the polymer. In particular, XPS spectra show an initial reduction in relative C C intensity, suggests loss of the alkoxy side chains. This is followed by a dramatic increase in the level of oxygen-bonded species, especially C O at ∼286.5 eV and C(=O)O at 289.2 eV, indicative of COOH and OH group formation, and oxidation of S. The XPS results support the view that using processing additives reduces the chemical stability of the polymer and provides insight into strategies to improve molecular design to ensure higher chemical stability."
